And now, I would like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings\u2019 fourth quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results that were a bit better than the expectations we talked about on our last earnings call. David will provide the details on the fourth quarter results in his remarks. For my time, I will first briefly reflect on our execution during the extremely difficult year of 2020. Then I will share our thoughts and strategic priorities for 2021 and beyond. Without a doubt 2020 presented the biggest disruption to modern global travel the world has ever seen and our results for full year 2020 were down substantially from 2019. However, travelers still book 355 million room nights through our platforms during 2020 and we remain profitable by generating approximately $880 million in adjusted EBITDA. Delivering these results during this unprecedented and unpredictable year is a credit to our team\u2019s relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and to our supply partners while all the time remaining incredibly focused on operating efficiently. When we spoke to you on our earnings call in May of 2020, we outlined a series of plans that would help us navigate through the COVID-19 crisis. First, we said we would stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis. Second, we said we would optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. And third, we said we would position the business to be able to capture travel demand when it returns. Based on our accomplishments in 2020, I can confidently say that we executed well against these plans. In the beginning of the crisis, we successfully stabilized the business by taking several immediate steps including, quickly closing offices and smoothly transitioning to a distributed work environment to protect the health and safety of our employees, which was and continues to be a top priority, working closely with travelers and supply partners to process the unprecedented level of travel changes and cancellations, and bolstering liquidity and preserving cash by holding stock buybacks cutting non-essential costs and raising over $4 billion in capital through a debt offering. And we began the process and have almost entirely completed our work to optimize the business for the decrease in travel demand through the restructuring actions we have taken at each of our brands across the company. As a result of these actions, our 2020 year end headcount decreased approximately 23% versus 2019, primarily in volume-related position. We expect these reductions to result in annualized cost savings of about $370 million in personnel expenses with about $110 million of savings recognized in 2020. All our work is never done in terms of finding opportunities for cost efficiencies. We believe the headcount reductions needed to optimize the business for the current demand environment are now generally behind us. Finally, we believe we have positioned the business well for when travel demand returns. We continue to make progress against our key strategic priorities during 2020 and this progress has continued as we have moved into 2021. We remain active in performance marketing channels, and are being agile and adapting our approach to this very uncertain environment, and we will leverage our learnings from the past year to continue to capture demand in these performance channels at appropriate ROIs. In addition, our marketing team has been working hard to develop campaigns and messaging that we will deploy when we believe the time is right to encourage people to travel once again and use our services. As we think ahead about 2021, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact shape and timing of the recovery for travel. The rate of recovery will depend heavily on the rate of new COVID-19 cases, including new potentially more transmissible and more dangerous variants and on the timing of effective and broad based vaccine distribution, which we believe will be a key step in helping people feel safe to travel again. We are tracking early signs of encouraging summer booking trends in Western Europe, primarily the U.K. and Germany, relative to what we are seeing globally. Although in each case, gross booking levels are still below where we were at the same point in time in 2019. While seeing green shoots of a summer booking season positive, it\u2019s uncertain whether these trends will continue and whether we will see this summer booking strength expand into other countries and regions, and of course, whether these advanced will turn into stayed room nights, or will be canceled. What would be most helpful will be continued government action around the world to accelerate vaccine distribution, while providing direct and indirect support to the entire travel and hospitality industry. Additionally, international travel remains extremely depressed and recovery will not be possible until government restrictions on international travel are lifted or modified to travelers who can show they are safe travelers are allowed to travel freely. As you know, our International business has been a great advantage for us historically and we expect it will be in the future, but we anticipate this to be a longer recovery. We know that people have a very strong desire to travel. We saw this first hand in 2020 when we witnessed a strong improvement in our booking trends from the lows of April through the peak summer travel season, driven in part by pent-up demand as people came out of lockdowns. The travel that was booked last year was much more domestic-oriented than in prior years as many people adapted to the restricted travel environment and still found a way to take a trip. With many travel restrictions now in place around the world, we believe there is once again a high level of pent-up demand for travel. But when this demand will be fully unlocked is of course difficult to predict and it will depend on vaccination rates and other factors. While the trending of the pickup in travel demand is beyond our control, we are focused on things we can control, primarily better positioning our business by continuing to invest and execute against our key strategic priorities including, expanding the payment platform at Booking.com, building out our Connected Trip capabilities and growing our market share in the United States. Our integrated payment platform at Booking.com provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. It is strategically important as it enables merchandising capabilities that we haven\u2019t had access to historically at Booking.com, but we expect to utilize selectively in the future to help drive growth. In addition, this payment platform is foundational for enabling our Connected Trip strategy. We continue to make progress expanding the payment platform with approximately 22% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings in 2020 processed on the platform. This was up from approximately 15% in 2019 and was less than 4% back in 2017. So this is a dramatic shift in our large-scale business. We are optimistic about recent improvements in our Booking.com U.S. payment platform, which will enable increased utilization of payments in this critical market. We expect to see a higher percentage of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings processed on the payment platform in 2021 as compared to 2020 and expect these increases to continue beyond 2021. Our Connected Trip vision is a multi-parted offering including accommodations, flights, ground transportation and attractions in dining connected by our seamless payment network and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence to provide a frictionless experience for our bookers all the way from the initial booking to experiencing their trip. We are building towards this vision, because we believe that Connected Trip will drive increased loyalty and frequency and will enhance the growth of our accommodation business to additional customer acquisition and merchandising opportunities. Developing a robust flight product at Booking.com remains an important strategic component of the Connected Trip, as it gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other products to those bookers. In the coming years, we expect flights will represent an increasing mix of our overall business, which will help drive incremental revenue and EBITDA dollars. As mentioned in the past growing our share of the U.S. travel market remains a key strategic priority for our company as the U.S. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we have historically under indexed there. We are taking several steps to increase our competitiveness in the U.S. market and are focused on making sure we are offering great value to our customers, improving our payments platform to enable bundling and merchandising opportunities, increasing overall consumer awareness of our Booking.com through marketing and expanding our alternative accommodation supply. While we have built a large and competitive alternative accommodations business globally, we believe we have a significant opportunity for improvement in the United States, which will involved, product improvements, supply acquisition and raising consumer awareness of this type of inventory on Booking.com. The key to invest and execute against these three strategic priorities as when we capture demand as travel recovers will be our focus in 2021. We believe successful implementation of these priorities is key to achieve higher growth rates, increasing market share and eventually building a larger business with higher earnings than we had prior to COVID. We expect this larger business to have a higher mix of merchant transactions and non-accommodation products, both of which will negatively impact our EBITDA margin rates. But we expect to continue to lead the travel industry in this metric. Finally, I want to address the European Commission\u2019s initial proposal from the Digital Marketing Act and Digital Services Act released in December. The European Commission has proposed regulations and to keeping markets fair and open, which is an ambition that we support. However, at the present time, it is not known for certain what the ultimate rules will be, how they might be applied or what the impact will be on us and other market participants. We are engaged with state service to work towards regulations to tackle the legitimate problems of the large gatekeepers in the digital community of which we believe we are not one. We will update you in the area during future calls. In conclusion, there are still tough days ahead of us and everyone in the travel industry. COVID case counts remain high and the wider global distribution of vaccines is still too slow. However, I am more confident than ever in our long-term future and we will at some point see a strong recovery in travel demand. I firmly believe that our company is very well-positioned to capture this demand as it comes back. In the meantime, we will focus on what we can control, namely investing in our business and executing against our strategic priorities to ensure we exit this crisis on a strong footage, which will enable us to build a larger and faster growing business over the long run. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we have seen so far in the first quarter and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer term operating model. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates for 2020 and 2021 are relative to comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now onto the results for the fourth quarter. On our November earnings call, we discussed the trends we saw throughout the third quarter and into early November, including the year-on-year decline in reported room nights worsening from about 43% in the third quarter to about 58% in October and then further deteriorating to about 70% over the seven-day leading up to our November earnings call, driven by rising COVID case counts, and many European countries and governments beginning to respond with imposition of travel restrictions. As a reminder, reported room nights include the impact of cancellations. The worsening trends we saw in early November, improved a little resulting in our reported room nights declining 60% for the full quarter. November proved to be the low point for the quarter. The decline in room night growth rates versus Q3 were driven by Europe, where growth rate declined quite considerably. Looking across the other regions North America were similar to Q3 and Asia and the rest of world both improved compared to Q3. North America was the strongest region in Q4 with significantly lower year-on-year earlier decline in room nights than the other regions. Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps continued to gain share in the fourth quarter and represented over two-thirds of our total room nights in Q4 and about two-thirds of 2020. We continue to see -- we also continue to see growth in 50% of our total room nights come to us through the direct channel. Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q4, up significantly versus 2019, which was just below 50%. Our cancellation rates continue to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and also increased versus Q3. We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com customer booking behavior. The mix of customers booking alternative accommodations in Q4 was slightly lower than Q4 2019, while the full year was up slightly versus 2019. The slight decline in the overall mix of alternative accommodations in Q4 was due to the underperformance of the European region, which is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. The mix of alternative accommodations continued to increase year-over-year within Europe in Q4. Booking.com\u2019s alternative accommodations represented about 30% of its reported room nights for the full year 2020. The booking with the contracted versus 2019 in the fourth quarter are about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter as customers continue to focus mainly on the short-term travel needs. Gross bookings declined 65% in Q4, which is a great decline in reported room nights, due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of $1.2 billion and decreased 63% year-over-year. As we expected, revenue in the quarter was less negatively impact than gross bookings due to the fact that revenue benefited from check-ins in Q4 from bookings received in the relatively strong third quarter. Our full year revenue was also significantly less impacted than our gross bookings driven by the differences in the timing between fees and revenue, which is recognized as check-in primarily related to 2019 bookings that check-in, in Q1 2020. As a result of these coming factors, our full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 19.2%, which is significantly higher than the 15.6% in 2019 and 2018. If our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in 2020 been in line with 2019, revenue would have been more than $1 billion lower for the full year. The difference between 15.6% and 19.2% is almost entirely explained by this timing difference. The 63% reduction in revenue resulted in adjusted EBITDA loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter. While we significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q4. As Glenn mentioned, we have almost entirely completed our restructuring actions, reduced personnel expenses to align our cost structure with the new demand environments. The savings recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions was about $70 million in Q4 and about $110 million for the full year. We recorded charges of $74 million and $149 million related to these actions in the restructuring and other exit cost line for Q4 and the full year respectively. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line decreased 61% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environments. Sales and other expenses decreased 45% year-over-year, primarily due to a reduction in expenses associated with payments transactions, partially offset by a mix shift in customer service to outsourced call centers. Personnel expenses decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to restructuring actions I mentioned previously. G&A expenses decreased 36% year-over-year, largely driven by reduced discretionary expense in such areas as T&E, lower indirect taxes and lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to investments in software license fees related to cyber security and privacy software. Finally, we have broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L and I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $23 million in the quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 42% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impact of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings, as well as the geographical distribution of earnings and losses. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was driven by change in our full year tax provision following better than expected pretax results in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $153 million in Q4. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $165 million in the quarter, as the benefit from an unrealized $553 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan was offset by income tax expenses of $410 million, $98 million of interest expense and $61 million of FX re-measurement losses on our euro bond. We excluded the unrealized gains and the re-measurement losses from our non-GAAP results. The $410 million of income tax expenses is primarily due to the discrete tax expense related to the Meituan unrealized gain and the change in our full year tax provision, following better than expected results in the fourth quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate of 90% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 18% due to the reasons mentioned from non-GAAP tax rate with the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, driving an additional significant impact. Now onto our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance decreased to $14.8 billion from our September ending balance of $14.9 billion due to an operating cash outflow largely offset by the unrealized gains on our long-term investments. We had a $557 million operating cash outflow in the quarter driven primarily by changes in working capital, which represented a use of cash of about $400 million in the quarter, as well as a net loss recorded in the quarter. The change in working capital driven by seasonal effects were amplified by the slowdown in bookings from Q3. We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic and consistent with our comments last quarter, we have halted repurchases of our stock and will not initiate repurchase until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. Now on to our thoughts for the first quarter and to remind you we will make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of the recovery for travel, which means we are unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. January room night declines were slightly worse in Q4, driven by the increasing spread of COVID-19, including the new strains with associated additional travel restrictions. However, starting in middle of January, we saw an improvement in room night declines driven by domestic travel bookings in most part of the world and we have seen this improvement continue into February. In recent weeks, some regions have improved back to positive domestic room night growth. While difficult to predict with accuracy, if the domestic room night trends continued to improve, Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. To give you a snapshot of what we are seeing recently room night declines of last seven days were about 50%, In Q1, the overall booking window is contracted versus 2019, although to a lesser extent that we saw in the fourth quarter. In Western Europe in January, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019 and we have seen this expansion continue into February as the share of further out bookings including those for summer travel has increased. As Glenn noted in Western Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany we have recently seen stronger summer booking trends relative to what we are seeing globally and in these countries gross bookings for the summer period are 25% of where they were at the same time in 2019. These stronger booking trends in Western Europe are currently being offset by weaker near-term booking trends in the region due to extensive travel restrictions and we remind you that the significant majority of the summer bookings are cancellable. We are also encouraged to see that some countries are making notable progress in vaccinations including Israel, UAE and the U.K. We are confident that when vaccinations are broadly available and when travel restrictions are lifted people will return to travel. We saw this happen recently in Israel where vaccination rates are the highest in the world and after the national lockdown within Israel was eased on February 7th, we quickly saw domestic bookings return to solid double-digit growth versus the same period in 2019. Turning to the income statement, as I said, we expect Q1 room nights declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. We expect Q1 gross bookings to decline a few percentage points more than room nights due to continued pressure on local currency ADRs. We expect Q1 revenue to decline slightly more than gross bookings assuming bookings continue to improve for the rest of the quarter. We expect marketing expense in Q1 will decline at the same level as gross bookings. We expect sales and other expenses in Q1 will be similar to what they were in Q4 on a dollar basis with some variability based upon where Q1 volumes land. We expect personnel expenses in Q1 where we saw higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased SBC expenses and seasonal increase in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to the restructuring actions we have taken. We expect that almost a full run rate from our personnel restructurings will be realized in Q1. We expect G&A expenses in Q1 will be about the same as it were in Q4 on a dollar basis. We expect that IT expenses will be higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased investments in security, data privacy and some operational system enhancements. We currently estimate the remaining restructuring charge related to actions of Booking.com will be about $40 million and we expect to record more than half of these remaining charges in the first quarter. About half of the $40 million related to personnel related actions and the other half relates to real estate. Given what we just explained and to remind you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest revenue quarter, we expect to report a greater EBITDA loss in Q1 than in Q4. For full year 2021, I want to briefly walk you through some factors that we expect will impact our topline operating margins for the year. We expect the environment of travel to improve during 2021, but the shape and timing of that recovery remains uncertain. We expect occupancy rates to remain below where they were pre-COVID putting continued negative pressure on ADRs, which will result in our gross bookings being lower than our room nights. As I alluded earlier, our revenue was less negatively impacted than our gross bookings in 2020 due to timing factors, which benefited our 2020 revenue by more $1 billion. The opposite dynamic will happen when we experience acceleration in bookings, which will lead to our gross bookings recovering faster than revenue. Said another way, if we see this acceleration in 2021 there will be more bookings made in 2021 that will check-in in 2022 than there were bookings made in 2020 that check-in in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, but exactly how meaningful this impact will be depends upon how quickly our room nights and gross bookings accelerate in 2021. Due to these differences and the timing of bookings versus check-in, we also expect deleverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our marketing expenses at the time of booking. The most significant expense items in sales and other are payment processing costs and outsourced customer service expenses. We expect sales and other to be lower in 2021 than in 2019. The reduction will be smaller than the reduction in revenue. A few comments to help you think about our less variable expenses to 2021 and how they will most likely compare with 2019. We expect G&A to be down double digits versus 2019 driven by T&E, office and occupancy expenses, with some variability from GST taxes if new ones are enacted during the year. Personnel expenses are likely to be quite similar to 2019 on a dollar basis. To help you understand this better, there are a few factors that contribute towards this. Our personnel expense run rate immediately before COVID hit was about $200 million higher than 2019 actual personnel expenses. Less than half of this was the annualization of people expense we added during 2019 and the rest was from people expense added to the business in the first quarter of 2020. Our restructuring actions will reduce headcount expenses by approximately $370 million. So an impact of these two together will be to reduce personnel expenses by $170 million versus 2019. As we continue to invest in the business, we expect 2021 year-end headcount to be a little higher than at the end of 2020 with a mix shift towards product and technical positions. This will add about $100 million in personnel expenses in 2021. And finally SBC is expected to be higher than 2019 due to due to a few factors including the modification of some stock awards in Q1 2021 and the issuance of stock options in 2020. Finally, IT expenses in 2021 will be higher than in 2019 due to investments in security, privacy and operational system enhancements as reported to our Connected Trip strategy. As we think beyond 2021, we are looking forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings that we had prior to COVID. We will also focus on the potential for higher growth and market share. We continue to believe it will be years and not quarters before travel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. And when considering the shape of the business at that time, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to two factors. The first is a mix shift within the business. The continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other connected verticals will add revenue and EBITDA but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations. Payments will add to revenue with offsetting expenses in sales and other plus some additional personnel and other expenses. Flights and other connected verticals will add to bookings and revenue but at lower take rates on accommodations and will also require added personnel and other expenses as these business scales. The second is personnel. The restructuring actions we took in 2020 were mainly in volume related functions including customer service and credit collection. This means that as volumes grow beyond the levels we expect in 2021, we will need to add expenses back to business. As we mentioned before, we look to do this in cost efficient ways but the work will come back. We think it\u2019s important to include this consideration when thinking about the future shape of the business. As Glenn said, we expect to continue to have industry leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely at levels below those in 2019. In conclusion, we remain focused on what we can control and continue to execute against our strategic priorities. We are now more confident than ever that through these actions we will emerge from this crisis in a stronger position. We will now take your questions, and Grace, I will turn it over to you to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks for the questions. I guess a couple, first, just following up on those last comments you made, David on margins. I guess, obviously, a lot of the reductions you have seen as you said, been kind of variable related to business. Are there -- is there anything that you are kind of just learning to do better or more efficiently that might result in kind of better cost line items as a percent of revenue coming out of this on the other side? And then, I guess, the second one, curious if you guys expect any impact to your performance marketing spend efficacy from kind of upcoming changes in Apple\u2019s iOS 14 that may impact retargeting, anything you guys expect there? Thanks.\nDavid Goulden: Yeah. Why don\u2019t I take the first one and then Glenn will -- see if you want to take a start on the second one. So, on the efficiency side, we are always looking for ways to become more efficient within the business. As I mentioned, we have reduced these variable cost to the tune of about $370 million. As they come back, we will look at more efficient ways of getting that work done. The work will come back. It won\u2019t come back this year. We basically right-sized ourselves to what we think will be through 2021, but as volumes extend beyond what we think 2021 is likely to bring those costs will come back. So we will look more efficient ways to do some of those variable activities in terms of location, technology, where we do them inside or where we deploy more partner resources, et cetera. And we also Lloyd, continue to look at how we can drive efficiencies in our fixed cost part of the business. That\u2019s not been the major focus for the last 12 months. The major focus being surviving COVID, I think, we have done a good job with that. But we do continue to kind of look at our costs across our personnel base, across our real estate, across our technology portfolios, across things like procurement, where we can continue to drive efficiencies within the business. So when we get to a more normalized environment that\u2019s something else we can also take a look at driving as well.\nGlenn Fogel: And Lloyd.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks a lot.\nGlenn Fogel: Your question is good one because we continue to see changes not only by companies like Apple making changes, you just mentioned, but Google doing differences and government certainly talking about laws and regulations about cookies and all sorts of things that impact different ways that people do marketing, in particular performance marketing and different things and that can impact companies, certainly in the short-term and we are all just looking and trying to evaluate what do we think this will mean for any one of these things. But the thing I am really focused on is that change can also be good. We believe that we have some of the best marketing people in the world in terms of digital marketing. So when changes happen we can make adjustments, we can make changes, we can do things faster and better and we have so much data to test with that we believe we can actually come out of these things sometimes better off than we were in the past. So right now, there is nothing I can say in terms of impact or not. It took us so far as to say we have been adapting and changing as the world of digital marketing has been changing for 20 years and we have kept on top of it and so I am so confident that we will be able to make any adjustments we need to make for the future.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. A couple of questions, first, Airbnb success has been hard to miss, but just wondering how you think about your market share within Europe and your position with a larger host maybe than smaller individual host and what that means in a recovery? And then, secondly, Glenn, would love to hear about your thoughts on suppliers, obviously, a lot of pain in the travel industry. How can you help suppliers in the recovery and do you think you will be getting more promotional activity from suppliers, maybe better take rates, anything we could think about on that front? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. So in regards to the whole alternative accommodations, we would like to call it in Europe. I don\u2019t think we talk much about regional exact share and I am not going to here. But I certainly, we talked a little bit how Europe is our stronghold in that area. We are better there in the home area, other areas. But throughout the world I think I can say to you that we are better in things that are less single property. We always want to increase the single property, because we know that\u2019s an area where we can improve upon. So that is an issue right now and with the pandemic there certainly was a bit of a shift for some people that they wanted to be isolated away from other people. So certainly, there was more demand than the past for the single home area. That showed much more in the U.S. for us than Europe because Europe we do have a greater amount of our home supply is single property than say in the U.S. Look, it\u2019s an area where we to continue to focus on and I do believe right now in the environment there is, that is a great product to have up on the shelf. That being said, in the future, we will see how much that maintains or things go back more towards they used to be where there is a different split between homes and hotels. In regard to your second question about relationship with hotel suppliers, obviously, we are doing everything we can to help our partners. The next come up with new ways to come up with promotions that they want to do, telling them what we think their spots of demand that they can come up with give and take a closed user group prices they can help get the more demand, coming out with ways they can put together things in content in terms of safety and health so that a traveler who looks on our sites, sees their hotel and sees that is a safe place to go, do all different things with them to try and improve their business. It\u2019s very difficult right now, as you know because let\u2019s face it, unless we see a demand, if you can have the greatest content in the world where people don\u2019t trying to travel, they are not going to travel. But we are going to continue to do that. I do believe in terms of relationships, certainly, as a distributor, when there is less demand we are more valuable as a partner to them. And the time when there is very, very high occupancy rates, any hotels I don\u2019t need the distributor nearly as much, but when they don\u2019t have as much occupancy rate then they start looking for demand and we have the benefit of being the largest platform for hotel demand in the world. So we are in a place for them to come and get some more of that incremental demand and we are continuing to work with them to make sure they do their best to get it.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Your line is open.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks a lot. I just had some follow-ups on your comments about gaining market share in the U.S. Can you talk more about your focus there? Do you consider it an increasing priority for the company compared to the past year or two and on the marketing side of that that you mentioned do you anticipate being focused more on brand or performance marketing?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, let me start with the first one, Kevin. We absolutely have begun to focus more on the U.S. It\u2019s always been a priority. So don\u2019t get me wrong in that area. But certainly we have made a couple of changes. We are focusing more specifically in the U.S. As we scale the company over many, many years we had a very global presence and we try not to make changes solely for any particular market, really believing that scaling the business we have it and the same was the best way to achieve a very, very large global share of the business. That being said, we have come to a state where we recognize that we continue to be under indexed in the U.S. and maybe we need to make some changes there, which we are doing and I think that we will make some progress in that. In terms of whether we are going to do a brand or in terms of performance marketing, I am not going to give away the playbook here. I will say though, we are absolutely doing the things I talked about in my prepared remarks in terms of obviously we do want to increase awareness, we obviously want to increase the total amount of supply, increase our alternative accommodation, doing all the things that are necessary to make sure we are getting the share of the business that we believe we should be getting.\nKevin Kopelman: Got it. That\u2019s great. And then just a quick clarification on the statistic you gave about the past week being down 50%. Is that a year-over-year numbers and if you are looking at 2020 were those numbers affected by the initial COVID waves at all?\nDavid Goulden: Kevin, as I said, everything is over two years number. We do\u2026\nKevin Kopelman: Okay. Perfect.\nDavid Goulden: \u2026 everything I gave you because that way you can you make a direct comparison with how things are doing relative to how they are doing in Q4 continues with this trend line. You can do the math yourself to figure what you meant on a year-on-year basis\u2026\nKevin Kopelman: Okay.\nDavid Goulden: \u2026 your number.\nKevin Kopelman: Perfect. And the regional numbers that you gave was that based on where the accommodation is located or where the customer is located?\nDavid Goulden: We gave you regional flavor not color. That is typically based upon where the customer is located. It\u2019s a book region view.\nKevin Kopelman: Perfect. Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up we have Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much. Maybe two if I can. Following up on the comments you have made around brand and maybe some of the changes we will see in digital advertising, whether it be first-party data or third-party data. How important do you see the concept of sort of aligning your brand with consumer maybe even build greater depth and loyalty and rewards programs going forward, especially if you are aiming again sort of a wider revenue pool and a wider product set, love to get your thoughts there Glenn? And where the world has begun to open up a little bit where you have some exposure. Can you give us a little bit of sense of how you sort of the pace of leaning back in to marketing channels and that deleverage that maybe you guys are calling out as things get better. Just so we can better understand a little bit of a timing mismatch there? Thanks so much.\nGlenn Fogel: Yeah. So, Eric, loyalty is an important thing because it really talks about something that we talk about a lot is bringing people home direct to us and we have talked about this numerous times of how we believe getting people to come back to us directly is a critical part of the strategy going forward. And certainly one of the ways we do that is by providing our loyalty version, which is our genius plan at Booking.com which really does we believe give some real value to consumers and that\u2019s something that we are going to continue on. Because in the end it costs an awful lot of money as we hope to get a new customer. It\u2019s cheaper to keep them. So we are going to keep on doing all the things we can to keep people coming back direct. And you are right about first-party, it could be third-party and all these different ways that we worry about how we are going to get through to the come in the future, certainly important to get new customers, but also real important to keep them coming back. In regards to your second question, one of the things I mentioned how uncertain the world is right now and one of the things you are trying always to do is make sure you are spending money that that could create revenue. The only issue is you pay the money upfront, person books, but because so much of the business nowadays is being done on things that are cancellable. You don\u2019t know when change happens all of a sudden money you spent it doesn\u2019t end up in the increased revenue you thought it was and your ROI is very different. So we have to look at this very carefully and we are approaching it in a cautious way. But on the other hand, we don\u2019t want to be slow to the increase in demand. That why we look at all the data very, very closely and that\u2019s about the best I can say is that, that\u2019s how we are handling it right now. We can\u2019t say anything more than because we don\u2019t know what the future is going to be quite yet.\nDavid Goulden: And then, Glenn, just to build on that\u2026\nEric Sheridan: Okay.\nDavid Goulden: Eric, just to give you a little bit more color to the answer. The deleverage you mentioned in 2021 on performance marketing is not us calling ROIs per se. It\u2019s to do with the timing that I talked about or the fact we expect to basically spend money in 2021 for lower revenue that will revenue in 2022 and that\u2019s normal is what will drive the deleverage in 2021 we talked about for performance marketing just to clarify.\nEric Sheridan: Yeah. Understood. Thanks. Thanks for all the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up we have Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn, just as travelers are coming back to the platform and some of them for the first time perhaps in several months or a year. I am just curious what you think you will see that\u2019s most significant in terms of how the product has changed or the experience has changed, is it Connected Trip or something else? And then, secondly, just wanted to get your view on some of the subscription-based programs that we are seeing across the space for travelers? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. So one of things that somebody may not have seen before and we talked about last quarter is Booking.com selling flights, for example. That\u2019s a great thing in the past we did do, now they have come back and look, they sell flights, which is a great thing. Another thing that we continue to build out our attractions area, now our people are actually buying attractions right now. We haven\u2019t stopped creating more and more places and more and more content so that when people do come back we will have attraction they can buy from us. And what they obviously would see the way we are combining things and putting things together in the way we are trying to create value for our consumers. So I think that\u2019s part of it and we are really still in the very, very early parts of this journey. But it\u2019s something that is pretty excited to be. We are going see it build out and seeing those people are buying flights and such. In regards to the subscriptions model that people are still beginning to explore as such. I don\u2019t really have a lot of comments on that. It\u2019s something that different people are doing. We will see how it plays out. David, do you, if you want to say on that?\nDavid Goulden: No. No. No further comments. We will see how they play out. I think our model the way we have it is that, is a model we think is certainly very attractive and has been successful for us, and as you say, well watch what happens in these other spaces.\nDoug Anmuth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up we have Naved Khan from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nNaved Khan: Yeah. Hi. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to ask a question on air booking. So your air tickets sold number was positive and that in this kind of environment I think it\u2019s pretty impressive. Maybe are there any insights you can share with in terms of the early results you might be seeing on integrating air tickets on your booking account side in Europe? And then the other question I had is just on the attractions and experiences. With the increases in selection that you are driving, is it mostly through partnerships or are you signing up your own direct relationships? How should we think about that?\nGlenn Fogel: So, in terms of air bookings and question on lower model at the end, so I don\u2019t cover completely. David you heard it better and fill out there. But, yes, we were pleased to see that cause number there. One of the things to point out is I just talked about little bit though in the past we didn\u2019t have air tickets coming from Booking.com and from \u2014 and also by the way our Agoda brand also sells air tickets too. KAYAK of course has been selling air ticket since the start of the company more than two decades ago. So it\u2019s easier when you add two more of our brands selling air tickets hadn\u2019t done it in the past, have a positive number. And I want to point out this is very early and these are very, very, very small numbers. So it\u2019s pleasant to see, but I wouldn\u2019t take too much except that we are on our journey. In regards to attractions for Booking.com, yes, these are coming from third-party suppliers. We are partnering with them. They give us the inventory. So we sell it. We have a commercial relationship. We are pleased that\u2019s the way to go forward. Again, one can be anything or scale and you decide which ones you want to do first, but it\u2019s a lot, you can\u2019t be everything. So it\u2019s a lot easier when you want to do a lot more things to partner with other people for things for people already set up the things you need to get. So, I am pretty pleased about that. Again, I will be more pleased when people actually are back to traveling and start buying attractions. David, I don\u2019t know if I missed anything on the air ticket [inaudible].\nDavid Goulden: I think you got it, Glenn.\nNaved Khan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next up we have Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. So, Glenn, 20% of bookings running through your own payment rails suggests that is now 70% of your merchant bookings, so it seems like you are pretty close to full adoption there. So is this primarily for alternative accommodations or flights or are you seeing that higher platform usage because of other use cases whether it\u2019s non-credit card users or otherwise? And I guess, over the coming months as you start more formally entering a recovery phase, it -- how we are going to feel like you are working at a hyper growth start up. So with that in mind, I mean you spent the last year restructuring and reducing headcount. So I wanted to get your latest thinking on whether you feel like you are properly resourced at this time or do you feel like you can spin up hiring and bump resources very quickly? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: So let me start with the second one and I will turn it over to David in terms of payments in case you want to add anything more related to that. In terms of people and we talked about this, we have been through restructuring and I think we both said in our prepared remarks how we are satisfied from where we are right now. But we also made the very important point, how much of the restructuring dealt with jobs that related to volume and that as volume comes back, we need to bring people into help cover the hopefully in a much more efficient way over time. So in terms of being a hyper start up, yeah, we -- look, we are always going incredibly hard in trying to get as much progress we count on our strategic vision, because we know that the travelers are going to come back and we want to get ahead of it as fast as we can so we can give the greatest value, the greatest -- different types of way to travel as soon as we can. I don\u2019t see any major change in 2021, but we will see how fast business comes back and we will see what happens in 2022 and we will see the rate of progress in all our strategic different things we are working on. And I will let David talk about the payments platform.\nDavid Goulden: Yeah. Payments, let me clarify, because I wasn\u2019t quite sure what you said. But let me try and clarify where we are in payments in the evolution of our payment at Booking.com. So as we said in prepared remarks, the percentage of our gross bookings process on the payment platform at Booking.com was 23% last year. That\u2019s up meaningfully from the 15% in 2019. That will mean that the vast majority of our bookings are not being processed via our payment transaction. They are still in the agency model. So we expect that payment adoption to continue to increase above the 22% this year and beyond. Payments is really super important for us for a number of reasons, because we think we can deliver benefits to our customers and our partners across all the different channels, hotels accommodations flights attractions, et cetera. It\u2019s also very important to enable merchandise usually use select honest like based in certain markets and it\u2019s also fundamental to enabling the Connected Trip where we want to have everything be able to be paid in one place. I think an update on where we all from an income statement point of view relative to the evolution of payments. I am pleased to say that the payment of Booking.com was approximately breakeven in 2020. We said in prior years we are still making some of the investment in the platform and we are focused upon still scale it out, but expect to stay in that breakeven level as we scale out and grow the payments platform from here. Obviously, with some potential minor differences year-in, year-out, we are now our breakeven situation on our payment platform should update from where we were before.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Your line is open.\nMario Lu: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two on alternate accommodations. So I believe you mentioned the segment had a healthy profit margin throughout 2019. So as we look forward to 2021 and beyond, how should we think about how quickly you can close the gap between the alternative accommodation margins compared to hotels? And secondly, you guys that you are trying to pick the single home supply in the U.S. How would you describe the strategy there, mostly investing kind of your own sales force or is it through acquisitions? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: So they actually go a little together those two questions, because one of the things I believe why we didn\u2019t have a healthy profit as you pointed out, was perhaps because we didn\u2019t have as much of it makes of the single home property, because single home does cost more for the company because you do end up with more contacts. It is just by nature. It is not as professionally run and you end up with more costs. So we do though, now that it is a product that people want and we need to have and we need to have more of it. That\u2019s absolutely correct. The briefing about this though it is a trend towards more professionalization of that single home property where the person who in the past made down onto our platform and just signed up on their own and try to orchestrate it all by themselves. What you are seeing in the industry is more and more people who want to rent out their single properties going to different people who will do it for them, who will handle all the elements of it and those people who are running these kind of we will call it channel managers, but they are like a channel managers as they are able to bring these different single property owners and put amount of this site that is able to direct debt to provide that supply to us or to somebody else. The briefing about it is these people are much more professionalized and they are more easy to deal with. They are able to understand the right things you need to do. So because of that professionalization of the industry, I believe we will be able to pick up more of the single home properties faster than we had to in the past. In regards to M&A since you know we don\u2019t comment on future M&A activity.\nMario Lu: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet from Citi. Your line is open.\nJason Bazinet: Yeah. I just had two questions. If I positive COVID is going to cause alternative to be larger than otherwise would be and cause business travel will be structurally lower than otherwise would be what is the implication for your business as we move to Connected Trip and payments in a more forceful way? Can you just, you mind just expanding on that a bit?\nGlenn Fogel: So we will go with the hypothetical, as somebody out there listen to say what I really think is happening here. So people hoops perhaps in the past never would have thought of using alternative accommodations perhaps last summer they didn\u2019t use it or they looked at it or something and now it is in a consideration set. So going forward, what has happened is now there is a much larger amount of supply for any travelers going look at and what that means is any individual supplier in the marketplace is now facing more competition. Now a distributor talked about earlier why there has been official to the distributor now. In our business which is so great because we have both a great amount of the home product that alternative accommodations and one of the largest people have the hotels. So we have this great saying where the consumer when they come, they can come to one place us and able to compare and contrast all different types, all the different prices. Understand all the different continents review is being left by previously stated. That give us a great, great benefit. So I am pleased with the way it is happening. And I -- we will go back what will have and how much will the mix be of home in the future versus hotel. I don\u2019t know any can really guess. I think over many years we have seen the trend going more and more people interested in alternative accommodations the pandemic step function up higher. I know that\u2019s not going to be a pause, maybe a dip down or continue upward, I don\u2019t know. But from my point of view, it\u2019s not that relevant in the sense that we provide both and we are going to keep getting both. So for me, I am feeling pretty good about it.\nJason Bazinet: And on the enterprise side, B2B travel?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, the -- B2B travel, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of talk about that. David, I didn\u2019t hear exactly what the question was, maybe you did.\nDavid Goulden: I didn\u2019t hear it either, so why don\u2019t you clarify the question.\nGlenn Fogel: Yeah. B2B question -- B2b question, yeah, just repeat it.\nJason Bazinet: Yeah. The question was, if COVID causes a structural shift in B2B travel, how does that influence sort of your focus on payments and focus on the Connected Trip? Is it good, is it bad, does it have no bearing sort of on your level of investment and enthusiasm around those two long-term initiatives?\nGlenn Fogel: When you say B2B travel\u2026\nJason Bazinet: Business travel. Business travel.\nGlenn Fogel: Business travel, got it. Okay. Okay. Got it. Look, I have been saying for a long time. I think that it\u2019s going to be a while before corporate travel picks up the same way leisure will pick up. It\u2019s going to be\u2026\nJason Bazinet: Yeah.\nGlenn Fogel: It\u2019s going to take longer and as a share of total travel it may never get back.\nJason Bazinet: Okay.\nGlenn Fogel: In which case, yes, eventually because businesses will continue to grow and the industry obviously people travel, eventually business travel will be larger in an absolute measure than in the past, but it may always be a smaller share. We don\u2019t really know yet, but certainly the trends are going to go that way. What that does to certain our high ADR hotels that catered to the business traveler. Do they have to make some shifts?\nJason Bazinet: Yeah.\nGlenn Fogel: Because they are not going to get those as many of those high ADR customers anymore and they need to get more leisure travelers. Well, we have a higher percentage of leisure travelers and business travelers. We are again that point where people can come and get that leisure demand. So again it\u2019s another thing what I feel good about our long future.\nJason Bazinet: Super helpful. Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. And that is all the time that we have for today. I will turn the call over back to our CEO, Mr. Glenn Fogel for any closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. So, in closing, I want to note, there it\u2019s been a little more than a year since the pandemic began and we have said we lost 500,000 mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, grandparents and so tragically children in the United States alone and globally more than 4 million lives have been lost, our hearts go out to all of them. I also want to reiterate my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Arne Sorenson, as well as to the entire Marriott organization. He left a profound mark on the travel industry and will be greatly missed. And it is so sad he will not see the recovery in the industry that he dedicated his life to and the travel industry will recover, and we are working so very hard to bring travel back as fast as we can. So I want to end by giving one last thank you to our partners, our customers and most of all to our dedicated employees who throughout the horrible year of 2020 rose to the challenge, met it and got us to where we are today, well positioned for a better tomorrow. Thank you. Please be safe. Good night.\nOperator: Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our operating results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we have seen so far in the first quarter and then discuss our expectations for 2021 and our longer term operating model. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates for 2020 and 2021 are relative to comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now onto the results for the fourth quarter. On our November earnings call, we discussed the trends we saw throughout the third quarter and into early November, including the year-on-year decline in reported room nights worsening from about 43% in the third quarter to about 58% in October and then further deteriorating to about 70% over the seven-day leading up to our November earnings call, driven by rising COVID case counts, and many European countries and governments beginning to respond with imposition of travel restrictions. As a reminder, reported room nights include the impact of cancellations. The worsening trends we saw in early November, improved a little resulting in our reported room nights declining 60% for the full quarter. November proved to be the low point for the quarter. The decline in room night growth rates versus Q3 were driven by Europe, where growth rate declined quite considerably. Looking across the other regions North America were similar to Q3 and Asia and the rest of world both improved compared to Q3. North America was the strongest region in Q4 with significantly lower year-on-year earlier decline in room nights than the other regions. Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps continued to gain share in the fourth quarter and represented over two-thirds of our total room nights in Q4 and about two-thirds of 2020. We continue to see -- we also continue to see growth in 50% of our total room nights come to us through the direct channel. Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q4, up significantly versus 2019, which was just below 50%. Our cancellation rates continue to be up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and also increased versus Q3. We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com customer booking behavior. The mix of customers booking alternative accommodations in Q4 was slightly lower than Q4 2019, while the full year was up slightly versus 2019. The slight decline in the overall mix of alternative accommodations in Q4 was due to the underperformance of the European region, which is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. The mix of alternative accommodations continued to increase year-over-year within Europe in Q4. Booking.com's alternative accommodations represented about 30% of its reported room nights for the full year 2020. The booking with the contracted versus 2019 in the fourth quarter are about the same rate as we saw in the third quarter as customers continue to focus mainly on the short-term travel needs. Gross bookings declined 65% in Q4, which is a great decline in reported room nights, due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter of $1.2 billion and decreased 63% year-over-year. As we expected, revenue in the quarter was less negatively impact than gross bookings due to the fact that revenue benefited from check-ins in Q4 from bookings received in the relatively strong third quarter. Our full year revenue was also significantly less impacted than our gross bookings driven by the differences in the timing between fees and revenue, which is recognized as check-in primarily related to 2019 bookings that check-in, in Q1 2020. As a result of these coming factors, our full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 19.2%, which is significantly higher than the 15.6% in 2019 and 2018. If our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in 2020 been in line with 2019, revenue would have been more than $1 billion lower for the full year. The difference between 15.6% and 19.2% is almost entirely explained by this timing difference. The 63% reduction in revenue resulted in adjusted EBITDA loss of $38 million in the fourth quarter. While we significantly reduced our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q4. As Glenn mentioned, we have almost entirely completed our restructuring actions, reduced personnel expenses to align our cost structure with the new demand environments. The savings recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions was about $70 million in Q4 and about $110 million for the full year. We recorded charges of $74 million and $149 million related to these actions in the restructuring and other exit cost line for Q4 and the full year respectively. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line decreased 61% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environments. Sales and other expenses decreased 45% year-over-year, primarily due to a reduction in expenses associated with payments transactions, partially offset by a mix shift in customer service to outsourced call centers. Personnel expenses decreased 13% year-over-year, primarily due to restructuring actions I mentioned previously. G&A expenses decreased 36% year-over-year, largely driven by reduced discretionary expense in such areas as T&E, lower indirect taxes and lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter due to investments in software license fees related to cyber security and privacy software. Finally, we have broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L and I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $23 million in the quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 42% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impact of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings, as well as the geographical distribution of earnings and losses. Our Q4 non-GAAP tax rate was driven by change in our full year tax provision following better than expected pretax results in the fourth quarter. On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $153 million in Q4. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $165 million in the quarter, as the benefit from an unrealized $553 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investment in Meituan was offset by income tax expenses of $410 million, $98 million of interest expense and $61 million of FX re-measurement losses on our euro bond. We excluded the unrealized gains and the re-measurement losses from our non-GAAP results. The $410 million of income tax expenses is primarily due to the discrete tax expense related to the Meituan unrealized gain and the change in our full year tax provision, following better than expected results in the fourth quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate of 90% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 18% due to the reasons mentioned from non-GAAP tax rate with the non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, driving an additional significant impact. Now onto our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance decreased to $14.8 billion from our September ending balance of $14.9 billion due to an operating cash outflow largely offset by the unrealized gains on our long-term investments. We had a $557 million operating cash outflow in the quarter driven primarily by changes in working capital, which represented a use of cash of about $400 million in the quarter, as well as a net loss recorded in the quarter. The change in working capital driven by seasonal effects were amplified by the slowdown in bookings from Q3. We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic and consistent with our comments last quarter, we have halted repurchases of our stock and will not initiate repurchase until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. Now on to our thoughts for the first quarter and to remind you we will make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of the recovery for travel, which means we are unable to provide detailed guidance at this time. January room night declines were slightly worse in Q4, driven by the increasing spread of COVID-19, including the new strains with associated additional travel restrictions. However, starting in middle of January, we saw an improvement in room night declines driven by domestic travel bookings in most part of the world and we have seen this improvement continue into February. In recent weeks, some regions have improved back to positive domestic room night growth. While difficult to predict with accuracy, if the domestic room night trends continued to improve, Q1 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. To give you a snapshot of what we are seeing recently room night declines of last seven days were about 50%, In Q1, the overall booking window is contracted versus 2019, although to a lesser extent that we saw in the fourth quarter. In Western Europe in January, we saw an expansion of the booking window versus 2019 and we have seen this expansion continue into February as the share of further out bookings including those for summer travel has increased. As Glenn noted in Western Europe, particularly in the U.K. and Germany we have recently seen stronger summer booking trends relative to what we are seeing globally and in these countries gross bookings for the summer period are 25% of where they were at the same time in 2019. These stronger booking trends in Western Europe are currently being offset by weaker near-term booking trends in the region due to extensive travel restrictions and we remind you that the significant majority of the summer bookings are cancellable. We are also encouraged to see that some countries are making notable progress in vaccinations including Israel, UAE and the U.K. We are confident that when vaccinations are broadly available and when travel restrictions are lifted people will return to travel. We saw this happen recently in Israel where vaccination rates are the highest in the world and after the national lockdown within Israel was eased on February 7th, we quickly saw domestic bookings return to solid double-digit growth versus the same period in 2019. Turning to the income statement, as I said, we expect Q1 room nights declines could be a few percentage points better than Q4. We expect Q1 gross bookings to decline a few percentage points more than room nights due to continued pressure on local currency ADRs. We expect Q1 revenue to decline slightly more than gross bookings assuming bookings continue to improve for the rest of the quarter. We expect marketing expense in Q1 will decline at the same level as gross bookings. We expect sales and other expenses in Q1 will be similar to what they were in Q4 on a dollar basis with some variability based upon where Q1 volumes land. We expect personnel expenses in Q1 where we saw higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased SBC expenses and seasonal increase in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to the restructuring actions we have taken. We expect that almost a full run rate from our personnel restructurings will be realized in Q1. We expect G&A expenses in Q1 will be about the same as it were in Q4 on a dollar basis. We expect that IT expenses will be higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, primarily due to increased investments in security, data privacy and some operational system enhancements. We currently estimate the remaining restructuring charge related to actions of Booking.com will be about $40 million and we expect to record more than half of these remaining charges in the first quarter. About half of the $40 million related to personnel related actions and the other half relates to real estate. Given what we just explained and to remind you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest revenue quarter, we expect to report a greater EBITDA loss in Q1 than in Q4. For full year 2021, I want to briefly walk you through some factors that we expect will impact our topline operating margins for the year. We expect the environment of travel to improve during 2021, but the shape and timing of that recovery remains uncertain. We expect occupancy rates to remain below where they were pre-COVID putting continued negative pressure on ADRs, which will result in our gross bookings being lower than our room nights. As I alluded earlier, our revenue was less negatively impacted than our gross bookings in 2020 due to timing factors, which benefited our 2020 revenue by more $1 billion. The opposite dynamic will happen when we experience acceleration in bookings, which will lead to our gross bookings recovering faster than revenue. Said another way, if we see this acceleration in 2021 there will be more bookings made in 2021 that will check-in in 2022 than there were bookings made in 2020 that check-in in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, but exactly how meaningful this impact will be depends upon how quickly our room nights and gross bookings accelerate in 2021. Due to these differences and the timing of bookings versus check-in, we also expect deleverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our marketing expenses at the time of booking. The most significant expense items in sales and other are payment processing costs and outsourced customer service expenses. We expect sales and other to be lower in 2021 than in 2019. The reduction will be smaller than the reduction in revenue. A few comments to help you think about our less variable expenses to 2021 and how they will most likely compare with 2019. We expect G&A to be down double digits versus 2019 driven by T&E, office and occupancy expenses, with some variability from GST taxes if new ones are enacted during the year. Personnel expenses are likely to be quite similar to 2019 on a dollar basis. To help you understand this better, there are a few factors that contribute towards this. Our personnel expense run rate immediately before COVID hit was about $200 million higher than 2019 actual personnel expenses. Less than half of this was the annualization of people expense we added during 2019 and the rest was from people expense added to the business in the first quarter of 2020. Our restructuring actions will reduce headcount expenses by approximately $370 million. So an impact of these two together will be to reduce personnel expenses by $170 million versus 2019. As we continue to invest in the business, we expect 2021 year-end headcount to be a little higher than at the end of 2020 with a mix shift towards product and technical positions. This will add about $100 million in personnel expenses in 2021. And finally SBC is expected to be higher than 2019 due to due to a few factors including the modification of some stock awards in Q1 2021 and the issuance of stock options in 2020. Finally, IT expenses in 2021 will be higher than in 2019 due to investments in security, privacy and operational system enhancements as reported to our Connected Trip strategy. As we think beyond 2021, we are looking forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings that we had prior to COVID. We will also focus on the potential for higher growth and market share. We continue to believe it will be years and not quarters before travel returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. And when considering the shape of the business at that time, I'd like to draw your attention to two factors. The first is a mix shift within the business. The continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other connected verticals will add revenue and EBITDA but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations. Payments will add to revenue with offsetting expenses in sales and other plus some additional personnel and other expenses. Flights and other connected verticals will add to bookings and revenue but at lower take rates on accommodations and will also require added personnel and other expenses as these business scales. The second is personnel. The restructuring actions we took in 2020 were mainly in volume related functions including customer service and credit collection. This means that as volumes grow beyond the levels we expect in 2021, we will need to add expenses back to business. As we mentioned before, we look to do this in cost efficient ways but the work will come back. We think it's important to include this consideration when thinking about the future shape of the business. As Glenn said, we expect to continue to have industry leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely at levels below those in 2019. In conclusion, we remain focused on what we can control and continue to execute against our strategic priorities. We are now more confident than ever that through these actions we will emerge from this crisis in a stronger position. We will now take your questions, and Grace, I will turn it over to you to open the line for questions. Yeah. Why don't I take the first one and then Glenn will -- see if you want to take a start on the second one. So, on the efficiency side, we are always looking for ways to become more efficient within the business. As I mentioned, we have reduced these variable cost to the tune of about $370 million. As they come back, we will look at more efficient ways of getting that work done. The work will come back. It won't come back this year. We basically right-sized ourselves to what we think will be through 2021, but as volumes extend beyond what we think 2021 is likely to bring those costs will come back. So we will look more efficient ways to do some of those variable activities in terms of location, technology, where we do them inside or where we deploy more partner resources, et cetera. And we also Lloyd, continue to look at how we can drive efficiencies in our fixed cost part of the business. That's not been the major focus for the last 12 months. The major focus being surviving COVID, I think, we have done a good job with that. But we do continue to kind of look at our costs across our personnel base, across our real estate, across our technology portfolios, across things like procurement, where we can continue to drive efficiencies within the business. So when we get to a more normalized environment that's something else we can also take a look at driving as well. Kevin, as I said, everything is over two years number. We do... ... everything I gave you because that way you can you make a direct comparison with how things are doing relative to how they are doing in Q4 continues with this trend line. You can do the math yourself to figure what you meant on a year-on-year basis... ... your number. We gave you regional flavor not color. That is typically based upon where the customer is located. It's a book region view. And then, Glenn, just to build on that... Eric, just to give you a little bit more color to the answer. The deleverage you mentioned in 2021 on performance marketing is not us calling ROIs per se. It's to do with the timing that I talked about or the fact we expect to basically spend money in 2021 for lower revenue that will revenue in 2022 and that's normal is what will drive the deleverage in 2021 we talked about for performance marketing just to clarify. No. No. No further comments. We will see how they play out. I think our model the way we have it is that, is a model we think is certainly very attractive and has been successful for us, and as you say, well watch what happens in these other spaces. I think you got it, Glenn. Yeah. Payments, let me clarify, because I wasn't quite sure what you said. But let me try and clarify where we are in payments in the evolution of our payment at Booking.com. So as we said in prepared remarks, the percentage of our gross bookings process on the payment platform at Booking.com was 23% last year. That's up meaningfully from the 15% in 2019. That will mean that the vast majority of our bookings are not being processed via our payment transaction. They are still in the agency model. So we expect that payment adoption to continue to increase above the 22% this year and beyond. Payments is really super important for us for a number of reasons, because we think we can deliver benefits to our customers and our partners across all the different channels, hotels accommodations flights attractions, et cetera. It's also very important to enable merchandise usually use select honest like based in certain markets and it's also fundamental to enabling the Connected Trip where we want to have everything be able to be paid in one place. I think an update on where we all from an income statement point of view relative to the evolution of payments. I am pleased to say that the payment of Booking.com was approximately breakeven in 2020. We said in prior years we are still making some of the investment in the platform and we are focused upon still scale it out, but expect to stay in that breakeven level as we scale out and grow the payments platform from here. Obviously, with some potential minor differences year-in, year-out, we are now our breakeven situation on our payment platform should update from where we were before. I didn't hear it either, so why don't you clarify the question."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings' fourth quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Despite a travel environment that continues to be very challenging, we closed out 2020 by delivering fourth quarter results that were a bit better than the expectations we talked about on our last earnings call. David will provide the details on the fourth quarter results in his remarks. For my time, I will first briefly reflect on our execution during the extremely difficult year of 2020. Then I will share our thoughts and strategic priorities for 2021 and beyond. Without a doubt 2020 presented the biggest disruption to modern global travel the world has ever seen and our results for full year 2020 were down substantially from 2019. However, travelers still book 355 million room nights through our platforms during 2020 and we remain profitable by generating approximately $880 million in adjusted EBITDA. Delivering these results during this unprecedented and unpredictable year is a credit to our team's relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and to our supply partners while all the time remaining incredibly focused on operating efficiently. When we spoke to you on our earnings call in May of 2020, we outlined a series of plans that would help us navigate through the COVID-19 crisis. First, we said we would stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis. Second, we said we would optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. And third, we said we would position the business to be able to capture travel demand when it returns. Based on our accomplishments in 2020, I can confidently say that we executed well against these plans. In the beginning of the crisis, we successfully stabilized the business by taking several immediate steps including, quickly closing offices and smoothly transitioning to a distributed work environment to protect the health and safety of our employees, which was and continues to be a top priority, working closely with travelers and supply partners to process the unprecedented level of travel changes and cancellations, and bolstering liquidity and preserving cash by holding stock buybacks cutting non-essential costs and raising over $4 billion in capital through a debt offering. And we began the process and have almost entirely completed our work to optimize the business for the decrease in travel demand through the restructuring actions we have taken at each of our brands across the company. As a result of these actions, our 2020 year end headcount decreased approximately 23% versus 2019, primarily in volume-related position. We expect these reductions to result in annualized cost savings of about $370 million in personnel expenses with about $110 million of savings recognized in 2020. All our work is never done in terms of finding opportunities for cost efficiencies. We believe the headcount reductions needed to optimize the business for the current demand environment are now generally behind us. Finally, we believe we have positioned the business well for when travel demand returns. We continue to make progress against our key strategic priorities during 2020 and this progress has continued as we have moved into 2021. We remain active in performance marketing channels, and are being agile and adapting our approach to this very uncertain environment, and we will leverage our learnings from the past year to continue to capture demand in these performance channels at appropriate ROIs. In addition, our marketing team has been working hard to develop campaigns and messaging that we will deploy when we believe the time is right to encourage people to travel once again and use our services. As we think ahead about 2021, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the exact shape and timing of the recovery for travel. The rate of recovery will depend heavily on the rate of new COVID-19 cases, including new potentially more transmissible and more dangerous variants and on the timing of effective and broad based vaccine distribution, which we believe will be a key step in helping people feel safe to travel again. We are tracking early signs of encouraging summer booking trends in Western Europe, primarily the U.K. and Germany, relative to what we are seeing globally. Although in each case, gross booking levels are still below where we were at the same point in time in 2019. While seeing green shoots of a summer booking season positive, it's uncertain whether these trends will continue and whether we will see this summer booking strength expand into other countries and regions, and of course, whether these advanced will turn into stayed room nights, or will be canceled. What would be most helpful will be continued government action around the world to accelerate vaccine distribution, while providing direct and indirect support to the entire travel and hospitality industry. Additionally, international travel remains extremely depressed and recovery will not be possible until government restrictions on international travel are lifted or modified to travelers who can show they are safe travelers are allowed to travel freely. As you know, our International business has been a great advantage for us historically and we expect it will be in the future, but we anticipate this to be a longer recovery. We know that people have a very strong desire to travel. We saw this first hand in 2020 when we witnessed a strong improvement in our booking trends from the lows of April through the peak summer travel season, driven in part by pent-up demand as people came out of lockdowns. The travel that was booked last year was much more domestic-oriented than in prior years as many people adapted to the restricted travel environment and still found a way to take a trip. With many travel restrictions now in place around the world, we believe there is once again a high level of pent-up demand for travel. But when this demand will be fully unlocked is of course difficult to predict and it will depend on vaccination rates and other factors. While the trending of the pickup in travel demand is beyond our control, we are focused on things we can control, primarily better positioning our business by continuing to invest and execute against our key strategic priorities including, expanding the payment platform at Booking.com, building out our Connected Trip capabilities and growing our market share in the United States. Our integrated payment platform at Booking.com provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. It is strategically important as it enables merchandising capabilities that we haven't had access to historically at Booking.com, but we expect to utilize selectively in the future to help drive growth. In addition, this payment platform is foundational for enabling our Connected Trip strategy. We continue to make progress expanding the payment platform with approximately 22% of Booking.com's gross bookings in 2020 processed on the platform. This was up from approximately 15% in 2019 and was less than 4% back in 2017. So this is a dramatic shift in our large-scale business. We are optimistic about recent improvements in our Booking.com U.S. payment platform, which will enable increased utilization of payments in this critical market. We expect to see a higher percentage of Booking.com's gross bookings processed on the payment platform in 2021 as compared to 2020 and expect these increases to continue beyond 2021. Our Connected Trip vision is a multi-parted offering including accommodations, flights, ground transportation and attractions in dining connected by our seamless payment network and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence to provide a frictionless experience for our bookers all the way from the initial booking to experiencing their trip. We are building towards this vision, because we believe that Connected Trip will drive increased loyalty and frequency and will enhance the growth of our accommodation business to additional customer acquisition and merchandising opportunities. Developing a robust flight product at Booking.com remains an important strategic component of the Connected Trip, as it gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other products to those bookers. In the coming years, we expect flights will represent an increasing mix of our overall business, which will help drive incremental revenue and EBITDA dollars. As mentioned in the past growing our share of the U.S. travel market remains a key strategic priority for our company as the U.S. is one of the largest travel markets in the world and we have historically under indexed there. We are taking several steps to increase our competitiveness in the U.S. market and are focused on making sure we are offering great value to our customers, improving our payments platform to enable bundling and merchandising opportunities, increasing overall consumer awareness of our Booking.com through marketing and expanding our alternative accommodation supply. While we have built a large and competitive alternative accommodations business globally, we believe we have a significant opportunity for improvement in the United States, which will involved, product improvements, supply acquisition and raising consumer awareness of this type of inventory on Booking.com. The key to invest and execute against these three strategic priorities as when we capture demand as travel recovers will be our focus in 2021. We believe successful implementation of these priorities is key to achieve higher growth rates, increasing market share and eventually building a larger business with higher earnings than we had prior to COVID. We expect this larger business to have a higher mix of merchant transactions and non-accommodation products, both of which will negatively impact our EBITDA margin rates. But we expect to continue to lead the travel industry in this metric. Finally, I want to address the European Commission's initial proposal from the Digital Marketing Act and Digital Services Act released in December. The European Commission has proposed regulations and to keeping markets fair and open, which is an ambition that we support. However, at the present time, it is not known for certain what the ultimate rules will be, how they might be applied or what the impact will be on us and other market participants. We are engaged with state service to work towards regulations to tackle the legitimate problems of the large gatekeepers in the digital community of which we believe we are not one. We will update you in the area during future calls. In conclusion, there are still tough days ahead of us and everyone in the travel industry. COVID case counts remain high and the wider global distribution of vaccines is still too slow. However, I am more confident than ever in our long-term future and we will at some point see a strong recovery in travel demand. I firmly believe that our company is very well-positioned to capture this demand as it comes back. In the meantime, we will focus on what we can control, namely investing in our business and executing against our strategic priorities to ensure we exit this crisis on a strong footage, which will enable us to build a larger and faster growing business over the long run. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. And Lloyd. Your question is good one because we continue to see changes not only by companies like Apple making changes, you just mentioned, but Google doing differences and government certainly talking about laws and regulations about cookies and all sorts of things that impact different ways that people do marketing, in particular performance marketing and different things and that can impact companies, certainly in the short-term and we are all just looking and trying to evaluate what do we think this will mean for any one of these things. But the thing I am really focused on is that change can also be good. We believe that we have some of the best marketing people in the world in terms of digital marketing. So when changes happen we can make adjustments, we can make changes, we can do things faster and better and we have so much data to test with that we believe we can actually come out of these things sometimes better off than we were in the past. So right now, there is nothing I can say in terms of impact or not. It took us so far as to say we have been adapting and changing as the world of digital marketing has been changing for 20 years and we have kept on top of it and so I am so confident that we will be able to make any adjustments we need to make for the future. Sure. So in regards to the whole alternative accommodations, we would like to call it in Europe. I don't think we talk much about regional exact share and I am not going to here. But I certainly, we talked a little bit how Europe is our stronghold in that area. We are better there in the home area, other areas. But throughout the world I think I can say to you that we are better in things that are less single property. We always want to increase the single property, because we know that's an area where we can improve upon. So that is an issue right now and with the pandemic there certainly was a bit of a shift for some people that they wanted to be isolated away from other people. So certainly, there was more demand than the past for the single home area. That showed much more in the U.S. for us than Europe because Europe we do have a greater amount of our home supply is single property than say in the U.S. Look, it's an area where we to continue to focus on and I do believe right now in the environment there is, that is a great product to have up on the shelf. That being said, in the future, we will see how much that maintains or things go back more towards they used to be where there is a different split between homes and hotels. In regard to your second question about relationship with hotel suppliers, obviously, we are doing everything we can to help our partners. The next come up with new ways to come up with promotions that they want to do, telling them what we think their spots of demand that they can come up with give and take a closed user group prices they can help get the more demand, coming out with ways they can put together things in content in terms of safety and health so that a traveler who looks on our sites, sees their hotel and sees that is a safe place to go, do all different things with them to try and improve their business. It's very difficult right now, as you know because let's face it, unless we see a demand, if you can have the greatest content in the world where people don't trying to travel, they are not going to travel. But we are going to continue to do that. I do believe in terms of relationships, certainly, as a distributor, when there is less demand we are more valuable as a partner to them. And the time when there is very, very high occupancy rates, any hotels I don't need the distributor nearly as much, but when they don't have as much occupancy rate then they start looking for demand and we have the benefit of being the largest platform for hotel demand in the world. So we are in a place for them to come and get some more of that incremental demand and we are continuing to work with them to make sure they do their best to get it. Well, let me start with the first one, Kevin. We absolutely have begun to focus more on the U.S. It's always been a priority. So don't get me wrong in that area. But certainly we have made a couple of changes. We are focusing more specifically in the U.S. As we scale the company over many, many years we had a very global presence and we try not to make changes solely for any particular market, really believing that scaling the business we have it and the same was the best way to achieve a very, very large global share of the business. That being said, we have come to a state where we recognize that we continue to be under indexed in the U.S. and maybe we need to make some changes there, which we are doing and I think that we will make some progress in that. In terms of whether we are going to do a brand or in terms of performance marketing, I am not going to give away the playbook here. I will say though, we are absolutely doing the things I talked about in my prepared remarks in terms of obviously we do want to increase awareness, we obviously want to increase the total amount of supply, increase our alternative accommodation, doing all the things that are necessary to make sure we are getting the share of the business that we believe we should be getting. Yeah. So, Eric, loyalty is an important thing because it really talks about something that we talk about a lot is bringing people home direct to us and we have talked about this numerous times of how we believe getting people to come back to us directly is a critical part of the strategy going forward. And certainly one of the ways we do that is by providing our loyalty version, which is our genius plan at Booking.com which really does we believe give some real value to consumers and that's something that we are going to continue on. Because in the end it costs an awful lot of money as we hope to get a new customer. It's cheaper to keep them. So we are going to keep on doing all the things we can to keep people coming back direct. And you are right about first-party, it could be third-party and all these different ways that we worry about how we are going to get through to the come in the future, certainly important to get new customers, but also real important to keep them coming back. In regards to your second question, one of the things I mentioned how uncertain the world is right now and one of the things you are trying always to do is make sure you are spending money that that could create revenue. The only issue is you pay the money upfront, person books, but because so much of the business nowadays is being done on things that are cancellable. You don't know when change happens all of a sudden money you spent it doesn't end up in the increased revenue you thought it was and your ROI is very different. So we have to look at this very carefully and we are approaching it in a cautious way. But on the other hand, we don't want to be slow to the increase in demand. That why we look at all the data very, very closely and that's about the best I can say is that, that's how we are handling it right now. We can't say anything more than because we don't know what the future is going to be quite yet. Sure. So one of things that somebody may not have seen before and we talked about last quarter is Booking.com selling flights, for example. That's a great thing in the past we did do, now they have come back and look, they sell flights, which is a great thing. Another thing that we continue to build out our attractions area, now our people are actually buying attractions right now. We haven't stopped creating more and more places and more and more content so that when people do come back we will have attraction they can buy from us. And what they obviously would see the way we are combining things and putting things together in the way we are trying to create value for our consumers. So I think that's part of it and we are really still in the very, very early parts of this journey. But it's something that is pretty excited to be. We are going see it build out and seeing those people are buying flights and such. In regards to the subscriptions model that people are still beginning to explore as such. I don't really have a lot of comments on that. It's something that different people are doing. We will see how it plays out. David, do you, if you want to say on that? So, in terms of air bookings and question on lower model at the end, so I don't cover completely. David you heard it better and fill out there. But, yes, we were pleased to see that cause number there. One of the things to point out is I just talked about little bit though in the past we didn't have air tickets coming from Booking.com and from \u2014 and also by the way our Agoda brand also sells air tickets too. KAYAK of course has been selling air ticket since the start of the company more than two decades ago. So it's easier when you add two more of our brands selling air tickets hadn't done it in the past, have a positive number. And I want to point out this is very early and these are very, very, very small numbers. So it's pleasant to see, but I wouldn't take too much except that we are on our journey. In regards to attractions for Booking.com, yes, these are coming from third-party suppliers. We are partnering with them. They give us the inventory. So we sell it. We have a commercial relationship. We are pleased that's the way to go forward. Again, one can be anything or scale and you decide which ones you want to do first, but it's a lot, you can't be everything. So it's a lot easier when you want to do a lot more things to partner with other people for things for people already set up the things you need to get. So, I am pretty pleased about that. Again, I will be more pleased when people actually are back to traveling and start buying attractions. David, I don't know if I missed anything on the air ticket [inaudible]. So let me start with the second one and I will turn it over to David in terms of payments in case you want to add anything more related to that. In terms of people and we talked about this, we have been through restructuring and I think we both said in our prepared remarks how we are satisfied from where we are right now. But we also made the very important point, how much of the restructuring dealt with jobs that related to volume and that as volume comes back, we need to bring people into help cover the hopefully in a much more efficient way over time. So in terms of being a hyper start up, yeah, we -- look, we are always going incredibly hard in trying to get as much progress we count on our strategic vision, because we know that the travelers are going to come back and we want to get ahead of it as fast as we can so we can give the greatest value, the greatest -- different types of way to travel as soon as we can. I don't see any major change in 2021, but we will see how fast business comes back and we will see what happens in 2022 and we will see the rate of progress in all our strategic different things we are working on. And I will let David talk about the payments platform. So they actually go a little together those two questions, because one of the things I believe why we didn't have a healthy profit as you pointed out, was perhaps because we didn't have as much of it makes of the single home property, because single home does cost more for the company because you do end up with more contacts. It is just by nature. It is not as professionally run and you end up with more costs. So we do though, now that it is a product that people want and we need to have and we need to have more of it. That's absolutely correct. The briefing about this though it is a trend towards more professionalization of that single home property where the person who in the past made down onto our platform and just signed up on their own and try to orchestrate it all by themselves. What you are seeing in the industry is more and more people who want to rent out their single properties going to different people who will do it for them, who will handle all the elements of it and those people who are running these kind of we will call it channel managers, but they are like a channel managers as they are able to bring these different single property owners and put amount of this site that is able to direct debt to provide that supply to us or to somebody else. The briefing about it is these people are much more professionalized and they are more easy to deal with. They are able to understand the right things you need to do. So because of that professionalization of the industry, I believe we will be able to pick up more of the single home properties faster than we had to in the past. In regards to M&A since you know we don't comment on future M&A activity. So we will go with the hypothetical, as somebody out there listen to say what I really think is happening here. So people hoops perhaps in the past never would have thought of using alternative accommodations perhaps last summer they didn't use it or they looked at it or something and now it is in a consideration set. So going forward, what has happened is now there is a much larger amount of supply for any travelers going look at and what that means is any individual supplier in the marketplace is now facing more competition. Now a distributor talked about earlier why there has been official to the distributor now. In our business which is so great because we have both a great amount of the home product that alternative accommodations and one of the largest people have the hotels. So we have this great saying where the consumer when they come, they can come to one place us and able to compare and contrast all different types, all the different prices. Understand all the different continents review is being left by previously stated. That give us a great, great benefit. So I am pleased with the way it is happening. And I -- we will go back what will have and how much will the mix be of home in the future versus hotel. I don't know any can really guess. I think over many years we have seen the trend going more and more people interested in alternative accommodations the pandemic step function up higher. I know that's not going to be a pause, maybe a dip down or continue upward, I don't know. But from my point of view, it's not that relevant in the sense that we provide both and we are going to keep getting both. So for me, I am feeling pretty good about it. Well, the -- B2B travel, I don't think there's a lot of talk about that. David, I didn't hear exactly what the question was, maybe you did. Yeah. B2B question -- B2b question, yeah, just repeat it. When you say B2B travel... Business travel, got it. Okay. Okay. Got it. Look, I have been saying for a long time. I think that it's going to be a while before corporate travel picks up the same way leisure will pick up. It's going to be... It's going to take longer and as a share of total travel it may never get back. In which case, yes, eventually because businesses will continue to grow and the industry obviously people travel, eventually business travel will be larger in an absolute measure than in the past, but it may always be a smaller share. We don't really know yet, but certainly the trends are going to go that way. What that does to certain our high ADR hotels that catered to the business traveler. Do they have to make some shifts? Because they are not going to get those as many of those high ADR customers anymore and they need to get more leisure travelers. Well, we have a higher percentage of leisure travelers and business travelers. We are again that point where people can come and get that leisure demand. So again it's another thing what I feel good about our long future. Okay. Thank you. So, in closing, I want to note, there it's been a little more than a year since the pandemic began and we have said we lost 500,000 mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters, grandparents and so tragically children in the United States alone and globally more than 4 million lives have been lost, our hearts go out to all of them. I also want to reiterate my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Arne Sorenson, as well as to the entire Marriott organization. He left a profound mark on the travel industry and will be greatly missed. And it is so sad he will not see the recovery in the industry that he dedicated his life to and the travel industry will recover, and we are working so very hard to bring travel back as fast as we can. So I want to end by giving one last thank you to our partners, our customers and most of all to our dedicated employees who throughout the horrible year of 2020 rose to the challenge, met it and got us to where we are today, well positioned for a better tomorrow. Thank you. Please be safe. Good night."

And now, I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. While the impact of COVID-19 continues to weigh heavily on our results, we were pleased to see a sequential improvement in trends in our third quarter, which is our seasonally largest, and by far, most profitable quarter. The reported room nights, which includes the impact of cancellations, were down 43% year-over-year in the third quarter, which was a marked improvement from the 87% decrease we experienced in the second quarter. Continued pressure on ADRs in the quarter slightly offset by 1 point FX benefit, led gross bookings and revenue decline by about 4 percentage points more than room nights.  We recorded approximately $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, which was an improvement from the $376 million loss we reported in Q2, but this was 60% lower than in the third quarter last year.  As our results show, we are operating significantly below pre-COVID levels. However, we were encouraged by an improvement versus the second quarter, and we're pleased to see travelers and supply partners connecting through our platforms as they emerge from this spring's first wave of coronavirus infections. Delivering these results in what continues to be an extremely challenging and unpredictable environment is a credit to our team's relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and supply partners.  The improvement in booking trends in the third quarter versus the second quarter was almost entirely driven by domestic travel with a very modest improvement in international travel. As we noted last quarter, our domestic business is benefiting from government restrictions on international travel, which forces consumers who want to travel they have to do it domestically. We believe the improvements in trends we've seen in this challenging environment demonstrate people's deep desire to find a way to travel with Q3 results benefiting from some pent-up demand after the lockdowns in Q2. Looking more closely to the shape of the quarter, the year-over-year decline in reportedly nights was relatively consistent each month of Q3 as the steady improvement in global trends that we saw from April through July flattened out in August and September. In October, reported room nights declined by about 58% compared to October 2019, and over the last seven days through yesterday, declined by about 70%.  We believe this worsening result is driven by increased virus infections and certain governments reimposing public health related restrictions. We believe that travel will continue to be greatly affected by infection trends and governments\u2019 public health responses. David will provide some more color on the regions in his remarks. As we think about the full fourth quarter, it's difficult to predict exactly what the next two months will look like in terms of travel demand, as we enter the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere amid rising COVID case counts in many areas. Given the trends we're currently seeing, we believe that year-over-year room night decline to be greater in Q4 than what we observed in October. If this turns out to be the case, it will be a very challenging for us to reach profitability in Q4. Despite the expected challenging fall and winter ahead of us, I remain confident in the long-term outlook for both our industry and our company. I strongly believe that people have an innate desire to travel, which will ultimately drive a recovery out of this crisis. When we think about the timing and shape of this recovery, we continue to believe that a key milestone will be a widely distributed vaccine or effective treatment, which will give people confidence that it is safe to travel. While we're encouraged by the news of progress being made on this front, we understand it will take time to produce and distribute any vaccine on a global basis to achieve effectiveness. I'm also encouraged to see some governments such as Japan and Thailand taking concrete incentives to incentivize travel. More programs like these and increased cooperative action from governments around the world would help accelerate the travel recovery. One of the progress we're seeing leaves me optimistic on the long-term outlook for our industry. I continue to recognize there'll likely be years and not quarters before the travel market returns to pre-COVID volumes. In the meantime, we continue to execute against a series of plans to navigate the company through these challenging times, and lay the important groundwork that will set us up to emerge from the pandemic in a position of strength. As we previously discussed, we've assessed our total cost structure, and developed plans to align it with expected market demand over the next few quarters. This work is complete at KAYAK, OpenTable, Agoda and Priceline. And we started to see some of the associated $80 million of annual cost savings [paid] in during the third quarter. We are making progress with our initiatives to reduce the workforce at Booking.com by up to approximately 25% with an associated annualized savings estimated between $250 million to $300 million. We've been taking restructuring action at Booking.com in various countries. And in some countries, we've implemented voluntary labor schemes. We are continuing to work with our works councils, employee representatives and other organizations to finalize plans in other countries. It is our hope to make the vast majority of the announcements to employees about these personnel reductions by the end of 2020. It's important to stress that these personnel restructuring decisions are difficult, and we do not take them lightly. Given the expected timeframe of the recovery that we have discussed, we believe that our restructuring plans are the correct actions for the company in order to right size the business.  In addition to our cost reduction actions, we remain focused on positioning the business to capture more travel demand as it develops during recovery and over the long-term. Part of this effort is continuing to build towards our long-term vision of the connected trips, seamless multi-product offering, which we believe will ultimately improve the customer experience on our platform, and drive enhanced loyalty and frequency over time.  In addition, we believe offering other travel products will provide opportunities through merchandising and customer acquisition to enhance the growth of our core accommodation business. Booking.com is continuing to take important early steps to build a flight product, and recently announced the launch of flights on Booking.com in the U.S. We see flights as a key component of the connected trip. It is an obvious opportunity for us to remove friction in the booking process for our customers. The connected trip vision of providing this frictionless customer experience we brought together by a seamless payment network, which we continue to develop and extend to more of our supply partners. We strongly believe that developing these payment capabilities has valuable benefits for both our bookers and supply partners, including potentially lower payment costs for our suppliers. Also, we will continue to work closely with our supply partners to help them respond to this environment, and more effectively market their properties on our platform in order to capture more travel demand as it returns over time. Finally, let me address the matter that we are following closely and that many of you may have questions about. The European Commission is working on a new regulatory framework for the digital economy, which, among other things, proposes to designate some large online companies who operate across Europe as gatekeepers and to establish rules and regulations for these businesses. The criteria for being a gatekeeper and the associated rules and regulations are in development. So the potential impact is difficult to estimate at this time. There have been questions and speculations that Booking.com maybe one of the designated gatekeepers, which we firmly believe would be incorrect for a number of reasons. The principal reason is that the accommodations market in Europe is very open and very competitive. Consumers have multiple online and offline choices to book accommodations and accommodation providers have multiple online and offline channels for our customers.  To put this into perspective, Booking.com booked about 7% of all potentially bookable accommodation room nights across all properties on our platform globally in 2019. Across Europe, that number was about 11%. As I mentioned, a new European regulatory framework is under development, and we will update you on developments during future calls. In conclusion, we believe we are responding well to this pandemic crisis. We are providing great service to our customers and are working with our supply partners so that together we can get them as much business as possible during these difficult days. I think it\u2019s been clearly sad that we had to let go and are still in the process of letting go so many dedicated hard working people. But it is a necessary step. And we expect to have some challenging quarters ahead of us. As I said before, we believe it will take years for travel to fully recover. However, I am confident in our team's ability to execute during these unprecedented times and continue to deliver value to our traveler customers and supply partners alike and to emerge from this crisis on a strong footing.  I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\nDavid Goulden : Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our operating results for the third quarter and provide some color on the trends we saw through the quarter and into October. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.  Now on to our results for the quarter. On our last earnings call in August, we discussed the trends that we saw throughout the second quarter and into July, including the year-over-year decline in newly booked room nights steadily improving from about 85% in April to about 35% in July, driven by increased levels of domestic travel.  As a reminder, newly booked nights -- newly booked room nights excluded impact of cancellations. As Glenn noted, the steady improvements in global trends that we saw from April to July flattened out in August and September, resulting in our newly booked room nights declining about 37% for the full quarter. Our Q3 reported room night, which included the impact of cancellations, decreased 43% for the full quarter, which is worse than our newly booked room night decline in the quarter as the cancellation rates remained above prior year levels. This improvement in room night declines versus Q2 was helped by pent-up demand from lockdowns and other travel restrictions earlier in the year. At a regional level, we saw North America continue to improve as we moved throughout the third quarter. However, this improvement was offset by softening trends in Europe. Room night declines in Asia were consistent throughout Q3. Unfortunately, as we moved into September, we saw COVID case counts climbing higher in many European countries, and governments beginning to respond with imposition of travel restrictions. This difficult pattern continued throughout the month of October, leading to a further slowdown in bookings in Europe. In October, we also saw a slowdown in North America, while the room night declines in Asia remained consistent with Q3. And as a result, global newly booked room nights through October were down about 50% year-over-year, and reported room nights for October were down about 58%. Over the last 7 days through yesterday, these trends have further deteriorated with newly booked room nights declining about 58% year-over-year and reported room nights declining about 70% year-on-year. This is the global average, and in Europe, these decline rates are much higher. These recent trends are a reminder that this is a fragile recovery and that we're now seeing a second dip in our business driven by COVID. We believe that the recent increase in COVID cases in Europe and the U.S., coupled with cold weather and travel restrictions in these geographies, will result -- will likely result in the second dip being U-shaped and lasting until the early spring of 2021. Domestic room nights represented over 70% of our newly booked room nights in both Q3 and in October, up significantly versus 2019, which was about 45%. After growing year-on-year in the third quarter, our newly booked domestic room night reverted back to a year-over-year decline in October. Booking.com's domestic alternative accommodation newly booked room nights also decreased year-over-year in October after increasing nicely in the third quarter. Our October reported room night decline, which includes the impact of cancellations, was worse than our newly booked room night decline in the month as the cancellation rates remained above prior year levels. Although we saw continued improvement in the cancellation rate through the third quarter, this trend also reversed course in October. Given the recent high COVID case counts and increased travel restrictions, we expect to see further pressure on cancellation rates for the remainder of the fourth quarter, especially considering the percentage of our recent bookings that are being made with flexible cancellation policies that remains higher than the prior year. We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. In Q3, we continued to see an increase in the mix of customers booking alternative accommodations versus the prior year levels. However, as we progressed through the quarter and into October, we saw this increase in the alternative accommodation share moderate. Booking.com's alternative accommodations represented approximately one-third of all new bookings in the quarter. We've also seen the length of the booking window contract in the third quarter after expanding versus the prior year in the second quarter as customers made a higher share of bookings in both quarters to stay in the peak summer period. The booking window continued to shrink versus last year in October as customers focused on their short-term travel needs.  Mobile bookings, particularly through our app, continued to gain share in the third quarter and October. And finally, we continue to see greater than 50% of our newly booked room nights coming to us through direct channel. Gross bookings declined 47% in Q3, which is a greater decline than reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 8% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As a point of comparison, on newly booked room night ADRs, excluding the impact of cancellations, declined year-over-year by only a couple of percentage points in Q3. An increasing mix of bookings in higher ADR markets like Western Europe and the U.S. helped offset -- wide offset the pressure of the broader lodging industry ADR declines. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $2.6 billion and decreased 48% year-over-year, about in line with the gross booking decline. Adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion in Q3 was down 60% year-on-year. And while we significantly reduced our variable cost lines like marketing and sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased, to a lesser extent, in Q3. As Glenn mentioned, we continued our actions in the quarter to reduce operating expenses as we optimized and aligned our cost structure with the new demand environment. However, for 2020, we expect the savings recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions will be more than offset by charges reported in the restructuring and other exit costs line. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 48% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel environment. We expect our marketing expense to remain significantly below 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. Sales and other expenses decreased 53% year-over-year primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions, a reduction in the provision for bad debt and credit losses as we saw an improvement in our collection rates relative to our prior expectations as well as lower outsourced customer service costs as we needed less support in processing reduced transaction volumes. We expect sales and other expenses will continue to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. However, the extent of this decline will be impacted by the level of volume we see in the business. Personnel expenses decreased 9% year-over-year primarily due to lower bonus accruals and reduced headcount. The restructuring actions we completed at Agoda, KAYAK OpenTable and Priceline benefited the personnel expenses by approximately $20 million in the third quarter. Additionally, personnel expenses benefited from $22 million in government aid packages primarily related to programs we were already participating in within the Netherlands and the UK. Currently, we do not anticipate further material benefits to personnel expenses from government aid in future quarters, and we expect that personnel expenses in the fourth quarter will decline about the same as it did in the third quarter. G&A expenses decreased 34% year-over-year largely driven by reduced discretionary expenses such as T&E and other personnel-related expenses, lower indirect taxes as well as lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. We expect that G&A will continue to be down meaningfully year-over-year in the fourth quarter, about in line with the decline we saw in the third quarter. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year. We expect that IT expenses will be up slightly versus the prior year in the fourth quarter. Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L. The $41 million in restructuring charge we recorded in the third quarter primarily relates to rightsizing activities at Booking.com. I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. With respect to Booking.com, in September, we initiated the first wave of restructuring actions in over 40 countries, which did not include the UK and the Netherlands, where Booking.com continues to consolidate its works councils and employee representatives. We currently estimate that the remaining restructuring charge related to actions at Booking.com will be approximately $100 million, some of which we expect to record in the fourth quarter and the rest into early 2021. At this time, and subject to our consultation with the Dutch Works Council, employee representatives and other organizations, we currently estimate that these collective cost reductions plus attrition at Booking.com could impact up to about 25% of the global workforce and could produce annualized run rate personnel savings between $250 million and $300 million, which we expect to be almost fully phased-in in the second quarter of 2021. Again, these estimates may change, and we'll update you in the coming months. It's our hope to make the vast major of announcements to employees affected by these personnel reductions by the end of 2020. Our non-GAAP EPS was $12.27, down 73% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 41%, which is significantly higher than Q3 last year due to the impact of disproportionate non-deductible expenses, including SBC relative to a low projected full year pre-tax earnings estimates. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $315 million in Q3 as our GAAP operating expenses in the quarter included a charge of $573 million related to an impairment of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK. This non-cash impairment charge is driven by reduced financial projections and a longer expected recovery for KAYAK and OpenTable due to COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded GAAP net income of $801 million in the quarter as we benefited from an unrealized $730 million pre-tax gain on our equity investments primarily related to our investment in Meituan. In addition, we recorded a $64 million pre-tax expense in the quarter related to our French and Italian tax matters. There was also $117 million of FX remeasurement losses on our euro bonds. We excluded the impairments to tax expense, the unrealized gains and the remeasurement losses from our non-GAAP results. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash and investments balance increased to $14.9 billion while June ending balance was $13.4 billion due to positive operating cash flow as well as the unrealized gain on our long-term investments. We generated $920 million of operating cash flow and $848 million of free cash flow in the quarter, both down approximately 50% versus the prior year. Change in working capital represented a use of cash of about $300 million in the quarter driven by seasonal effects and the impact this had in the third quarter due to a high concentration of check-ins, which resulted in an increase in our accounts receivable balance. We'll continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our comments last quarter, we've halted repurchase of our stock and will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. Now on to our thoughts for the fourth quarter. Consistent with our approach last quarter, I will not provide full quarterly guidance, but instead, we'll provide you some additional color from our preliminary October results, which will help give you a better sense of our recent top line trends. As I mentioned earlier, our newly booked room nights and reported room nights in October declined year-over-year about 50% and 58%, respectively, and at higher rates in the last week. Room night declines for the fourth quarter will likely vary from October's results, especially considering the recent rise of COVID-19 cases and imposition of travel restrictions and the impact that will have on the level of travel demand and cancellations in November and December. We expect the room night declines in November, December will be worse than they were in October. We expect gross bookings in the fourth quarter will decline year-over-year by several percentage points more than our reported room nights due to negative pressure on local currency ADRs, and we expect that revenue declines in the quarter will be several percentage points less than the decline in gross bookings primarily due to book to stay timing differences similar to what we saw during the first wave of the pandemic. Given our expectations for further reductions in room night growth from October, coupled with continued ADR pressures, we expect it will be very challenging to reach a positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter.  On a more positive note, if we compare our internal outlook for the full year 2020 now with where we were when we spoke to you in August, we're ahead on all major income statement and cash flow metrics. In conclusion, as Glenn emphasized, we are quite pleased with our third quarter results in a challenging environment. And while we expect the fourth quarter to be an even more difficult environment, we have confidence that we will continue to execute against what we can control. We made some difficult decisions and taken a number of actions that will help us optimize the business. We have confidence that through these actions, we'll emerge from the crisis in a stronger position.  We'll now take your questions. So Laura, can you please open the line for Q&A?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question will come from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.\nAlex Wang : This is Alex Wang on for Brian. First, can you just -- I appreciate all the details on alternative accommodation. But can you give us a sense of how that business is doing globally sort of year-to-date? And what do you see as the main sort of investment priorities for that business, whether it may be supply or branding? And then second, I appreciate all the comments on the Booking.com launch of flights in the U.S. Maybe talk to us a little bit what you're seeing in early tests or any early learnings? And any other areas where you might want to expand to in the U.S., whether maybe packages or you talked about payments as well?\nGlenn Fogel : Sure, Alex. It's Glenn speaking. Why don't I take -- we'll go in reverse order. I'm going to talk around flights, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the alternative accommodation strategy and where we're going, and then I'll let Dave if he wants to talk to you about what you want in terms of year-to-date. So talking about the things we're doing with flights. We just started it for Booking.com in the States. So it's very, very, very early. But as I've always talked about this connected trip vision, flights is a very important part of it. Many people start with flights. So we believe that it's going to be an important way to get more customers into our funnel and see all the great offerings we have. Now payments is a very important part of our overall connected trip because, one thing, if you want to offer up, for example, a package, as you discussed, which we do want to offer at -- when we get to it, you have to have a payment platform. You've got to be able to do that because you can't combine into at one price, if you're not willing to able to take all the money from the customer upfront and then distribute to the different suppliers. That's the way to do it. So these things are very important to us, and it's early, but I am pleased to see us up and running. And later on, we'll be able to come back to you, hopefully, with some numbers and give you some -- in the future, some idea of how it's doing. Regarding alternative accommodation, it's clearly an important part of the business. We talked about it last quarter, how, many people in the second quarter went for alternate accommodations when you compare it back to the 2019 numbers because for the reasons that we talked about in terms of safety, people wanting to feel that they were weren't a big crowd, a lot of the issues we talked about last time. That's important around the world. And we've always talked about how important it is to offer up to our customers every single type of accommodation they may want. And we know by having more selection, that improves the proposition to the consumer. So we're continuing to do that. Now I've also talked about how, particularly in certain geographies like the U.S., we were not getting as much of the inventory as we should have and that we know is needed in certain types of alternative accommodations, primarily the individual home unit, and we continue to build that out, too, because we know people want that one, too. So strategy is to continue to build that out and make sure that we're offering the customer what they want, when they want it.  And David, I don't know if you want to give anything in terms of this question about year-to-date.\nDavid Goulden : Yes. I can provide a little extra color, Glenn, and Alex, in response to the question. Perhaps it\u2019s just the best way to talk about things in the third quarter because the USA numbers are really skewed pretty much by what's happened so far this year in Q1 and Q2. So just to remind you, we have over [6.5 million] listings in the alternative space. We mentioned that we saw a growth in Q3 in our domestic business. And to give a little bit more context around that, within the domestic business, alternative accommodations grew low double-digits, whereas the rest of the business or the core business grew low single-digits. So that kind of gives you a spread for how they did relative to each other in the third quarter. The area we saw the biggest improvements in alternative accommodations growth vis-\u00e0-vis what we saw in the second quarter was in Europe, just another data point.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman : I was hoping if you could just dig into the trends and the situation a little bit in Europe that you described from the past week. Can you just kind of walk us through how far along we are in the process of the countries kind of locking down or shutting down, maybe compare that to April and what's going on in the business, specifically in Europe, just so we understand how far along we are in that process? That would be reflected in those numbers you gave us.\nGlenn Fogel : Sure. Thank you, Kevin, for the question. It's obviously a very hard thing to answer because none of us are actually in the governmental meetings that are making these decisions on what to do in terms of lockdowns, how strict to be, when you're going to say you're going to open it up and they're making those projections now and they could very easily change. And people are even changing what they say week-to-week, day-to-day. And we see each day there's a new pronouncement by a new government. What we can say, though, is when these restrictions are put up, we do get cancellations right away, of course, for people who are planning to travel to certain regions. And that, obviously, is going to impact our as-booked room nights.  Certainly, people also say, \"Hey, I'm not going to make a new booking. I was going to make that new booking. I'm not going to do it because either, A, I'm not going to be able to travel there; or B, I'm concerned that, that area is going to be restricted or where I'm leaving from could be restricted.\" Now compared to April, though, I think there's a sense that I've gotten some thoughts about from some of the people who are involved in talking to our public affairs field, talking to governments, et cetera, is that they're trying to do it in a more selective way. Everybody knows the impact on the economies that a full lockdown, complete lockdown can do. So the governments are doing their best to try and not do complete lockdowns. But travel is always something that is immediately looked at as a potential increase in infections because people come from different regions. So I feel that we are still going to have a lot of disruption due to these very, very steep increasing infection rates. And I can't give you anything more than that. I don't know -- unless David, do you have anything you'd want to add?\nDavid Goulden : I just want to add, I think you said it upfront, Glenn, but just to be clear that right now, the declines that we're seeing in Europe, they're obviously worse than the global average numbers I gave you, but they're not as deep as we were back in April, just to be clear. But we do see the shape of things being a little different as well. We think -- we obviously saw -- witnessed April was much more of a deep V in terms of the shape of the first wave as those -- the shock back in the long-term bookings that were on the book got canceled. We believe that we're going into more of a U-shaped trend environment for the rest of the winter, what we hopefully is deep. But of course, the winter months are also a factor because in the North Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, it's much harder to travel to warm weather without getting on a plane. So the substitution effect we saw in the third quarter from international to domestic are probably going to be less in the winter months than we were able to enjoy in the third quarter. There are a few factors going on. But just to reinforce, it is worse than the average, but not quite yet as bad as we were in April.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. \nChris Kuntarich: This is Chris on for Lloyd. You guys have made some comments earlier on about performance marketing as well as cancellation rates starting to step up. Could you just talk a little bit about your ability to deploy performance marketing dollars in 4Q as those cancellation rates step up? How should we think about kind of balancing that with the shorter booking windows as well? And then just specific to the U-shaped recovery that you guys are talking about, are you making any vaccine or any additional assumptions? I know, David, you just kind of walked through some of them, but anything else we should think about there?\nGlenn Fogel : So Chris, on the performance marketing, you're smart to point out the fact that cancellations is going to impact the ROI significantly. So when we start seeing virus rates going up, we are immediately taking action that we don't want to be paying for a whole bunch of clicks that are not going to end up in revenue. Even if they end up in a booking, the booking gets canceled and you end up how you spent the money for nothing. So absolutely, there's a direct relationship. And as virus rates go up, as restrictions follow up in terms of restricting travel, we are immediately readjusting our expectation in terms of our performance marketing. So that is absolutely correct. In terms of the yield, we have not made any call in terms of when a vaccine is going to be declared effective and safe, nor how long it will take to be distributed or not. I think everybody, though, has read all the news about these things. I don't think anybody is expecting a large distribution or global distribution anytime soon, so certainly not nearly in the first quarter. So we're not based on our decisions on that at all. We are hopeful, though, that we've seen what happened in the spring, and we saw government actions did help, and we saw what happened in the summer. There was that rebound, pent-up demand. So we're hopeful. And David, you made the curve. So you can explain further on how we came up with what we are -- why we're doing what we're doing.\nDavid Goulden : Well, I think, Glenn, you summarized it well. But I think that we just believe that there won't be much change in the environment in Europe and maybe in North America through the winter months. We believe that, hopefully, that when we get to the early spreading, that might be coupled with more progress towards a vaccine or vaccines. We're not making a call on when one is going to become available, as Glenn said, but hopefully, there'll be better news. But also there'll be better weather and people thinking about the spring and the ability to travel again and the prospects of warmer climates, warm weather to come. And we expect that will hopefully be kind of the slope up on the U. We are optimistic that when we see the recovery, it will be a strong recovery in the spring, as I think we saw it was in the summer this year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS. \nEric Sheridan : Maybe I can broaden out the question on advertising. Glenn, how far are you in terms of what you want to accomplish over the medium to long-term in realigning your marketing channels and making sure you're maximizing for ROI? And maybe if you could just give us a little bit of color on some of the payments, while it's a low end demand environment that you might be sort of testing and learning and thinking about in terms of realigning for some of the outcomes you're looking for in a multi-year view? And maybe just a little bit additional color on some of the direct mobile booking activity you're seeing, that's quite promising for the long-term.\nGlenn Fogel : Sure. So in terms of the long-term view of marketing, so as you all know, we built our company based on performance marketing. We also know, though, that we need to increase awareness in certain geographies, and we've always talked about being able to do that with -- from a brand perspective. One of the things that we just tested out and is very small, very small in the States, a digital brand campaign. You may have seen it, America is For Everybody. And we did it on a digital base. That was a digital brand effect to see how that would do. You may have seen the print version in the New York Times, not very digital but having an actual printed thing, but very low cost, and we thought it's very important to get that out, really what our values are as a company and what we stand for.  But it certainly is important that we get that awareness out there, 2 areas where we are, let's say, that we are under-indexing like the States. And we'll continue to do that as demand comes back, coming up with the different ways and always testing. We're always testing and digitally, you can do it better in terms of figuring out what your ROI is or not. Of course, the most important thing for us always is providing great service, and all the things we talked about, the great price, the great selection, the great customer service. If we can get the loyalty, people come back directly, instead always having to pay all that money for marketing to get people to come back. Get people to come directly is really the ultimate goal, of course. In terms of mobile, David, why don't you want to take that one, if you want to give anything further in terms of where that is?\nDavid Goulden : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. No additional hard data points to provide now. But just to give you a little color, obviously, we said several quarters ago, we were over 50% mobile, and that's continued to increase in a positive direction. And we are pleased with the fact that the app, it continues to be a very major part of the mobile business but also increasing in line with the growth in mobile. So at the appropriate time, we'll give you a few more data points on that. But we're not quite ready to break those out today, but they are trending positively. And to Glenn's point, particularly with the app, not just as a place where we can get more direct business, but also a place where, essentially, the customer trip -- the customer connected trip will actually live and we can interact not just during the booking process but also during the trip as well in a very real way. We can also deliver the multi-product capabilities. That is super important. So we're pleased to see that move in the right direction.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.\nDae Lee : This is Dae on for Doug. I have two. First one is that given your strategy of having all property types in the single platform, can you get an update on the work that you guys are doing to surface the right property type to the right traveler at the right time? And how are you messaging the travelers who have certain property types in mind? And then my second question is on -- what's your view on overall competitive environment right now. Are you seeing that competition is holding up better or worse than previously expected through these challenging times?\nGlenn Fogel : So let me take the second one. I'll let David take the first one. I didn't hear it so well. In terms of the overall competitive market, the travel business has always been extremely competitive. And whether there's a terrible lack of demand because of a pandemic, or it's boom times, back -- just -- it's hard to believe, but just a year ago or so, the competition continues to exist. And in fact, it's interesting because the European Commission, the regulators who are talking about that potential new regulations coming out, interestingly, they put out a report only a few weeks ago. And in the report, it\u2019s mentioned, in fact, that online travel is considered a fiercely competitive market. So clearly, regulators recognize that, too. And I don't think it's changed at all in terms of the fact that there's a lot less demand than there used to be. I think it's always competitive and always will be. Yes, David, the first part?\nDavid Goulden : I'm sorry. Back to the first question, just kind of how we match property type to travel. I mean, that really is what our business is all about. And you could see property type to travel or travel to property type. And obviously, we do that very dynamically. So we're, of course, using machine learning and artificial intelligence. The more you visited our sites or site, the more we know about you. Therefore, we're going to optimize our results to your search to kind of match your prior needs and behavior. But of course, more recently for both the traveler and the accommodation, we'd be focused much more upon the domestic market opportunities, letting our suppliers make themselves available and attractive to our travelers. If you spent any time on our site recently, particularly Booking.com, you'll see that there's extensive information that the properties can put in now about what they've done across a number of dimensions to handle safety and health during the pandemic. So it's absolutely kind of just a core premise of how the business operates that we intelligently do that mapping and matching.  Now of course, because we have the benefit of having a very, very broad range of both traditional hotels and alternative accommodations on the same platform, we can let people filter, search, compare side-by-side on a very comparable basis. And we think that provides a unique value to a lot of our customers. But as you would expect, we've been optimizing and modifying that quite a lot. And if you search for something this time this year and compare it to this time last year because of the pandemic, you get very different priority results coming back to you.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. .\nJustin Post : Your main competitor is talking about some pretty big cost savings that they're going to be able to achieve when you look out. I'm just wondering if you can give us -- looking to the other side, how you're thinking about margins. I know in '19, your EBITDA margins were high 30s. But do you think this is an opportunity for the whole industry to get more profitable? And would you think about your margins being higher when you get back to kind of those levels of bookings?\nGlenn Fogel : David, why don't you take that in terms of our long-term thoughts about margin?\nDavid Goulden : Yes. Sure, Justin. Let me give you a couple of thoughts here. So first of all, we expect our business to have very attractive, and continue to have industry-leading margins when demand fully returns. There'll be a couple of puts and takes. So for example, as we build into new products like air, those will be dilutive to the margin rates, but obviously, healthy margin dollars and important to our business and strategy. And things like payments, again, will be diluted to the margin rate, but will contribute margin dollars. You have to take that into account in thinking about the long-term future. But as I said, we expect to have industry-leading margins in the long-term. Between now and when we get back to full recovery, there'll be some puts and takes. Obviously, for example, as we grow rapidly, as we expect to over the next few years, as the industry recovers, we will incur marketing expenses related to our bookings prior to those bookings turning into revenue. So during those periods of reacceleration, there'll be some downward pressure on our operating margins as we kind of build that book of business again. As I said, in the long-term, we expect to be very well positioned.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Just wondering if you could talk about more recent trends you're seeing in Europe. And I apologize, I'm sure you covered this part on the call, but if you could just repeat it now or provide any more color, especially in the wake of the recent lockdowns, is that already -- do you know is that already having a shift in how people are traveling? And have you seen this kind of sustained shift over to alternative accommodations, I guess, across the business? Is that something that you think may lead to almost a semi-permanent change in consumer behavior, just a much greater willingness to embrace alternative accommodations than they were pre-COVID that's happened during the crisis, but do you think there's a reason to think that, that will be kind of a permanent condition, kind of a modest shift over there?\nGlenn Fogel : Hi, Mark. So as I talked a little earlier about this certainly in the prepared remarks, we've seen a significant drop and talked about the last 7 days. Things move very quickly. Changes happen very rapidly when governments make changes in terms of ability to travel, restrictions in terms of going to restaurants, non-essential shops being closed. These things make immediate impact on people. In fact, I haven't actually tried it this time, but you can watch on our systems. You can watch an announcement go out and very, very quickly. You can see the impact towards cancellations or drops in bookings for future stays. So there's an incredible correlation between that. In terms of alternative accommodations, my thoughts -- it's interesting, the beginning of the crisis, I wasn't sure which way this might go because on the one hand, I thought that people would want to not be in a crowded hotel and risk getting infected or going to elevator. And so therefore, they would want an alternative combination where they could be separate from people, but I also recognize that people may be wanting industrial strength, disinfecting of rooms and professionalized treatment of the entire place. So maybe you go for hotels.  Clearly, we've seen the statistics very early in the Q2 area where we saw that significant increase in share shift to alternative accommodations for us than we've seen in Q3. It's not as much. I do believe that the trend that has been going on for a very long time of more and more people contemplating and then using the alternative accommodations, I think that trend has just been accelerated. In fact, it brought forward what would have happened perhaps on a year or 2 years or whatever in the future because now people did try this. And now I do believe that there is a continuous shift once you've tried it. And if you like it, you're going to put it in your consideration set for the future.  Now of course, when we talked about our share of alternative accommodations in total, when there's -- let's say -- let\u2019s go to even Q2 when it was a big number, 40%. Well, that meant 60% of the new bookings were for hotels. Hotels are still a really popular way to stay, and they will always be. That's one of the things that's great about our platform because we offer both. We offer the most of both. And that is something that is a winning combination for our customers. When they come on, we know from the data that many people who come on to our site, they're not sure yet where they want to stay. And they're looking at a lot of different types of accommodations. By offering them all the different types of accommodations, that makes us a winner in terms of getting them to book it with us. And I think that's going to be what we're going to keep going forward.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. \nStephen Ju: Okay. So Glenn, digging in a little bit on the flexibility you called out, given what consumers went through during March and April, with trying to cancel trips and getting refunds and -- are your users choosing to go for the higher-priced cancellation-enabled option? Because I would imagine -- and I would imagine having cancellations with your hotel partners is probably a little bit more seamless versus the alternative accommodation. So is there any new work you think you might need to do to prepare your supply partners for what might be the new consumer normal of elevated cancellations?\nGlenn Fogel : Yes. So there is a tremendous shift into people wanting to have the free cancellation option. There's no doubt about that. And it's understandable. There's also -- we see in the booking window, people booking much, much closer into when they're going to actually arrive with their accommodation. Again, both of these things making perfect sense of what's going on around the world right now. And how long that will continue for? It's uncertain. But there was a crisis in the beginning of the year for everyone who had done a non-refundable accommodation. But then what happened is you had countries that were shutting down travel and the issue became, well, now the person can\u2019t go there. It was nonrefundable, but it's a force majeure situation. Do they get their money back? And if so, from who? Who's going to give it? The hotels aren't even around to actually give the money back, many of them, et cetera. And I will make the point of how proud I am of the customer -- our customer service team doing with all those people desperate to get their money back at the same time having to deal with the suppliers saying -- who would say, \"Listen, we're closed. We don't even have access to the money. We can't return it.\" And I'm really pleased with the way we acted in taking the money out of our own pocket essentially and giving it to those consumers who need that money now. They need it now; they can't wait. In doing that, I'm just so proud of our teams that did that and really made things better. Now it's much -- or many months after that, now if you book a non-refundable accommodation, even if there is a close-down by a government, you're not getting your money back because everybody is aware of the situation. Every -- your eyes are wide open when you buy that nonrefundable, you're not going to get that money back. And so people aren't pretty much behind the refundable one. I do expect though over time that will go back because of the benefit of getting a better price. David, do you want to give any comments on this at all, that I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d say?\nDavid Goulden : No, I think you covered the major areas, Glenn. Obviously, we are -- as we enter, euphemistically, the second wave -- we were in -- all were into lockdown in the first, including customers and ourselves and our partners. There'll be some differences. Glenn talked about the force majeure which is obviously important. Typically, there are fewer bookings that are on the books right now because we're operating at much lower levels than we were back in the January, February time before everything hit. So that will also -- we do some of the extra workload that we have been on customer service, although we expect there to be some. And as I mentioned, we've seen customers, particularly recently favoring the more flexible cancellation policies, which, of course, isn\u2019t everybody's practice and that also -- has also had a slight leaning towards the agency product where the cancellation options are all flexible. So we're going into it eyes open. I'm sure there are going to be some things we haven't foreseen that come along. But I think it will be quite different in terms of how we'll be able to deal with this vis-\u00e0-vis the \"all hands on deck\" situation back in April and May.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays.\nDeepak Mathivanan : Glenn, I know it's early and things are volatile in the second wave right now. But any reason to not think that the demand during peak of the second wave will be better than what you saw in April and May? There are government restrictions, but consumers obviously have found some ways to travel safely and then restrictions are also somewhat measured and probably shorter now. Just obviously, vaccine will be ideal, but curious how to think about consumer behavior changes in the second wave versus the first outbreak?\nGlenn Fogel : Deepak, I think that certainly, what you're saying could be the case, and I think it's hard to say, and as David said, we're not expecting to hit the lows of April yet. But I'll point out there are counter facts, too, such as, as we're entering the spring and into the summer, it was getting warmer. It was getting lighter in the Northern Hemisphere and you could travel locally and have a nice holiday away from wherever you were. If you were in a city that was suffering significant infection rates, and you just wanted to get out, it was easy to say, we\u2019re going to drive or get my car and drive not so far away and it's pleasant, I can go outside, maybe near a beach, maybe near a lake, whenever, let's take a little holiday, okay? Not so great in the middle of the winter in the dark. So that's kind of a factor. Who knows? I think the right way to think about this stuff is not think about right now, second wave, next couple of months. I think the important thing is to think about the long term. And that's what we continue to put our focus on, is making sure that we're coming up with our systems, our products, our services, working with our suppliers so we have everything set up right when that demand comes back for real in the way we know it will because all pandemics do end; they do. Whether there is a vaccine or not, and we hope there'll be one soon, and all the news says they'll be one relatively soon. But even if not, even not a vaccine a pandemic will end, people will start traveling again. And we will, I believe, have that very wonderful rebound and come out of this crisis.\nDeepak Mathivanan : Got it. And then second question on alternative accommodations, if I may. Can you elaborate on what type of use cases is driving the alternative accommodations growth? Clearly, like you said, there's domestic and there's drive-in. But in the marketplace, it seems like there's appetite for longer-term stays now. Are you seeing a broader use case expansion under alternative accommodations as well?\nGlenn Fogel : Well, there's definitely a widened use case because we're operating in a very, very different world right now. I haven't done any research. We have not done the research to really nail down how many people decided, I want to use an alternative accommodation because I cannot live in just a one-room apartment in the city for the next month. I need to get out in a bigger space in the country. I don't know how many of you did that. Where people said, I'm working from home, and I live in a studio, I need another place. I can't do that; where a family that say, the kids are going crazy. We got to get out of this place and go there. So there are a lot of alternative uses of the alternative accommodations that never existed before. And that could very well have driven that up. I think in the long run, though, again, people having experienced this, now it goes into the consideration set for any type of use, standard holiday or not. And that's why I do believe, in the long run, continue to build our inventory for the single property type use is very important.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Lee Horowitz from Evercore ISI.\nLee Horowitz : Two if I could. One, just on the U.S. in the third quarter. Can you speak at all to any market share shifts you're seeing in the U.S. market and how you may be thinking about using the COVID disruption and obviously your strong balance sheet and operating structure to perhaps lean into this depressed demand environment to pick up share in some markets where maybe you've been underrepresented? And then second, on the cost-cutting guidance on the 250 million to 300 million, my understanding is one that, obviously, a lot of that is variable in nature and coming down with the overall travel demand environment, but that some of it could perhaps be permanent. I guess is there any way to contextualize how you were thinking about perhaps some of the permanent cost savings that may be associated coming out of that, whether that's digitizing of customer relationship management or things of that nature? Anything that could be helpful on the permanent nature of some of those once we get back to, say, 2019 levels?\nGlenn Fogel : So why don't I take a little bit of the first part of the U.S. and then, David, you can say anything you want to add to that and then talk about the cost cutting. So absolutely, I've said many times that we are under-indexed in the U.S., and that's a great opportunity for us. That's a case where we have the capability of adding to our future growth by doing better things in the U.S.  In terms of how to do it, in terms of -- you mentioned the balance sheet, how much is lean, et cetera, right now, there's not a tremendous amount of demand right now for doing anything. So the idea of putting together a big brand campaign or just to make them more awareness right now, we're just trying to lean into performance marketing, that to me is not a good use of money. We've always said that we want to be frugal in the way we try and get more customers and how we build our brand et cetera, want to do it the right way. So obviously, I mentioned already about getting more supply for a certain type of alternative accommodation in properties, that's absolutely something that we are doing and going and doing that. And it's also coming up and putting and investing in flight in the U.S. I mentioned that one already, and I mentioned now down the road, we'll have packages. So building on that and building out payments, which are so important for all different reasons. We can go into why that's an important thing and making sure we have that set up right in the U.S. and we have lots of our hotel partners onto the payment network.  So all those things are investments, and that is what we are doing. But what we're not going to do is go out and do a giant, giant brand campaign where literally nobody is listening to that right now in this winter. And we're not going to do it that way. David, do you want to add anything?\nDavid Goulden : Yes, I do. Thanks, Glenn. Just to -- relative to the U.S. in the third quarter, when we look across the major markets, the U.S. was by far the strongest of the major markets for us from a performance point of view. The decline rates there were lower than the average and lower than any of our other territories. So we're not talking market share, but just to give you something directional to think about in terms of how the business performed. And then, Lee, on the cost side, yes, you're right, there's $250 million to $300 million of expense reductions annualized from Booking.com. There's also $80 million from the other brands as well. So please don't go that piece as well. You're right. Most of those related to volume-related functions in the business, things like customer service, so credit collection partner search. It's not entirely but largely functions like that which are tied to volume. So as volumes come back, as we expect to do over the next few years, we obviously need to replace that cost base. So we're looking at all sorts of alternatives, including how much more technology can we deploy in those areas as we would do normally.  The cost savings that we're not talking about right now are because we're in the middle of a crisis and we've got our hands full. We've getting the volume cost aspects out of the business. Already operating efficiencies in the business in other areas beyond what we're doing now, that's not the immediate focus. It's something we can take and to look at once we get beyond the crisis and we start to see a recovery. Of course, we've been running a fairly efficient business in the first place. We're not sitting with a large amount of excess fixed costs to optimize, but there's always opportunity.  And if you recall, we started talking about some of those things a little bit before the coronavirus hit in the spring of this year. So we'll come back to those in the fullness of time. And we'll also look to make sure that as we continue to drive efficiencies in the business that we don't bring back all the costs that had to -- lead the business as the business returns to prior volumes.\nOperator: And that will be for your last question. I would now like to hand the call over back to Mr. Fogel for closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel : Thank you. So the first thing I want to do, I just want to say thank you once again to all of our employees who have been working so hard to help our partners and customers in these very difficult times. And of course, I absolutely want to thank our customers who choose from the many available options to book their travel through us. And finally, I have to thank all of our supplier partners who continue to work closely with us as we try and get through this crisis. While the near term will definitely be challenging I remain confident in our long-term value proposition, and we are focused on the steps we have to take today to create a better company tomorrow. Please be safe, and good night.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And again, thank you so much presenters. Thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe, and have a lovely day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our operating results for the third quarter and provide some color on the trends we saw through the quarter and into October. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.  Now on to our results for the quarter. On our last earnings call in August, we discussed the trends that we saw throughout the second quarter and into July, including the year-over-year decline in newly booked room nights steadily improving from about 85% in April to about 35% in July, driven by increased levels of domestic travel.  As a reminder, newly booked nights -- newly booked room nights excluded impact of cancellations. As Glenn noted, the steady improvements in global trends that we saw from April to July flattened out in August and September, resulting in our newly booked room nights declining about 37% for the full quarter. Our Q3 reported room night, which included the impact of cancellations, decreased 43% for the full quarter, which is worse than our newly booked room night decline in the quarter as the cancellation rates remained above prior year levels. This improvement in room night declines versus Q2 was helped by pent-up demand from lockdowns and other travel restrictions earlier in the year. At a regional level, we saw North America continue to improve as we moved throughout the third quarter. However, this improvement was offset by softening trends in Europe. Room night declines in Asia were consistent throughout Q3. Unfortunately, as we moved into September, we saw COVID case counts climbing higher in many European countries, and governments beginning to respond with imposition of travel restrictions. This difficult pattern continued throughout the month of October, leading to a further slowdown in bookings in Europe. In October, we also saw a slowdown in North America, while the room night declines in Asia remained consistent with Q3. And as a result, global newly booked room nights through October were down about 50% year-over-year, and reported room nights for October were down about 58%. Over the last 7 days through yesterday, these trends have further deteriorated with newly booked room nights declining about 58% year-over-year and reported room nights declining about 70% year-on-year. This is the global average, and in Europe, these decline rates are much higher. These recent trends are a reminder that this is a fragile recovery and that we're now seeing a second dip in our business driven by COVID. We believe that the recent increase in COVID cases in Europe and the U.S., coupled with cold weather and travel restrictions in these geographies, will result -- will likely result in the second dip being U-shaped and lasting until the early spring of 2021. Domestic room nights represented over 70% of our newly booked room nights in both Q3 and in October, up significantly versus 2019, which was about 45%. After growing year-on-year in the third quarter, our newly booked domestic room night reverted back to a year-over-year decline in October. Booking.com's domestic alternative accommodation newly booked room nights also decreased year-over-year in October after increasing nicely in the third quarter. Our October reported room night decline, which includes the impact of cancellations, was worse than our newly booked room night decline in the month as the cancellation rates remained above prior year levels. Although we saw continued improvement in the cancellation rate through the third quarter, this trend also reversed course in October. Given the recent high COVID case counts and increased travel restrictions, we expect to see further pressure on cancellation rates for the remainder of the fourth quarter, especially considering the percentage of our recent bookings that are being made with flexible cancellation policies that remains higher than the prior year. We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. In Q3, we continued to see an increase in the mix of customers booking alternative accommodations versus the prior year levels. However, as we progressed through the quarter and into October, we saw this increase in the alternative accommodation share moderate. Booking.com's alternative accommodations represented approximately one-third of all new bookings in the quarter. We've also seen the length of the booking window contract in the third quarter after expanding versus the prior year in the second quarter as customers made a higher share of bookings in both quarters to stay in the peak summer period. The booking window continued to shrink versus last year in October as customers focused on their short-term travel needs.  Mobile bookings, particularly through our app, continued to gain share in the third quarter and October. And finally, we continue to see greater than 50% of our newly booked room nights coming to us through direct channel. Gross bookings declined 47% in Q3, which is a greater decline than reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 8% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. As a point of comparison, on newly booked room night ADRs, excluding the impact of cancellations, declined year-over-year by only a couple of percentage points in Q3. An increasing mix of bookings in higher ADR markets like Western Europe and the U.S. helped offset -- wide offset the pressure of the broader lodging industry ADR declines. Consolidated revenue for the third quarter was $2.6 billion and decreased 48% year-over-year, about in line with the gross booking decline. Adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion in Q3 was down 60% year-on-year. And while we significantly reduced our variable cost lines like marketing and sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased, to a lesser extent, in Q3. As Glenn mentioned, we continued our actions in the quarter to reduce operating expenses as we optimized and aligned our cost structure with the new demand environment. However, for 2020, we expect the savings recognized in our personnel expense line related to these actions will be more than offset by charges reported in the restructuring and other exit costs line. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 48% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel environment. We expect our marketing expense to remain significantly below 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. Sales and other expenses decreased 53% year-over-year primarily due to reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions, a reduction in the provision for bad debt and credit losses as we saw an improvement in our collection rates relative to our prior expectations as well as lower outsourced customer service costs as we needed less support in processing reduced transaction volumes. We expect sales and other expenses will continue to be down year-over-year in the fourth quarter. However, the extent of this decline will be impacted by the level of volume we see in the business. Personnel expenses decreased 9% year-over-year primarily due to lower bonus accruals and reduced headcount. The restructuring actions we completed at Agoda, KAYAK OpenTable and Priceline benefited the personnel expenses by approximately $20 million in the third quarter. Additionally, personnel expenses benefited from $22 million in government aid packages primarily related to programs we were already participating in within the Netherlands and the UK. Currently, we do not anticipate further material benefits to personnel expenses from government aid in future quarters, and we expect that personnel expenses in the fourth quarter will decline about the same as it did in the third quarter. G&A expenses decreased 34% year-over-year largely driven by reduced discretionary expenses such as T&E and other personnel-related expenses, lower indirect taxes as well as lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. We expect that G&A will continue to be down meaningfully year-over-year in the fourth quarter, about in line with the decline we saw in the third quarter. Information technology expenses were up 1% year-over-year. We expect that IT expenses will be up slightly versus the prior year in the fourth quarter. Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in operating expenses in the P&L. The $41 million in restructuring charge we recorded in the third quarter primarily relates to rightsizing activities at Booking.com. I note that these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. With respect to Booking.com, in September, we initiated the first wave of restructuring actions in over 40 countries, which did not include the UK and the Netherlands, where Booking.com continues to consolidate its works councils and employee representatives. We currently estimate that the remaining restructuring charge related to actions at Booking.com will be approximately $100 million, some of which we expect to record in the fourth quarter and the rest into early 2021. At this time, and subject to our consultation with the Dutch Works Council, employee representatives and other organizations, we currently estimate that these collective cost reductions plus attrition at Booking.com could impact up to about 25% of the global workforce and could produce annualized run rate personnel savings between $250 million and $300 million, which we expect to be almost fully phased-in in the second quarter of 2021. Again, these estimates may change, and we'll update you in the coming months. It's our hope to make the vast major of announcements to employees affected by these personnel reductions by the end of 2020. Our non-GAAP EPS was $12.27, down 73% versus the prior year. Non-GAAP net income reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 41%, which is significantly higher than Q3 last year due to the impact of disproportionate non-deductible expenses, including SBC relative to a low projected full year pre-tax earnings estimates. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $315 million in Q3 as our GAAP operating expenses in the quarter included a charge of $573 million related to an impairment of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK. This non-cash impairment charge is driven by reduced financial projections and a longer expected recovery for KAYAK and OpenTable due to COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded GAAP net income of $801 million in the quarter as we benefited from an unrealized $730 million pre-tax gain on our equity investments primarily related to our investment in Meituan. In addition, we recorded a $64 million pre-tax expense in the quarter related to our French and Italian tax matters. There was also $117 million of FX remeasurement losses on our euro bonds. We excluded the impairments to tax expense, the unrealized gains and the remeasurement losses from our non-GAAP results. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash and investments balance increased to $14.9 billion while June ending balance was $13.4 billion due to positive operating cash flow as well as the unrealized gain on our long-term investments. We generated $920 million of operating cash flow and $848 million of free cash flow in the quarter, both down approximately 50% versus the prior year. Change in working capital represented a use of cash of about $300 million in the quarter driven by seasonal effects and the impact this had in the third quarter due to a high concentration of check-ins, which resulted in an increase in our accounts receivable balance. We'll continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our comments last quarter, we've halted repurchase of our stock and will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. Now on to our thoughts for the fourth quarter. Consistent with our approach last quarter, I will not provide full quarterly guidance, but instead, we'll provide you some additional color from our preliminary October results, which will help give you a better sense of our recent top line trends. As I mentioned earlier, our newly booked room nights and reported room nights in October declined year-over-year about 50% and 58%, respectively, and at higher rates in the last week. Room night declines for the fourth quarter will likely vary from October's results, especially considering the recent rise of COVID-19 cases and imposition of travel restrictions and the impact that will have on the level of travel demand and cancellations in November and December. We expect the room night declines in November, December will be worse than they were in October. We expect gross bookings in the fourth quarter will decline year-over-year by several percentage points more than our reported room nights due to negative pressure on local currency ADRs, and we expect that revenue declines in the quarter will be several percentage points less than the decline in gross bookings primarily due to book to stay timing differences similar to what we saw during the first wave of the pandemic. Given our expectations for further reductions in room night growth from October, coupled with continued ADR pressures, we expect it will be very challenging to reach a positive adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter.  On a more positive note, if we compare our internal outlook for the full year 2020 now with where we were when we spoke to you in August, we're ahead on all major income statement and cash flow metrics. In conclusion, as Glenn emphasized, we are quite pleased with our third quarter results in a challenging environment. And while we expect the fourth quarter to be an even more difficult environment, we have confidence that we will continue to execute against what we can control. We made some difficult decisions and taken a number of actions that will help us optimize the business. We have confidence that through these actions, we'll emerge from the crisis in a stronger position.  We'll now take your questions. So Laura, can you please open the line for Q&A? Yes. I can provide a little extra color, Glenn, and Alex, in response to the question. Perhaps it's just the best way to talk about things in the third quarter because the USA numbers are really skewed pretty much by what's happened so far this year in Q1 and Q2. So just to remind you, we have over [6.5 million] listings in the alternative space. We mentioned that we saw a growth in Q3 in our domestic business. And to give a little bit more context around that, within the domestic business, alternative accommodations grew low double-digits, whereas the rest of the business or the core business grew low single-digits. So that kind of gives you a spread for how they did relative to each other in the third quarter. The area we saw the biggest improvements in alternative accommodations growth vis-a\u0300-vis what we saw in the second quarter was in Europe, just another data point. I just want to add, I think you said it upfront, Glenn, but just to be clear that right now, the declines that we're seeing in Europe, they're obviously worse than the global average numbers I gave you, but they're not as deep as we were back in April, just to be clear. But we do see the shape of things being a little different as well. We think -- we obviously saw -- witnessed April was much more of a deep V in terms of the shape of the first wave as those -- the shock back in the long-term bookings that were on the book got canceled. We believe that we're going into more of a U-shaped trend environment for the rest of the winter, what we hopefully is deep. But of course, the winter months are also a factor because in the North Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, it's much harder to travel to warm weather without getting on a plane. So the substitution effect we saw in the third quarter from international to domestic are probably going to be less in the winter months than we were able to enjoy in the third quarter. There are a few factors going on. But just to reinforce, it is worse than the average, but not quite yet as bad as we were in April. Well, I think, Glenn, you summarized it well. But I think that we just believe that there won't be much change in the environment in Europe and maybe in North America through the winter months. We believe that, hopefully, that when we get to the early spreading, that might be coupled with more progress towards a vaccine or vaccines. We're not making a call on when one is going to become available, as Glenn said, but hopefully, there'll be better news. But also there'll be better weather and people thinking about the spring and the ability to travel again and the prospects of warmer climates, warm weather to come. And we expect that will hopefully be kind of the slope up on the U. We are optimistic that when we see the recovery, it will be a strong recovery in the spring, as I think we saw it was in the summer this year. Yes. Thanks, Glenn. No additional hard data points to provide now. But just to give you a little color, obviously, we said several quarters ago, we were over 50% mobile, and that's continued to increase in a positive direction. And we are pleased with the fact that the app, it continues to be a very major part of the mobile business but also increasing in line with the growth in mobile. So at the appropriate time, we'll give you a few more data points on that. But we're not quite ready to break those out today, but they are trending positively. And to Glenn's point, particularly with the app, not just as a place where we can get more direct business, but also a place where, essentially, the customer trip -- the customer connected trip will actually live and we can interact not just during the booking process but also during the trip as well in a very real way. We can also deliver the multi-product capabilities. That is super important. So we're pleased to see that move in the right direction. I'm sorry. Back to the first question, just kind of how we match property type to travel. I mean, that really is what our business is all about. And you could see property type to travel or travel to property type. And obviously, we do that very dynamically. So we're, of course, using machine learning and artificial intelligence. The more you visited our sites or site, the more we know about you. Therefore, we're going to optimize our results to your search to kind of match your prior needs and behavior. But of course, more recently for both the traveler and the accommodation, we'd be focused much more upon the domestic market opportunities, letting our suppliers make themselves available and attractive to our travelers. If you spent any time on our site recently, particularly Booking.com, you'll see that there's extensive information that the properties can put in now about what they've done across a number of dimensions to handle safety and health during the pandemic. So it's absolutely kind of just a core premise of how the business operates that we intelligently do that mapping and matching.  Now of course, because we have the benefit of having a very, very broad range of both traditional hotels and alternative accommodations on the same platform, we can let people filter, search, compare side-by-side on a very comparable basis. And we think that provides a unique value to a lot of our customers. But as you would expect, we've been optimizing and modifying that quite a lot. And if you search for something this time this year and compare it to this time last year because of the pandemic, you get very different priority results coming back to you. Yes. Sure, Justin. Let me give you a couple of thoughts here. So first of all, we expect our business to have very attractive, and continue to have industry-leading margins when demand fully returns. There'll be a couple of puts and takes. So for example, as we build into new products like air, those will be dilutive to the margin rates, but obviously, healthy margin dollars and important to our business and strategy. And things like payments, again, will be diluted to the margin rate, but will contribute margin dollars. You have to take that into account in thinking about the long-term future. But as I said, we expect to have industry-leading margins in the long-term. Between now and when we get back to full recovery, there'll be some puts and takes. Obviously, for example, as we grow rapidly, as we expect to over the next few years, as the industry recovers, we will incur marketing expenses related to our bookings prior to those bookings turning into revenue. So during those periods of reacceleration, there'll be some downward pressure on our operating margins as we kind of build that book of business again. As I said, in the long-term, we expect to be very well positioned. No, I think you covered the major areas, Glenn. Obviously, we are -- as we enter, euphemistically, the second wave -- we were in -- all were into lockdown in the first, including customers and ourselves and our partners. There'll be some differences. Glenn talked about the force majeure which is obviously important. Typically, there are fewer bookings that are on the books right now because we're operating at much lower levels than we were back in the January, February time before everything hit. So that will also -- we do some of the extra workload that we have been on customer service, although we expect there to be some. And as I mentioned, we've seen customers, particularly recently favoring the more flexible cancellation policies, which, of course, isn't everybody's practice and that also -- has also had a slight leaning towards the agency product where the cancellation options are all flexible. So we're going into it eyes open. I'm sure there are going to be some things we haven't foreseen that come along. But I think it will be quite different in terms of how we'll be able to deal with this vis-a\u0300-vis the \"all hands on deck\" situation back in April and May. Yes, I do. Thanks, Glenn. Just to -- relative to the U.S. in the third quarter, when we look across the major markets, the U.S. was by far the strongest of the major markets for us from a performance point of view. The decline rates there were lower than the average and lower than any of our other territories. So we're not talking market share, but just to give you something directional to think about in terms of how the business performed. And then, Lee, on the cost side, yes, you're right, there's $250 million to $300 million of expense reductions annualized from Booking.com. There's also $80 million from the other brands as well. So please don't go that piece as well. You're right. Most of those related to volume-related functions in the business, things like customer service, so credit collection partner search. It's not entirely but largely functions like that which are tied to volume. So as volumes come back, as we expect to do over the next few years, we obviously need to replace that cost base. So we're looking at all sorts of alternatives, including how much more technology can we deploy in those areas as we would do normally.  The cost savings that we're not talking about right now are because we're in the middle of a crisis and we've got our hands full. We've getting the volume cost aspects out of the business. Already operating efficiencies in the business in other areas beyond what we're doing now, that's not the immediate focus. It's something we can take and to look at once we get beyond the crisis and we start to see a recovery. Of course, we've been running a fairly efficient business in the first place. We're not sitting with a large amount of excess fixed costs to optimize, but there's always opportunity.  And if you recall, we started talking about some of those things a little bit before the coronavirus hit in the spring of this year. So we'll come back to those in the fullness of time. And we'll also look to make sure that as we continue to drive efficiencies in the business that we don't bring back all the costs that had to -- lead the business as the business returns to prior volumes."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. While the impact of COVID-19 continues to weigh heavily on our results, we were pleased to see a sequential improvement in trends in our third quarter, which is our seasonally largest, and by far, most profitable quarter. The reported room nights, which includes the impact of cancellations, were down 43% year-over-year in the third quarter, which was a marked improvement from the 87% decrease we experienced in the second quarter. Continued pressure on ADRs in the quarter slightly offset by 1 point FX benefit, led gross bookings and revenue decline by about 4 percentage points more than room nights.  We recorded approximately $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA in the quarter, which was an improvement from the $376 million loss we reported in Q2, but this was 60% lower than in the third quarter last year.  As our results show, we are operating significantly below pre-COVID levels. However, we were encouraged by an improvement versus the second quarter, and we're pleased to see travelers and supply partners connecting through our platforms as they emerge from this spring's first wave of coronavirus infections. Delivering these results in what continues to be an extremely challenging and unpredictable environment is a credit to our team's relentless efforts to provide the best value and service to our traveler customers and supply partners.  The improvement in booking trends in the third quarter versus the second quarter was almost entirely driven by domestic travel with a very modest improvement in international travel. As we noted last quarter, our domestic business is benefiting from government restrictions on international travel, which forces consumers who want to travel they have to do it domestically. We believe the improvements in trends we've seen in this challenging environment demonstrate people's deep desire to find a way to travel with Q3 results benefiting from some pent-up demand after the lockdowns in Q2. Looking more closely to the shape of the quarter, the year-over-year decline in reportedly nights was relatively consistent each month of Q3 as the steady improvement in global trends that we saw from April through July flattened out in August and September. In October, reported room nights declined by about 58% compared to October 2019, and over the last seven days through yesterday, declined by about 70%.  We believe this worsening result is driven by increased virus infections and certain governments reimposing public health related restrictions. We believe that travel will continue to be greatly affected by infection trends and governments' public health responses. David will provide some more color on the regions in his remarks. As we think about the full fourth quarter, it's difficult to predict exactly what the next two months will look like in terms of travel demand, as we enter the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere amid rising COVID case counts in many areas. Given the trends we're currently seeing, we believe that year-over-year room night decline to be greater in Q4 than what we observed in October. If this turns out to be the case, it will be a very challenging for us to reach profitability in Q4. Despite the expected challenging fall and winter ahead of us, I remain confident in the long-term outlook for both our industry and our company. I strongly believe that people have an innate desire to travel, which will ultimately drive a recovery out of this crisis. When we think about the timing and shape of this recovery, we continue to believe that a key milestone will be a widely distributed vaccine or effective treatment, which will give people confidence that it is safe to travel. While we're encouraged by the news of progress being made on this front, we understand it will take time to produce and distribute any vaccine on a global basis to achieve effectiveness. I'm also encouraged to see some governments such as Japan and Thailand taking concrete incentives to incentivize travel. More programs like these and increased cooperative action from governments around the world would help accelerate the travel recovery. One of the progress we're seeing leaves me optimistic on the long-term outlook for our industry. I continue to recognize there'll likely be years and not quarters before the travel market returns to pre-COVID volumes. In the meantime, we continue to execute against a series of plans to navigate the company through these challenging times, and lay the important groundwork that will set us up to emerge from the pandemic in a position of strength. As we previously discussed, we've assessed our total cost structure, and developed plans to align it with expected market demand over the next few quarters. This work is complete at KAYAK, OpenTable, Agoda and Priceline. And we started to see some of the associated $80 million of annual cost savings [paid] in during the third quarter. We are making progress with our initiatives to reduce the workforce at Booking.com by up to approximately 25% with an associated annualized savings estimated between $250 million to $300 million. We've been taking restructuring action at Booking.com in various countries. And in some countries, we've implemented voluntary labor schemes. We are continuing to work with our works councils, employee representatives and other organizations to finalize plans in other countries. It is our hope to make the vast majority of the announcements to employees about these personnel reductions by the end of 2020. It's important to stress that these personnel restructuring decisions are difficult, and we do not take them lightly. Given the expected timeframe of the recovery that we have discussed, we believe that our restructuring plans are the correct actions for the company in order to right size the business.  In addition to our cost reduction actions, we remain focused on positioning the business to capture more travel demand as it develops during recovery and over the long-term. Part of this effort is continuing to build towards our long-term vision of the connected trips, seamless multi-product offering, which we believe will ultimately improve the customer experience on our platform, and drive enhanced loyalty and frequency over time.  In addition, we believe offering other travel products will provide opportunities through merchandising and customer acquisition to enhance the growth of our core accommodation business. Booking.com is continuing to take important early steps to build a flight product, and recently announced the launch of flights on Booking.com in the U.S. We see flights as a key component of the connected trip. It is an obvious opportunity for us to remove friction in the booking process for our customers. The connected trip vision of providing this frictionless customer experience we brought together by a seamless payment network, which we continue to develop and extend to more of our supply partners. We strongly believe that developing these payment capabilities has valuable benefits for both our bookers and supply partners, including potentially lower payment costs for our suppliers. Also, we will continue to work closely with our supply partners to help them respond to this environment, and more effectively market their properties on our platform in order to capture more travel demand as it returns over time. Finally, let me address the matter that we are following closely and that many of you may have questions about. The European Commission is working on a new regulatory framework for the digital economy, which, among other things, proposes to designate some large online companies who operate across Europe as gatekeepers and to establish rules and regulations for these businesses. The criteria for being a gatekeeper and the associated rules and regulations are in development. So the potential impact is difficult to estimate at this time. There have been questions and speculations that Booking.com maybe one of the designated gatekeepers, which we firmly believe would be incorrect for a number of reasons. The principal reason is that the accommodations market in Europe is very open and very competitive. Consumers have multiple online and offline choices to book accommodations and accommodation providers have multiple online and offline channels for our customers.  To put this into perspective, Booking.com booked about 7% of all potentially bookable accommodation room nights across all properties on our platform globally in 2019. Across Europe, that number was about 11%. As I mentioned, a new European regulatory framework is under development, and we will update you on developments during future calls. In conclusion, we believe we are responding well to this pandemic crisis. We are providing great service to our customers and are working with our supply partners so that together we can get them as much business as possible during these difficult days. I think it's been clearly sad that we had to let go and are still in the process of letting go so many dedicated hard working people. But it is a necessary step. And we expect to have some challenging quarters ahead of us. As I said before, we believe it will take years for travel to fully recover. However, I am confident in our team's ability to execute during these unprecedented times and continue to deliver value to our traveler customers and supply partners alike and to emerge from this crisis on a strong footing.  I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. Sure, Alex. It's Glenn speaking. Why don't I take -- we'll go in reverse order. I'm going to talk around flights, I'll talk a little bit about the alternative accommodation strategy and where we're going, and then I'll let Dave if he wants to talk to you about what you want in terms of year-to-date. So talking about the things we're doing with flights. We just started it for Booking.com in the States. So it's very, very, very early. But as I've always talked about this connected trip vision, flights is a very important part of it. Many people start with flights. So we believe that it's going to be an important way to get more customers into our funnel and see all the great offerings we have. Now payments is a very important part of our overall connected trip because, one thing, if you want to offer up, for example, a package, as you discussed, which we do want to offer at -- when we get to it, you have to have a payment platform. You've got to be able to do that because you can't combine into at one price, if you're not willing to able to take all the money from the customer upfront and then distribute to the different suppliers. That's the way to do it. So these things are very important to us, and it's early, but I am pleased to see us up and running. And later on, we'll be able to come back to you, hopefully, with some numbers and give you some -- in the future, some idea of how it's doing. Regarding alternative accommodation, it's clearly an important part of the business. We talked about it last quarter, how, many people in the second quarter went for alternate accommodations when you compare it back to the 2019 numbers because for the reasons that we talked about in terms of safety, people wanting to feel that they were weren't a big crowd, a lot of the issues we talked about last time. That's important around the world. And we've always talked about how important it is to offer up to our customers every single type of accommodation they may want. And we know by having more selection, that improves the proposition to the consumer. So we're continuing to do that. Now I've also talked about how, particularly in certain geographies like the U.S., we were not getting as much of the inventory as we should have and that we know is needed in certain types of alternative accommodations, primarily the individual home unit, and we continue to build that out, too, because we know people want that one, too. So strategy is to continue to build that out and make sure that we're offering the customer what they want, when they want it.  And David, I don't know if you want to give anything in terms of this question about year-to-date. Sure. Thank you, Kevin, for the question. It's obviously a very hard thing to answer because none of us are actually in the governmental meetings that are making these decisions on what to do in terms of lockdowns, how strict to be, when you're going to say you're going to open it up and they're making those projections now and they could very easily change. And people are even changing what they say week-to-week, day-to-day. And we see each day there's a new pronouncement by a new government. What we can say, though, is when these restrictions are put up, we do get cancellations right away, of course, for people who are planning to travel to certain regions. And that, obviously, is going to impact our as-booked room nights.  Certainly, people also say, \"Hey, I'm not going to make a new booking. I was going to make that new booking. I'm not going to do it because either, A, I'm not going to be able to travel there; or B, I'm concerned that, that area is going to be restricted or where I'm leaving from could be restricted.\" Now compared to April, though, I think there's a sense that I've gotten some thoughts about from some of the people who are involved in talking to our public affairs field, talking to governments, et cetera, is that they're trying to do it in a more selective way. Everybody knows the impact on the economies that a full lockdown, complete lockdown can do. So the governments are doing their best to try and not do complete lockdowns. But travel is always something that is immediately looked at as a potential increase in infections because people come from different regions. So I feel that we are still going to have a lot of disruption due to these very, very steep increasing infection rates. And I can't give you anything more than that. I don't know -- unless David, do you have anything you'd want to add? So Chris, on the performance marketing, you're smart to point out the fact that cancellations is going to impact the ROI significantly. So when we start seeing virus rates going up, we are immediately taking action that we don't want to be paying for a whole bunch of clicks that are not going to end up in revenue. Even if they end up in a booking, the booking gets canceled and you end up how you spent the money for nothing. So absolutely, there's a direct relationship. And as virus rates go up, as restrictions follow up in terms of restricting travel, we are immediately readjusting our expectation in terms of our performance marketing. So that is absolutely correct. In terms of the yield, we have not made any call in terms of when a vaccine is going to be declared effective and safe, nor how long it will take to be distributed or not. I think everybody, though, has read all the news about these things. I don't think anybody is expecting a large distribution or global distribution anytime soon, so certainly not nearly in the first quarter. So we're not based on our decisions on that at all. We are hopeful, though, that we've seen what happened in the spring, and we saw government actions did help, and we saw what happened in the summer. There was that rebound, pent-up demand. So we're hopeful. And David, you made the curve. So you can explain further on how we came up with what we are -- why we're doing what we're doing. Sure. So in terms of the long-term view of marketing, so as you all know, we built our company based on performance marketing. We also know, though, that we need to increase awareness in certain geographies, and we've always talked about being able to do that with -- from a brand perspective. One of the things that we just tested out and is very small, very small in the States, a digital brand campaign. You may have seen it, America is For Everybody. And we did it on a digital base. That was a digital brand effect to see how that would do. You may have seen the print version in the New York Times, not very digital but having an actual printed thing, but very low cost, and we thought it's very important to get that out, really what our values are as a company and what we stand for.  But it certainly is important that we get that awareness out there, 2 areas where we are, let's say, that we are under-indexing like the States. And we'll continue to do that as demand comes back, coming up with the different ways and always testing. We're always testing and digitally, you can do it better in terms of figuring out what your ROI is or not. Of course, the most important thing for us always is providing great service, and all the things we talked about, the great price, the great selection, the great customer service. If we can get the loyalty, people come back directly, instead always having to pay all that money for marketing to get people to come back. Get people to come directly is really the ultimate goal, of course. In terms of mobile, David, why don't you want to take that one, if you want to give anything further in terms of where that is? So let me take the second one. I'll let David take the first one. I didn't hear it so well. In terms of the overall competitive market, the travel business has always been extremely competitive. And whether there's a terrible lack of demand because of a pandemic, or it's boom times, back -- just -- it's hard to believe, but just a year ago or so, the competition continues to exist. And in fact, it's interesting because the European Commission, the regulators who are talking about that potential new regulations coming out, interestingly, they put out a report only a few weeks ago. And in the report, it's mentioned, in fact, that online travel is considered a fiercely competitive market. So clearly, regulators recognize that, too. And I don't think it's changed at all in terms of the fact that there's a lot less demand than there used to be. I think it's always competitive and always will be. Yes, David, the first part? David, why don't you take that in terms of our long-term thoughts about margin? Hi, Mark. So as I talked a little earlier about this certainly in the prepared remarks, we've seen a significant drop and talked about the last 7 days. Things move very quickly. Changes happen very rapidly when governments make changes in terms of ability to travel, restrictions in terms of going to restaurants, non-essential shops being closed. These things make immediate impact on people. In fact, I haven't actually tried it this time, but you can watch on our systems. You can watch an announcement go out and very, very quickly. You can see the impact towards cancellations or drops in bookings for future stays. So there's an incredible correlation between that. In terms of alternative accommodations, my thoughts -- it's interesting, the beginning of the crisis, I wasn't sure which way this might go because on the one hand, I thought that people would want to not be in a crowded hotel and risk getting infected or going to elevator. And so therefore, they would want an alternative combination where they could be separate from people, but I also recognize that people may be wanting industrial strength, disinfecting of rooms and professionalized treatment of the entire place. So maybe you go for hotels.  Clearly, we've seen the statistics very early in the Q2 area where we saw that significant increase in share shift to alternative accommodations for us than we've seen in Q3. It's not as much. I do believe that the trend that has been going on for a very long time of more and more people contemplating and then using the alternative accommodations, I think that trend has just been accelerated. In fact, it brought forward what would have happened perhaps on a year or 2 years or whatever in the future because now people did try this. And now I do believe that there is a continuous shift once you've tried it. And if you like it, you're going to put it in your consideration set for the future.  Now of course, when we talked about our share of alternative accommodations in total, when there's -- let's say -- let's go to even Q2 when it was a big number, 40%. Well, that meant 60% of the new bookings were for hotels. Hotels are still a really popular way to stay, and they will always be. That's one of the things that's great about our platform because we offer both. We offer the most of both. And that is something that is a winning combination for our customers. When they come on, we know from the data that many people who come on to our site, they're not sure yet where they want to stay. And they're looking at a lot of different types of accommodations. By offering them all the different types of accommodations, that makes us a winner in terms of getting them to book it with us. And I think that's going to be what we're going to keep going forward. Yes. So there is a tremendous shift into people wanting to have the free cancellation option. There's no doubt about that. And it's understandable. There's also -- we see in the booking window, people booking much, much closer into when they're going to actually arrive with their accommodation. Again, both of these things making perfect sense of what's going on around the world right now. And how long that will continue for? It's uncertain. But there was a crisis in the beginning of the year for everyone who had done a non-refundable accommodation. But then what happened is you had countries that were shutting down travel and the issue became, well, now the person can't go there. It was nonrefundable, but it's a force majeure situation. Do they get their money back? And if so, from who? Who's going to give it? The hotels aren't even around to actually give the money back, many of them, et cetera. And I will make the point of how proud I am of the customer -- our customer service team doing with all those people desperate to get their money back at the same time having to deal with the suppliers saying -- who would say, \"Listen, we're closed. We don't even have access to the money. We can't return it.\" And I'm really pleased with the way we acted in taking the money out of our own pocket essentially and giving it to those consumers who need that money now. They need it now; they can't wait. In doing that, I'm just so proud of our teams that did that and really made things better. Now it's much -- or many months after that, now if you book a non-refundable accommodation, even if there is a close-down by a government, you're not getting your money back because everybody is aware of the situation. Every -- your eyes are wide open when you buy that nonrefundable, you're not going to get that money back. And so people aren't pretty much behind the refundable one. I do expect though over time that will go back because of the benefit of getting a better price. David, do you want to give any comments on this at all, that I don't know what you'd say? Deepak, I think that certainly, what you're saying could be the case, and I think it's hard to say, and as David said, we're not expecting to hit the lows of April yet. But I'll point out there are counter facts, too, such as, as we're entering the spring and into the summer, it was getting warmer. It was getting lighter in the Northern Hemisphere and you could travel locally and have a nice holiday away from wherever you were. If you were in a city that was suffering significant infection rates, and you just wanted to get out, it was easy to say, we're going to drive or get my car and drive not so far away and it's pleasant, I can go outside, maybe near a beach, maybe near a lake, whenever, let's take a little holiday, okay? Not so great in the middle of the winter in the dark. So that's kind of a factor. Who knows? I think the right way to think about this stuff is not think about right now, second wave, next couple of months. I think the important thing is to think about the long term. And that's what we continue to put our focus on, is making sure that we're coming up with our systems, our products, our services, working with our suppliers so we have everything set up right when that demand comes back for real in the way we know it will because all pandemics do end; they do. Whether there is a vaccine or not, and we hope there'll be one soon, and all the news says they'll be one relatively soon. But even if not, even not a vaccine a pandemic will end, people will start traveling again. And we will, I believe, have that very wonderful rebound and come out of this crisis. Well, there's definitely a widened use case because we're operating in a very, very different world right now. I haven't done any research. We have not done the research to really nail down how many people decided, I want to use an alternative accommodation because I cannot live in just a one-room apartment in the city for the next month. I need to get out in a bigger space in the country. I don't know how many of you did that. Where people said, I'm working from home, and I live in a studio, I need another place. I can't do that; where a family that say, the kids are going crazy. We got to get out of this place and go there. So there are a lot of alternative uses of the alternative accommodations that never existed before. And that could very well have driven that up. I think in the long run, though, again, people having experienced this, now it goes into the consideration set for any type of use, standard holiday or not. And that's why I do believe, in the long run, continue to build our inventory for the single property type use is very important. So why don't I take a little bit of the first part of the U.S. and then, David, you can say anything you want to add to that and then talk about the cost cutting. So absolutely, I've said many times that we are under-indexed in the U.S., and that's a great opportunity for us. That's a case where we have the capability of adding to our future growth by doing better things in the U.S.  In terms of how to do it, in terms of -- you mentioned the balance sheet, how much is lean, et cetera, right now, there's not a tremendous amount of demand right now for doing anything. So the idea of putting together a big brand campaign or just to make them more awareness right now, we're just trying to lean into performance marketing, that to me is not a good use of money. We've always said that we want to be frugal in the way we try and get more customers and how we build our brand et cetera, want to do it the right way. So obviously, I mentioned already about getting more supply for a certain type of alternative accommodation in properties, that's absolutely something that we are doing and going and doing that. And it's also coming up and putting and investing in flight in the U.S. I mentioned that one already, and I mentioned now down the road, we'll have packages. So building on that and building out payments, which are so important for all different reasons. We can go into why that's an important thing and making sure we have that set up right in the U.S. and we have lots of our hotel partners onto the payment network.  So all those things are investments, and that is what we are doing. But what we're not going to do is go out and do a giant, giant brand campaign where literally nobody is listening to that right now in this winter. And we're not going to do it that way. David, do you want to add anything? Thank you. So the first thing I want to do, I just want to say thank you once again to all of our employees who have been working so hard to help our partners and customers in these very difficult times. And of course, I absolutely want to thank our customers who choose from the many available options to book their travel through us. And finally, I have to thank all of our supplier partners who continue to work closely with us as we try and get through this crisis. While the near term will definitely be challenging I remain confident in our long-term value proposition, and we are focused on the steps we have to take today to create a better company tomorrow. Please be safe, and good night."

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We felt the full impact of COVID-19 during the second quarter, with reported room nights, which includes the impact of cancellations, declining 87% year-over-year. Newly book room nights, excluding the impact of cancellations, declined 68% in the quarter. The high cancellation rate of pre-COVID bookings, which we witnessed in March and April, combined with the overall weak travel demand environment, significantly impacted our revenue and EBITDA this quarter. Revenue declined 84% versus last year, and we recorded an adjusted EBITDA loss of $376 million. The first time we have produced a quarterly EBITDA loss since 2001. We witnessed the greatest negative impact from the virus in April is newly booked room nights in that month declined over 85% year-over-year. After April, room night trends have steadily improved with newly booked room nights in July, declining about 35% year-over-year. The improved booking trends were primarily driven by domestic travel with international trends, seeing much more limited improvement. In July, we reached slightly positive year-over-year growth or overall domestic newly book room nights, though, of course, there are many countries that still have negative year-over-year growth rates. In addition, it is an obvious point that our domestic business is benefiting from prohibitions and restrictions on international travel, which forces consumers who want a holiday to travel domestically. While almost all of our global markets showed improvement through the quarter, Europe and the United States had the highest contribution to the improved domestic booking trends. As a reminder, a very high percentage of our new bookings have been made with flexible cancellation policies and may be canceled in the future. And as we see, new outbreaks of COVID-19 and cancellations may increase again. While we are pleased to see signs of recovery in domestic travel, we want to emphasize that it is impossible to tell how the coming months will unfold. Unfortunately, many areas of the world continue to have very high infection rates. And in some regions, they are dealing with new outbreaks after having significantly lowered their infection rates. As a result, after a period of relatively steady improvement in many geographies, in recent weeks, we are seeing these growth rates worsen in some countries. We continue to believe that in order to recover to pre-COVID levels, we will need to have a vaccine or effective treatment, which will take time to produce and distribute globally at the scale needed. We are pleased to have recently read news about progress on this front. But we believe it will be years and not quarters before the travel market returns to pre-COVID volumes. In those countries and regions where shelter-in-place rules were relaxed and economies reopened, we witnessed booking trends improve quickly. We believe part of this initial burst of demand is due to people's pent-up desire to go somewhere after being in a lockdown situation. It also demonstrates people's deep desire to travel, providing it to safe. Throughout this initial reopening phase, we have seen new customer booking and travel patterns emerge. In line with our growth in domestic travel, we are seeing that bookers are choosing to stay closer to home, and are more interested in less urban areas than pre-COVID. The share of these types of bookings on our platform has increased meaningfully this quarter. We also see that our customers are booking more alternative accommodations than in the past, which often have the benefit of reduced potential interaction with other travelers. In Q2, Booking.com, alternative accommodations represented about 40% of all new bookings in the quarter. We've all seen an increase in travelers booking stays with more flexible cancellation policies due to the uncertain travel environment we currently face. Our platform is well-positioned to capture these travel demand patterns due to our very capable marketing teams, global footprint, extensive accommodation choice and diversification of cancellation policy and rate types. We have adapted our marketplace to operate more efficiently in this new travel demand environment to benefit both our supply partners and customers. We are working closely with our supply partners, so they can more effectively market on our platform to capture the growing travel demand. As our partners seek assistance to better respond to these new domestic and intra-regional demand patterns, we are working to provide more information, and it wise as to the nature of the demand and offering the best programs on our platform that will help them capture this demand. We are also helping our partners more effectively communicate and showcase the steps that they have taken to increase their own health and safety protocols at their properties. Something we know travelers are keen to understand, in order to make informed booking decisions. Finally, we continue to extend our payments platform to more of our supply partners, and it remains a key initiative for us this year. Developing merchant capabilities has valuable benefits for both our supply partners and bookers. As we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we articulated a series of plans to help navigate the company through these challenging times. First phase was focused on stabilizing the business in the initial stages of the crisis, which included supporting our employees and increasing our cash position. The second phase was focused on optimizing the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. The final phase is focused on positioning the business to capture travel demand as it develops, so that we can emerge from the crisis on a strong footing and extend our leadership position. We completed the stabilization phase and are now working through our optimization phase. These actions have allowed us to lay the important groundwork that will set us up to emerge from pandemic in a position of strength. During our optimization phase, we assessed our total cost structure and develop plans to align it with expected market demand over the next few quarters. We completed this work at KAYAK, OpenTable and Agoda in the second quarter, and recently completed in a Priceline in July. The restructuring charge we took in the second quarter only relates to the rightsizing activities at KAYAK, OpenTable and Agora. These actions had the effect of reducing headcount by approximately 22% across these brands, including some including some furloughed employees. While the cost savings net of restructuring costs will be modest this year, we expect that these cost reductions will produce over $80 million of annual personnel savings. With respect to Booking.com, we have further developed our intentions for the appropriate level of personnel and other cost reductions in light of expected business loss. Booking.com is in the process of consulting with its works councils and employee representatives and working through local labor regulations in the countries where we operate. We hope to finalize our plans and to have more definitive news over the coming months. We expect that up to about 25% of Booking.com's global workforce could be impacted by these actions. We expect that business functions most closely tied to its transaction volumes will be impacted the most. At this time, and subject to our consultation with the Dutch Works Council, employee representatives and other organizations, we estimate that these cost reductions at Booking.com could produce annual personnel savings between $250 million to $300 million. This preliminary estimate may change and we will update you in the coming months on the expected restructuring costs associated with these reductions. It is our hope to make all announcements to employees about these cost reductions by the end of 2020. In conclusion, we have learned from when we could not travel, how important travel is to our lives, whether to see family or friends, or to explore new places and cultures, travel is fundamental to who we are. Our Wish List Campaign, which drew on insights from millions customers like accommodations they would want to visit, affirm the innate desire or demand that will always endure forward travel. This campaign reiterates the energy and passion that we know remains for travel. This has been a challenging quarter and we've had to make some very difficult decisions. We believe it will take years for travel to fully recover, but I have great confidence in our employees and our capabilities and I cannot be more proud of how our entire team has handled themselves during these trying times. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the second quarter and provide some color on the trends we saw through the quarter and into July. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the quarter. In our last earnings call in May, we discussed the trends we saw early in the second quarter, including a year-over-year decline in newly booked room nights of about 85% in April. As a reminder, newly booked room nights excludes the impact of cancellations. April ultimately proved to be the low point for newly booked room night declines in Q2 as we saw a steady improvement in both May and June, driven by increasing levels of domestic travel. Domestic room night declines improved steadily in Europe, North America, and across Asia. However, we saw less improvements in the domestic declines in South America, Middle East, and Africa. Newly booked room nights for the full quarter declined about 68% as we exited the quarter down about 50% in the month of June. Our Q2 reported room nights, which include the impact of cancellations, decreased 87% for the full quarter. Reported room nights in June declined by about 55% and improving from an over 100% decline in April when we receive more cancellations than new bookings. We saw a continued improvement in the cancellation rate since April as we work through the way the cancellations for bookings made prior to COVID-19. Although we're now getting closer to pre-COVID levels of cancellation rates, this improving trend could easily reverse if we see continued outbreak to the virus or new impositions of travel restrictions, especially considering the very high percentage of our recent bookings that are being made with flexible cancellation policies. Gross bookings declined 91% in Q2, which is greater than the decline in reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations of decreasing about 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Note that the high level of cancellations in the quarter significantly distorted ADRs. As a point of comparison, our newly booked ADRs, excluding the impact of cancellations, declined year-over-year by only a couple of percentage points in Q2. And an increasing mix of bookings in the high ADR markets like the U.S. and Western Europe helped largely offset the pressure of the offset the pressure of the broader lodging industry ADR declines. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $630 million and decreased 84% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted than reported at room nights and gross bookings due to the fact that some of the cancellations we received in Q2 were for check-ins are expected to occur in later quarters. This dynamic created by cancellations in the quarter also substantially increased the ratio of revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in the quarter. The substantial the quarter also substantially increased the ratio of revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in the quarter. The substantial reduction in revenue contributed to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $376 million in Q2. While we made significant reductions in our variable expense lines reduction in revenue contributed to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $376 million in Q2. While we made significant reductions in our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q2. As we mentioned, we've taken actions across the quarter to reduce operating expenses as we optimize and align our cost structure with the new demand environment. However, the cost benefit of these actions were not fully realized in Q2 and the cost reductions and net restructuring charges are expected to be modest in 2020. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, decreased 85% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. We expect our marketing expenses will remain significantly below 2019 levels for the remainder of the year. Sales and other expenses decreased 47% year-over-year due primarily to a reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions as well as lower outsourced customer service costs as we move through the quarter and needed less support in processing -- reduced level of cancellations in May and June. Bad debt and other credit losses were up about 25% year-over-year in the quarter. However, we saw a far small increase in provisions in Q2 than what we recognized in Q1. We expect sales and other expansion will continue to be down year-on-year in the second half of 2020. However, the extent of the decline will be impacted by level of volume we see in the business. Personnel expenses decreased 18% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis, primarily due to a $100 million benefit from government aid packages, primarily in the Netherlands and the U.K. Currently, we do not anticipate further material benefits to personnel expenses from government aid in future quarters. We expect personnel expenses in the second half of 2020 will decline less than we saw in Q2 as we'll no longer see the benefit from government aid. We expect the personnel cost reductions we made in Q2 at Agoda, KAYAK and OpenTable, plus the reductions we made early in Q3 of Priceline to produce over $80 million of annualized personnel savings starting in the second half of 2020. As Glenn mentioned, we have further developed our intentions for the appropriate levels of personnel booking.com and are in the process of reviewing these potential reductions with works councils, employee representatives and other organizations. We estimate that the potential cost reduction of Booking.com could produce annual personnel run rate savings between $250 million and $300 million. And because of the processes we have to go through at Booking.com over the next few months, we expect the majority of these savings will not be realized until 2021. As Glenn mentioned, we'll update you on the estimated cost of achieving these savings as soon as they're available, at which time we'll file any required amendments to our 8-K. G&A expenses decreased 43% year-over-year, largely driven by reduced discretionary spend such as T&E and other personnel-related expenses as well as lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. We expect that G&A will continue to be down meaningfully year-over-year in the back half of the year. However, the level of decline may be less than what we saw in the second quarter. Information technology expenses decreased 1% year-over-year due to lower outsourced data center and cloud costs. We expect the IT expenses will remain roughly flat versus the prior year in the back half of the year. Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in the operating expenses in the P&L. The $34 million of restructuring charge to be recorded in the second quarter only relates to the rightsizing activities at KAYAK, OpenTable and Agoda. I note these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. On a GAAP basis, we incurred an operating loss of $485 million in Q2. We recorded GAAP net income of $122 million in the quarter as we benefited from an $835 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investments in methane. This gain was partially offset by $55 million of FX remeasurement losses on our eurobonds. We excluded these gains and remeasurement losses from our non-GAAP results. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 end cash investment balance increased to $13.4 billion from a March ending balance of $9.2 billion, primarily due to the $4.1 billion bond and convertible note offering we completed in early April. Our long-term investment balances benefited from the $835 million gain on equity investments in the quarter I previously mentioned. These increases to our cash and investment balance were partially offset by the $1.2 billion cash settlements at one of our convertible notes in June. We had $122 million in positive operating cash flow and $52 million in positive free cash flow in the quarter. Change in working capital were a source of about $300 million of cash in the quarter compared to $820 million use of cash in Q1. The improvement from Q1 was largely driven by a Q1 prepayment of taxes in the Netherlands of about $720 million that was subsequently refunded in April. The small reduction in Q2 relative to reduction in Q2 relative to Q1 in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liability balances were mostly offset by a small reduction in our accounts receivable balance in the quarter. Our improvements -- our improved liquidity position is the result of efforts we took to stabilize our business for the immediate shock of the crisis. We'll continue to focus on a strong liquidity position for the immediate shock of the crisis. We'll continue to focus on a strong liquidity position given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. As a part of these efforts to bolster our liquidity and consistent with our clients last quarter, we've halted our approaches of stock and will not initiate repurchases to have better visibility into shape and timing of a recovery. Now on to our thoughts for the third quarter. Consistent with our approach last quarter, I'll not provide full quarterly guidance, but we'll instead provide you with some color on our preliminary July results, which will help you get a better sense of recent top line trends. As Glenn mentioned, our newly booked room nights in July were down about 35% year-over-year. Of course, these new bookings may be counseled in the future, especially as a very high percentage of new bookings continue to be made with flexible cancellation policies. The year-over-year decline in reported room nights in July was about 45%, which is worse than our newly booked room night decline in the month as the cancellation rate remained above prior levels. Bookings for the full third quarter may vary from July's results depending upon the level of travel demand and cancellations we experienced in August and September. We expect gross bookings in the third quarter will decline year-over-year by several percentage points more than our reported room nights due to negative pressure on local currency ADRS. And we expect revenue declines for the quarter will be roughly in line with what we see in gross bookings. We currently expect adjusted EBITDA will be positive in the third quarter, given the trends we're seeing in our business so far through July, as well as the fact that Q3 is our seasonally strongest quarter. This expectation is based on the assumption we do not see a meaningful increase in travel restrictions or shelter in place rules or decrease in consumer willingness to travel as a result of continued or increased core outbreaks in the quarter. As we noticed -- as we noted, we've seen an improvement in our newly book room night trends to continue into July, largely driven by domestic travel. Our newly booked domestic room nights increased slightly year-over-year in the month of July for the first time during the COVID pandemic. Domestic room nights represented over 70% of our newly booked room nights in both Q2 and July, up significantly versus 2019, which was about 45%. Our Booking.com is domestic, alternative accommodation newly booked room nights increased nicely year-over-year in July. And its domestic core accommodation newly booked room nights were down slightly. We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. We have seen the length of the booking window begin to return to prior year levels in June after expanding versus the prior year in both April and May. Mobile bookings, particularly through our app, continue to gain share in the second quarter into July. And finally, we continue to see greater than 50% of our newly booked room nights coming to us through the direct channel. On a regional basis, Europe and the United States have been the largest contributors for the improvement in newly room night trends since April. However, as Glenn mentioned, in the past weeks, we've witnessed a plateauing or deterioration of new booking trends in several places that have seen increasing outbreaks of COVID-19 cases, including Spain, Belgium, Australia, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan and the U.S. We've also seen an associated increase in cancellation rates in many of these places. These recent trends are a reminder we're still in the very early days of a fragile recovery that will likely be uneven for some time to come. As Glenn emphasized, this has been a challenging quarter that has involved some very difficult decisions and a number of other actions that will ultimately help us optimize our business with expected level of market demand. We have confidence that through these actions, we'll be well positioned to come out of the crisis and extend our leadership role in the global travel marketplace. With that, we'll now take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the update and all the details on July. Could you talk about what you're seeing from your data in terms of market share, whether you're taking market share based on those July numbers? And if so, what are the key drivers there? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Kevin. It's Glenn. No, we don't go around trying to at what we think our share is up or down. Obviously, you probably have a very good idea to what you think of our competitors and where they are. I will say what David said is, we are pleased with what we saw in July. What I think what's very, very important that everybody, keep in mind that this is a very volatile recovery and the countries that David went out and listed that we have seen increased outbreaks. That was not a complete list. We'd use up the entire time if we listed every single place that have seen places that are suddenly having increases in COVID. So I would caution, again, just what David said, yes, we were pleased with what we saw in July. But we have to be careful about the future.\nKevin Kopelman: Thanks. And then if I could ask one other question on the cost cuts. You mentioned $250 million to $300 million in personnel is that a good number for kind of overall cost savings? Or what would that number look like if you included all the actions you've taken across the company to cut back?\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. Kevin, we gave you two numbers. We gave you $80 million annualized for the brand apart from Booking.com. And then $250 million to $300 million for the potential savings of Booking.com based upon all the process points that we talked about. So those would directly impact the personnel line. So those we've broken out. We mentioned in some -- many other areas of the business, our expenses are down, but we haven't really work through all the details exactly what those are going to be is we are focused upon our employ our employee-related costs first. But obviously, with less people, there will be less expenses to come with it in other areas. And as we work through those plans as well, we'll make them available. But the biggest change is going to be to personnel cost.\nKevin Kopelman: Thanks, David. Thanks, Glenn.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. \nChris Kuntarich: This is Chris on for Lloyd. Can you just first talk about the performance of your alternative accommodation business in the quarter in July? Just curious if that was growing. And yes, whether or not you guys in testing new distribution channels in the quarter.\nDavid Goulden : So Chris, one of the things I think -- and let me go to the Q2, that 40% number that I gave in my opening remarks, and as we said, that is an increase. It's a big number compared to what we had seen in the past. And it's something that we're pleased. But of course, we all, I think, have a good sense of what's going on. And that is a change in demand because people's concern about being in a large group and a hotel lobby. I think the thing that we really have to think about is what do we think about in the future. Is this a momentary thing? Or is this something that's going to continue long-term or not? And I'll say one thing that we talked about in the past is how we want to continue. We say, this in one for COVID that we want to continue to build our alternative accommodations. Now we thought it was an important thing for us to continue to build out all the types of alternate combinations, and we recognize that we are probably short in certain types, particularly the single property, home type property, and we want to continue to build that. And we also talked that. And we also talked about -- we thought that we were perhaps under-indexing in terms of awareness in certain geographies like the U.S., for example, and we want to continue to improve upon that. So we're going to do that. And we certainly are going to use every single marketing channel we can to get that information out to consumers that we have a great product, and that is something that they can look to us to get a great deal. And that's something that I think is important. I am very pleased, of course, with the numbers we saw, but I also like the fact that we are perhaps the unique in the terms of all the types of combinations we are able to provide all throughout the world. And that's given us, I think, a great opportunity going forward. \nChris Kuntarich: Got it. And if I could just squeeze in there a quick follow-up here. Just thinking about marketing ROIs here. Could you just talk about what you guys are seeing in the performance marketing channels? Yes, it looked like you had gained a lot of share in Trivago. I was curious, if there was any other channels you guys were seeing similar results.\nGlenn Fogel: Well, I think, I'll confine myself saying, look, we're always looking for high-quality traffic at the right price. Now when I say, high-quality, they want to convert well, one of the low probability of cancellation, I wanted to come back to us later directly. And that's what we're going to continue to do and we've always done that. And that's no change from our previous way to run our business.\nChris Kuntarich: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nAlex Wang: Hi. This is Alex Wang on for Brian. First question, can you just talk to us about the new growth opportunities like the U.S. or in destination, in areas you're focused on to improving the go-to-market strategy, particularly in the U.S.?\nGlenn Fogel: Alex, you say -- so you're asking what is our -- just in general, you\u2019re saying -- again, our go-to-market in the U.S., you're saying?\nAlex Wang: Yes, that's right. So, ability to sort of maybe, yes, improve sort of the brand and then growth opportunities in the market like the U.S. and then any difference in the go-to-market strategy?\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. Okay. So, we have said this in the past and I\u2019ll repeat clearly more so now. We think the U.S. is a great opportunity for us. We think we under index, we've got a great partners. I was just saying, all types of accommodations. And with what we're building with our connected trip, we think we're going to offer an incredible value proposition to consumers. So we are absolutely excited about the long-term future of Liz right now. Yes, people are traveling a little bit more, certainly than they were in April. But we all know what the situation is right now. And what you don't want to be doing is spending a lot of money pushing out a brand message, if people are not hearing -- are not listening to it, because they are not ready to travel or they can't travel. So we want to be careful about that. So I think we're going to have to wait. And so we have a healthier environment, where people -- more people are ready to listen to that message, before we're going to start spending money on it.\nAlex Wang: Got it. And just as a follow on. With the reported or stated -- sort of, reduced headcount at Booking.com, can you give more color around areas of the company that you're looking into here. Particularly, given, I think, Booking.com has been run pretty lean in the past. And then, just sort of higher level, how does this change your investment priorities beyond hotels now compared to where they were pre-COVID?\nGlenn Fogel: So we made very clear in our discussions with our employees, our works council, our employee organizations. And everyone have to have these conversations with. As you know, there are different regulations around the world in terms of potential conversation to have. We made it very clear that the higher wage is going to be on volume-related positions, because our volumes are way down. Those are the ones. And I made it very clear how much I believe in the future of the connected trend, the investments we're making, the things that we believe in the long-term will give us a competitive advantage over everybody. And I would -- I think, I'd be doing the wrong thing, if I was saying, we should stop trying to invest in those areas. I think they're important for the long run. And, yes, this is a terrible time right now. And yes, our financials are being hurt by this. That, to me, does not mean we should stop investing in our future.\nAlex Wang: Great. Thanks, Glenn.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. Glenn, curious what you might be doing in terms of investing on the supply side during a period of lower demand? As you said, the mix shift moving towards alternative accommodations to some degree on what people are on the book. Is there anything you're doing in terms of changing some of the strategy of partnering on supply or trying to bring supply on against the demand environment you find yourself in. That's number one. And then maybe on the buyback, I know, you need to see a better environment to come back to the capital return policy, can you give us a little bit of sense of what that environment might have to look like? Like what should we be looking for from the outside in that you would need to see in the business, before you're back to returning capital? Thanks so much for any color. Appreciate it.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. I'll take the first one and I'll let Dave talk about our potential capital return at some point, balance sheet in general. So one thing we've talked about in the past a great deal is, if there was a recession, what's going to happen in terms of the supply relations. Would they be more willing to lean in with us? Would they be more open to conversations? What will they do? And what we've been seeing, and it's pretty much what we thought would happen is that, when demand goes away and supply is looking for demand, they're looking to do it any way they can and they are open to conversation that perhaps they weren't in the past. So our teams are out there talking with on the supply side and whether it be alternative accommodations, properties or in the big hotel tans or anybody who is in our business. Right now, they need demand, and they're looking for can you supply to me. So our teams are coming up with creative in different ways to try and provide something that will help them because we now look, we this number two sided marketplace. We got to do good for both sides. And that's what we're doing right now and I think we're making progress with it. We're having some very good conversations that may not have had in the past. But I think that in the future, we will hopefully have this be a long-term better relationship with some of our partners as we continue to develop ways that we show their win-win for everybody.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. And Eric, on the buyback side, just to elaborate a little bit upon what I said. So, I said, we certainly would not initiate and so we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. So, what do we mean by that? We mean having best certainty as to what the future looks like. And when it's going to happen and what the shape of the recovery is going to look like. Nobody is predicting a V-shaped recovery now. I think that's not what people are looking at, but we're looking at some period of uncertainty right now. Until we figure out more about what's happening with vaccine and how that would impact people's comfort. And then, of course, is the economic impact of the COVID prices and what that does to people's ability to travel and spend money, so all these things go into it. So, there's not a single milestone to look for. But if you ask me to characterize the environment, which we will consider, reinitiating capital returns, it would be an environment where we have much more visibility and confidence into the shape of the future.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with SunTrust.\nNaved Khan: Yes. Thanks a lot. Maybe, Glenn, can you maybe shed some light on the mix of direct versus paid bookings, I think historically, you talked about how directors think historically, you talked about how directors had already crossed 50% market. How does it look does it look today? And do you think that today? And do you think that maybe an elevated level of direct bookings can continue to occur on a go-forward basis? Or would you think of that as a temporary shift? And then I have a follow-up.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. So we've said this and we will continue to say how important we believe is direct booking is really where we want to be in the future is provide such great value than our customers, once they learn about this, they come back to us directly. They don't want to think about going somewhere else. And such great value that our customers once they learn about this by, they come back to us directly. They don't want to think about going somewhere else. And through the connected trip and building up all different types of, let's say, lower friction type ways to travel. That it makes it so that we are the first thought always. I'm not sure, David, if you want to give me more color to where we are now. I'll let him do it. But I will say the system is important to us.\nDavid Goulden: I think, Glenn, as we said, we continue to be over 50% direct. But I think there are some important things that are driving that, which are good indicators. And we mentioned them briefly a little bit on the last call as well. I mentioned in my remarks earlier that we continue to see the app being an important contribution because that is really our stickiest kind of touch point with our customers because that is not only a place you go to book travel, but increasingly, it's way interact with us during the travel experience, which is very important as well. And we also see, as we mentioned last quarter, we also see things like an increasing percentage mix from our Genius customers as well, this quarter as well. So these are positive things correlate long-term to a higher mix of direct bookings and just this ability to create, as Glenn has said a few times, the connected chip, where you're not just booking with us and then going on the trip, but you're really booking multi verticals. You're interacting with us during the trip, we're providing things like dynamic customer support, et cetera, a very different environment in the future, which is obviously powered by big data, machine learning, AI, et cetera. So, we think these are important signs that we're moving in the right direction.\nNaved Khan: Great. And the follow-up I had is really just to clarify the domestic mix you gave us, Glenn, 70% domestic. How does that treat the EU -- treat it as a single entity? Or are you looking at country levels?\nGlenn Fogel: It's a country domestic. We do -- we sometime look at our region, Intra regional. But if you're an Italian tourist and you went to France, that's not a domestic travel.\nNaved Khan: Got it. Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: I'm looking at David, just to confirm.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. \nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. David, can you help us quantify the pressure on new bookings from the mix shift towards domestic ADRs, obviously, on a comparable basis are lower in various markets. But are there any other variables either from consumer spending less or staying fewer nights that will keep the bookings growth below the trends on the new room nights? And then what is the equal and dollar bookings comparable metric for the down 35 room nights during the month of July? Thank you.\nDavid Goulden: I'm going to ask you to clarify the second part, Deepak, let me ask -- answer the first part. So yes, there's obviously many moving parts with ADRs this quarter. And as I mentioned, for newly booked room nights, the ADRs actually, in total, only off a couple of points, even though there's a mix shift, obviously, within that too domestic. So we see a number of things going on. What we see is in some case, obviously, some people are substituting what would have been an international booking for a domestic booking, and those can potentially be higher ADRs because historically, international travel typically resulted in a higher ADR and longer stay. And to the extent that some of that is substituting into domestic, that could be helping our ADRs on a country-by-country basis because in some of our core countries in Europe, we actually saw ADRs up quite meaningfully in the quarter. So there's a number of mix related things going on within the whole ADR environment. And as I said, essentially flat, just down a couple of points in total in the quarter despite the fact that we know that like-for-like, there are certainly ADR pressures in the marketplace. And Deepak, I missed the second part of your question, could you just repeat that, please?\nDeepak Mathivanan: Yes. No, I was just going to ask, how should we think about the down 35 and room night on an equal and dollar bookings basis? Is that -- to your point, should we view that as fairly close?\nDavid Goulden: No, no, we took -- well, in terms of -- well, no, there's still going to be an ADR pressure on that. So what we said was we're down 35 in July in room nights on a newly booked basis, down 45 on a reported basis, the cancellation rates running a little higher than they were last year. And then a few points more than that down in terms of gross bookings and revenue.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Got it. That's very helpful. Great. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Almond with JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Dave on for Doug. Thanks. Thank you for taking the questions. First one, could you talk about the profile of the people who are still traveling, for example, would you consider them to be avid travelers with higher LCVS? And they're traveling despite all that is happening? Or just people who are traveling because they have to? And could you just tie that to how important you think it is to gain shares early in the recovery? And then secondly, for David, on the fixed cost side, given your comments about cost savings being more volume related, should we expect these costs to come back with volume returning? And do you think margins will look meaningfully different when volumes return to pre-COVID levels?\nDavid Goulden: Why don't you take the first one, and I'll take the second.\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So in terms of profile, I have not looked in any sort of customer segmentation recently in terms of the write-down. So I can't speak specifically in terms of deep debt on the profiles. But I would say that it would not surprise me if I did it now next week, it will show not that different in terms of what it was pre-COVID. People still want to travel, people still sometimes have to travel, and sometimes do it voluntarily, but the shape is -- the change is where they're traveling and how they're traveling. So, for example, because people can, as I mentioned, you can't travel internationally from the U.S. to Europe, let's say, what is happening, those people are traveling domestically. And we've seen that in terms of people very much wanting to travel close to home at first, because they want to be able to drive there, because concerned about getting on a plane. But in terms of the actual different types of customers within it, I don't think I've seen much of anything, except for one thing that I think is very, very critical to talk about, and that is business travel. Now we have always been a much more leisure oriented company. And we all know from the businesses that we work in that business travel has been significantly curtailed or stopped? And what does that do? Well, certain properties, certain supply chain, for example, high-end hints that are no longer able to get that high ADR revenue. And that, of course, is helping in terms of a distributor like us because we have leisure customers to help fill those things. Now how long will this go? This is a long-term trend. I think that this could be helpful to us, and may be helpful to us in the long-term. As the shift from business to leisure continues for a long time, we will be in a better position with our supply partners because we're able to provide them with what they need, which is heads and beds.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. And on the cost side of things. So yes, we said the majority of the personnel reductions will be in volume-related functions. Obviously, that will -- those will, over time, come back. We look to continue to drive efficiency in many of those areas through our business, over time through automation and other areas. So they don't necessarily have to come back for job as volume return, they will come back. And in terms of our expectation for the longer-term when we get to pre-COVID levels, which as we said, is not about quarters but is about years. We expect the business to have a very attractive margins when demand fully recovers. All things being equal, we expect to have industry-leading margins in the long-term. Obviously, the business in the future will look a little different than it did pre-COVID. For example, we're building out new products like air which will be dilutive to margin rate, but will also be important to our business and our strategy in the connected trip and selling more accommodations. So there'll be puts and takes, but we expect to have industry-leading margins in the longer term.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you. So Glenn, is the nature of the personnel reductions going to be, I guess, evenly distributed across your focused regions? Or are you planning any geographical exits of the business as a whole? And I guess in a roundabout way, I'm trying to ask about your plans to go after the China outbound opportunity? And also just following up on the connected trips. You recently signed an agreement with Kiwi, I believe to distribute their content. So where are you in the integration process? And how will this be presented? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel : Yes. So two separate questions. So in terms of, again, we're having our conversations with our important partners, works councils, employee organizations, et cetera, and having going through this site Booking.com. And the key thing we mentioned is how a lot of this is volume related. So where the volume is most effective areas are going to end up having a higher weighted impact. That's just the way it's obviously going to happen. I don't think you can -- we certainly are not purposely coming with a strategy change. We believe that it's important for us to be able to provide travel services throughout the world, as the leader in the world, we want to maintain that. In terms of our regular amusement, I think that's what you're talking about Kiwi, correct?\nStephen Ju: Yes.\nGlenn Fogel : Right. So we think attractions is an important part of our connected trip theory and strategy that we've talked about. And the faster we can get different types of attractions up and running and available to our customers the better. However, we do the connection ourselves, where we go out, we partner with somebody or we buy somebody, whatever it is, we want to get that stuff up, so we can provide that value. And [indiscernible] is a great partner. They had proposition. We decide to join up. And we are now live in a certain number of cities, and we are going to continue to build that out. And I believe that this is one of the things that will help really provide value. When somebody is traveling, they use that app that David mentioned, more people use the app. And when you're in a location and you're able, just one touch be able to go to an attraction. I think that's a convenience, and we'll be able that value, a price differential. I think that, again, will give us a competitive advantage, but we're going to have the supply first, of course.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize, if it's already been asked, but just thinking about hotel recovery and hotel industry as they try to get back on their feet. First, how do you think about air capacity? And -- are the airlines going to be even more dependent on leisure travel? Or is there going to be a little bit of a less capacity out there? And then secondly, as the hotels really go-to-market and start filling their rooms, about maybe 2021 or 2022, what advantages -- offering discounts or promotions on booking, could they have versus maybe going to Google or your competitors? How are you thinking about really -- I don't want to say take an advantage, but really, building booking out as a great place to go to find deals and help hotels to find fill inventory? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So two separate things. So the first thing about airlines, and I was just talking about the potential long-term change in business travel, which would, of course, impact the financial structures of a lot of airlines that make a lot of their profits when everybody is up in the front of the plane. And if that's not there, that's not going to happen. On the other hand, though, we'll know that places like Ryanair has been extremely successful in Southwest, extremely essential long-term, without having a very high, very expensive first-class or business class product. Overall, I believe that this could be a change in terms of leisure, it does become more important and that generates tilts favorable to us because we are a more leisure-oriented company.  In terms of the hotels, so I said, I don't -- same type of thing with some of our partners who are more dependent on the business traveler. And as they continue to even come back or cover, it's going to -- for some of them, it's going to be a little bit harder because they're not going to get that very high ADR business person and they will be looking for someone like us. And you mentioned that going to a Google direct or hotels are going to do anything that can way to get me. If it's cost-effective, they will do it. Now over the years, we have established something that actually is more cost effective, that is an easier way and for most of the hotels around the world, they cannot get anywhere near our capabilities to bring them demand around the world. They don't operate in the number of languages we do. They don't do the customer service in those languages. They don't have the sophisticated machine learning. They don't have all the things -- I can list so many that we do, and we do it in a fraction of the cost that will cause them to even try to do that. So it's financially advantageous for them to work with us to get that demand. And as the one of the biggest demand platform in the world for travel, there's no hotel in the world discussing, well, I just don't want to do that. No, they're got to do that. And if there is a marginal benefit to go into another channel to well use that too. But I'm not concerned about hotels not coming to us even more so nowadays. \nJustin Post: Thank you, Glenn.\nOperator:   And your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. \nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks. Two questions, please. Glenn, have you seen any impact from the cut back in performance marketing spend by Expedia in the North American market? Does that -- have you seen any interesting dynamics? Or is the overall just dramatic decline in travel demand, just making that impossible to really call out? And then I want to ask a long-term question about -- I think if you hadn't have COVID this year, there would have been more evidence that booking was building out kind of an operating system for lodging worldwide. I think that was part of your strategy to payments, website development, etcetera. If I interpreted it right, and I think I had -- could you talk about like how much that's been pushed back because of this COVID crisis and your thoughts on if we're -- if we can possibly look out two or three years, how far you are towards building an operating system for lodging and globally? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: HI, Mark. So I can't comment much about Expedia or what they're doing. So I'm sure you see more Google puts out in terms of numbers, etcetera. We're pleased with what we're doing. It's the same strategy that we've had. We're looking to high-quality traffic. We're trying to do it. It's harder now for us just in terms of the miles we use in the past obviously are not as valuable now because cancellations are so affected by government changes. And it's a more difficult thing. We're trying to do it the way we've always done it is not is not doing anything foolish, but I really can't talk about Expedia strategy on what they're doing.  In terms of the operating system, so we're not really building an operating system in terms of going out and trying to build a PMs for hotels. That's not our idea. What we want to do is provide a very integrated benefit for the hotels that makes it so they're getting great value out of things that we're doing with them. So for example, you mentioned the issue of building websites for hotels. That's been pulled back significantly. That was -- some of that is not longer being pushed forward. What we are doing though, is working with them as we build out our connected trip. For example, let's go with a ground transportation and working with them perhaps, in a way that they don't have a way for their customers to get there from the hotel. Well, certainly, we have a way with our customers who come to us first to book, but we can also work with them. So, if a customer booked with some other distributor, not forbid, is correct. We can still create something that would enable them to also be part of that to getting that ground transportation and such. So I think that's more the orientation. Now you talk about how much has been pushed back? Yes, of course, things have been pushed back. And I think that you can always work it by the number of months that we have these kinds of situations with demand so far down is the number of months that we've been pushed back. But I did make that point about -- it was asked about the workforce reduction, the stuff. We're not stopping on investing. We're still investing, and we're still pushing forward to create this connected trip, because that will be our competitive advantage down the road.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks a lot, Glenn.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Powell with Goldman Sachs.\nDaniel Powell: Great, thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I may. On the first, I want to come back to the direct bookings proportion and you said that it was still above 50%. I guess, could you describe some of the puts and takes and reasons that number might not be moving higher for you during this period where suppliers and competitors might be more constrained from a marketing perspective and from a scale perspective?\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So, hypothesize why it's not a higher number. I'm not going to try and do that. I'll say that we're pleased with where we are with our direct bookings. We want to continue to increase it. We've seen our app downloads to be increasing nicely. We'd like -- we've seen that and like that. We're going to continue on the steady pace that we're on. Certainly, we could have increased it, perhaps if we were willing to spend a huge amount of money on brand marketing. But I made the point about why that would not be the most efficient use of our money. It would drive up perhaps the direct bookings a little bit, but at an incredible cost. So, we always want to make sure that we're getting the right bang for our buck, so to speak, and we're pleased with what the pace we're going at.\nDavid Goulden: I'd just add that when things are down on the level they are right now, I mean, we're talking when things are down over 80%. I mean, we're talking about mixed numbers now on a much reduced volume basis. So I think we're going to have to wait and see how it plays out. We're so confident that we're moving in the right direction. And as Glenn said, there are many puts and takes when things are moving as rapidly as they are with volume levels as they are.\nDaniel Powell: Thanks. That's really helpful. And then second one, with the shift to alternative accommodations and the relative strength that you're seeing there in the business. Is there anything from a modeling perspective, we should be looking out for their tailwinds to take rate? Are there higher customer service and payments related costs? Sort of what are some of the things we should look out for there?\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. We've said a couple of things about the alternative accommodation business. As you know, historically, they've had lower operating margins, not because of the take rate difference, but because basically, the reason that you just mentioned. There are typically more touch points, which we've been doing a lot of work to automate. So, we have definitely been working to close that gap and have been closing that gap. And of course, alternative operating, a nice healthy profit margin throughout 2019. So, there are some mix shift differences. There's not a massive gap between the two segments, but there is a difference, mainly again due to touch points, but things we've been working on. So, it's not a trend that we are particularly concerned about. It doesn't, in total, make a big difference to the operating margins.\nDavid Goulden: And as Glenn said, we're uniquely positioned. So, as demand fluctuates, because we believe that this push towards alternative is certainly happening when people are feeling less safe about travel, when people feel more safe about travel, potentially, things might normalize. And then we're in a great position to continue to work on all aspects of the accommodation marketplace.\nGlenn Fogel: And there's one thing long-term that we are thinking deeply about is, because this style of accommodation, has seen this increase, but I would imagine many people have not used it before. And they have now found it to be, it's not so bad, I like this. So in the long run, there could be a lot more demand for this, and sort of, let's say, accelerated trend that can go out for a long time. But what that means, though, there would be a change in the supply side in the long-term. And you'll see many, many people in the accommodation business perhaps who previously had not -- or just dipping their toe and creating this type of accommodation, the combination. We'll be putting investment capital into it and it becomes more and more professionalized. And as this becomes more and more professionalized, that will help lower the frictions, lower those costs and I believe what David was just talking about the difference in terms of the operating margin, and which we've already seen close tremendously will close even more so.\nDaniel Powell: Got it. Thanks so much for the detail.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Evercore ISI. \nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just one, I'm wondering if we could dig in a bit on the July trends across Europe. David, you talked about deterioration plateauing in countries like Spain or Belgium, but you didn't mention any kind of some of the other regions in the area. Is it fair to think that the region as a whole continues to improve? And then, Glenn, you talked about the demand pull forward for alternative accommodations. I guess, is it fair to think that you're looking at this as perhaps a stickier trend, a structural shift that's being perhaps pulled forward from COVID? Or do you think it's mostly just the sign of the times? Thanks so much.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, let me answer the room night growth question trend question firstly. So what we saw in July and Europe was continued improvements. So we saw continued improvement in June and into July in aggregate. As I mentioned, we called out a couple of countries where we are seeing things towards end of July slowdown or go down a little bit. But in aggregate, July was up for newly room nights compared to June in Europe. Whereas in the U.S., the biggest improvement was in June and then things actually basically flattened out in July in the U.S. So Europe where things were still improving in the U.S., they flattened out with June and July being about the same.\nGlenn Fogel: So Lee, I'm not try to say -- I don't think it's a step change, I suppose, but it's just an extension of a long-term trend. And when you think about some of the other trends that have been happening that have been accelerated, the idea of vacations where people say, okay, I don't want to go to work on a Friday. I'm going to take me a long weekend around a place or something like that. And there with so many people who have learned that they can work remotely that increase in that, I'll take Friday off and take -- go down to the beach or get something like ultra recommendation or whatever. I see all those trends accelerating and that really helps that combinations. Because if you're going to take a couple of days away from work, where you are working, but you're not at work, you want something more than a double occupancy, hotel property. You may want a separate room that you can do your work from. So all of these things are coming together, so I think it is something that going to -- it's accelerated already. I think it's going to continue for a long time. And we feel pretty good about the fact that we are very well positioned and continue to grow out our alternative combinations. And at the same time, for the people who want that hotel. They want the resort. They want somebody else changing the sheets, we got that too. So I think for me, we're looking good for the future as travel comes back, which we know it will. It always has, it always will and the more we read about some of these vaccines perhaps coming out in the not-so-distant future, we're pretty positive about the long term.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thank you both.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. So I want to just give you some concluding remarks. And I just have to absolutely thank all of our employees again, they have been working so hard since the beginning of this crisis, helping our partners, helping our customers in these incredibly difficult times, doing it from home. The near-term may be volatile. It's going to be volatile. As I just said, I am so confident, though, about the long-term value proposition that we're putting together. And I'm actually focused on the steps we're taking today to make sure we have a better company tomorrow. Please be safe and good night.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the second quarter and provide some color on the trends we saw through the quarter and into July. All growth rates are relative to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the quarter. In our last earnings call in May, we discussed the trends we saw early in the second quarter, including a year-over-year decline in newly booked room nights of about 85% in April. As a reminder, newly booked room nights excludes the impact of cancellations. April ultimately proved to be the low point for newly booked room night declines in Q2 as we saw a steady improvement in both May and June, driven by increasing levels of domestic travel. Domestic room night declines improved steadily in Europe, North America, and across Asia. However, we saw less improvements in the domestic declines in South America, Middle East, and Africa. Newly booked room nights for the full quarter declined about 68% as we exited the quarter down about 50% in the month of June. Our Q2 reported room nights, which include the impact of cancellations, decreased 87% for the full quarter. Reported room nights in June declined by about 55% and improving from an over 100% decline in April when we receive more cancellations than new bookings. We saw a continued improvement in the cancellation rate since April as we work through the way the cancellations for bookings made prior to COVID-19. Although we're now getting closer to pre-COVID levels of cancellation rates, this improving trend could easily reverse if we see continued outbreak to the virus or new impositions of travel restrictions, especially considering the very high percentage of our recent bookings that are being made with flexible cancellation policies. Gross bookings declined 91% in Q2, which is greater than the decline in reported room nights due to the average daily rates for accommodations of decreasing about 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Note that the high level of cancellations in the quarter significantly distorted ADRs. As a point of comparison, our newly booked ADRs, excluding the impact of cancellations, declined year-over-year by only a couple of percentage points in Q2. And an increasing mix of bookings in the high ADR markets like the U.S. and Western Europe helped largely offset the pressure of the offset the pressure of the broader lodging industry ADR declines. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $630 million and decreased 84% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted than reported at room nights and gross bookings due to the fact that some of the cancellations we received in Q2 were for check-ins are expected to occur in later quarters. This dynamic created by cancellations in the quarter also substantially increased the ratio of revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in the quarter. The substantial the quarter also substantially increased the ratio of revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in the quarter. The substantial reduction in revenue contributed to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $376 million in Q2. While we made significant reductions in our variable expense lines reduction in revenue contributed to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $376 million in Q2. While we made significant reductions in our variable expense lines like marketing, sales and other, our more fixed expenses decreased to a lesser extent in Q2. As we mentioned, we've taken actions across the quarter to reduce operating expenses as we optimize and align our cost structure with the new demand environment. However, the cost benefit of these actions were not fully realized in Q2 and the cost reductions and net restructuring charges are expected to be modest in 2020. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, decreased 85% year-over-year as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we substantially reduced our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. We expect our marketing expenses will remain significantly below 2019 levels for the remainder of the year. Sales and other expenses decreased 47% year-over-year due primarily to a reduction in expenses associated with payment transactions as well as lower outsourced customer service costs as we move through the quarter and needed less support in processing -- reduced level of cancellations in May and June. Bad debt and other credit losses were up about 25% year-over-year in the quarter. However, we saw a far small increase in provisions in Q2 than what we recognized in Q1. We expect sales and other expansion will continue to be down year-on-year in the second half of 2020. However, the extent of the decline will be impacted by level of volume we see in the business. Personnel expenses decreased 18% year-over-year on a non-GAAP basis, primarily due to a $100 million benefit from government aid packages, primarily in the Netherlands and the U.K. Currently, we do not anticipate further material benefits to personnel expenses from government aid in future quarters. We expect personnel expenses in the second half of 2020 will decline less than we saw in Q2 as we'll no longer see the benefit from government aid. We expect the personnel cost reductions we made in Q2 at Agoda, KAYAK and OpenTable, plus the reductions we made early in Q3 of Priceline to produce over $80 million of annualized personnel savings starting in the second half of 2020. As Glenn mentioned, we have further developed our intentions for the appropriate levels of personnel booking.com and are in the process of reviewing these potential reductions with works councils, employee representatives and other organizations. We estimate that the potential cost reduction of Booking.com could produce annual personnel run rate savings between $250 million and $300 million. And because of the processes we have to go through at Booking.com over the next few months, we expect the majority of these savings will not be realized until 2021. As Glenn mentioned, we'll update you on the estimated cost of achieving these savings as soon as they're available, at which time we'll file any required amendments to our 8-K. G&A expenses decreased 43% year-over-year, largely driven by reduced discretionary spend such as T&E and other personnel-related expenses as well as lower office expenses due to employees working remotely. We expect that G&A will continue to be down meaningfully year-over-year in the back half of the year. However, the level of decline may be less than what we saw in the second quarter. Information technology expenses decreased 1% year-over-year due to lower outsourced data center and cloud costs. We expect the IT expenses will remain roughly flat versus the prior year in the back half of the year. Finally, we've broken out restructuring charges separately in the operating expenses in the P&L. The $34 million of restructuring charge to be recorded in the second quarter only relates to the rightsizing activities at KAYAK, OpenTable and Agoda. I note these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results. On a GAAP basis, we incurred an operating loss of $485 million in Q2. We recorded GAAP net income of $122 million in the quarter as we benefited from an $835 million pretax gain on our equity investments, primarily related to our investments in methane. This gain was partially offset by $55 million of FX remeasurement losses on our eurobonds. We excluded these gains and remeasurement losses from our non-GAAP results. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 end cash investment balance increased to $13.4 billion from a March ending balance of $9.2 billion, primarily due to the $4.1 billion bond and convertible note offering we completed in early April. Our long-term investment balances benefited from the $835 million gain on equity investments in the quarter I previously mentioned. These increases to our cash and investment balance were partially offset by the $1.2 billion cash settlements at one of our convertible notes in June. We had $122 million in positive operating cash flow and $52 million in positive free cash flow in the quarter. Change in working capital were a source of about $300 million of cash in the quarter compared to $820 million use of cash in Q1. The improvement from Q1 was largely driven by a Q1 prepayment of taxes in the Netherlands of about $720 million that was subsequently refunded in April. The small reduction in Q2 relative to reduction in Q2 relative to Q1 in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liability balances were mostly offset by a small reduction in our accounts receivable balance in the quarter. Our improvements -- our improved liquidity position is the result of efforts we took to stabilize our business for the immediate shock of the crisis. We'll continue to focus on a strong liquidity position for the immediate shock of the crisis. We'll continue to focus on a strong liquidity position given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. As a part of these efforts to bolster our liquidity and consistent with our clients last quarter, we've halted our approaches of stock and will not initiate repurchases to have better visibility into shape and timing of a recovery. Now on to our thoughts for the third quarter. Consistent with our approach last quarter, I'll not provide full quarterly guidance, but we'll instead provide you with some color on our preliminary July results, which will help you get a better sense of recent top line trends. As Glenn mentioned, our newly booked room nights in July were down about 35% year-over-year. Of course, these new bookings may be counseled in the future, especially as a very high percentage of new bookings continue to be made with flexible cancellation policies. The year-over-year decline in reported room nights in July was about 45%, which is worse than our newly booked room night decline in the month as the cancellation rate remained above prior levels. Bookings for the full third quarter may vary from July's results depending upon the level of travel demand and cancellations we experienced in August and September. We expect gross bookings in the third quarter will decline year-over-year by several percentage points more than our reported room nights due to negative pressure on local currency ADRS. And we expect revenue declines for the quarter will be roughly in line with what we see in gross bookings. We currently expect adjusted EBITDA will be positive in the third quarter, given the trends we're seeing in our business so far through July, as well as the fact that Q3 is our seasonally strongest quarter. This expectation is based on the assumption we do not see a meaningful increase in travel restrictions or shelter in place rules or decrease in consumer willingness to travel as a result of continued or increased core outbreaks in the quarter. As we noticed -- as we noted, we've seen an improvement in our newly book room night trends to continue into July, largely driven by domestic travel. Our newly booked domestic room nights increased slightly year-over-year in the month of July for the first time during the COVID pandemic. Domestic room nights represented over 70% of our newly booked room nights in both Q2 and July, up significantly versus 2019, which was about 45%. Our Booking.com is domestic, alternative accommodation newly booked room nights increased nicely year-over-year in July. And its domestic core accommodation newly booked room nights were down slightly. We continue to monitor other changes in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. We have seen the length of the booking window begin to return to prior year levels in June after expanding versus the prior year in both April and May. Mobile bookings, particularly through our app, continue to gain share in the second quarter into July. And finally, we continue to see greater than 50% of our newly booked room nights coming to us through the direct channel. On a regional basis, Europe and the United States have been the largest contributors for the improvement in newly room night trends since April. However, as Glenn mentioned, in the past weeks, we've witnessed a plateauing or deterioration of new booking trends in several places that have seen increasing outbreaks of COVID-19 cases, including Spain, Belgium, Australia, Japan, Vietnam, Taiwan and the U.S. We've also seen an associated increase in cancellation rates in many of these places. These recent trends are a reminder we're still in the very early days of a fragile recovery that will likely be uneven for some time to come. As Glenn emphasized, this has been a challenging quarter that has involved some very difficult decisions and a number of other actions that will ultimately help us optimize our business with expected level of market demand. We have confidence that through these actions, we'll be well positioned to come out of the crisis and extend our leadership role in the global travel marketplace. With that, we'll now take your questions. So Chris, one of the things I think -- and let me go to the Q2, that 40% number that I gave in my opening remarks, and as we said, that is an increase. It's a big number compared to what we had seen in the past. And it's something that we're pleased. But of course, we all, I think, have a good sense of what's going on. And that is a change in demand because people's concern about being in a large group and a hotel lobby. I think the thing that we really have to think about is what do we think about in the future. Is this a momentary thing? Or is this something that's going to continue long-term or not? And I'll say one thing that we talked about in the past is how we want to continue. We say, this in one for COVID that we want to continue to build our alternative accommodations. Now we thought it was an important thing for us to continue to build out all the types of alternate combinations, and we recognize that we are probably short in certain types, particularly the single property, home type property, and we want to continue to build that. And we also talked that. And we also talked about -- we thought that we were perhaps under-indexing in terms of awareness in certain geographies like the U.S., for example, and we want to continue to improve upon that. So we're going to do that. And we certainly are going to use every single marketing channel we can to get that information out to consumers that we have a great product, and that is something that they can look to us to get a great deal. And that's something that I think is important. I am very pleased, of course, with the numbers we saw, but I also like the fact that we are perhaps the unique in the terms of all the types of combinations we are able to provide all throughout the world. And that's given us, I think, a great opportunity going forward. Yes. And Eric, on the buyback side, just to elaborate a little bit upon what I said. So, I said, we certainly would not initiate and so we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery. So, what do we mean by that? We mean having best certainty as to what the future looks like. And when it's going to happen and what the shape of the recovery is going to look like. Nobody is predicting a V-shaped recovery now. I think that's not what people are looking at, but we're looking at some period of uncertainty right now. Until we figure out more about what's happening with vaccine and how that would impact people's comfort. And then, of course, is the economic impact of the COVID prices and what that does to people's ability to travel and spend money, so all these things go into it. So, there's not a single milestone to look for. But if you ask me to characterize the environment, which we will consider, reinitiating capital returns, it would be an environment where we have much more visibility and confidence into the shape of the future. I think, Glenn, as we said, we continue to be over 50% direct. But I think there are some important things that are driving that, which are good indicators. And we mentioned them briefly a little bit on the last call as well. I mentioned in my remarks earlier that we continue to see the app being an important contribution because that is really our stickiest kind of touch point with our customers because that is not only a place you go to book travel, but increasingly, it's way interact with us during the travel experience, which is very important as well. And we also see, as we mentioned last quarter, we also see things like an increasing percentage mix from our Genius customers as well, this quarter as well. So these are positive things correlate long-term to a higher mix of direct bookings and just this ability to create, as Glenn has said a few times, the connected chip, where you're not just booking with us and then going on the trip, but you're really booking multi verticals. You're interacting with us during the trip, we're providing things like dynamic customer support, et cetera, a very different environment in the future, which is obviously powered by big data, machine learning, AI, et cetera. So, we think these are important signs that we're moving in the right direction. I'm going to ask you to clarify the second part, Deepak, let me ask -- answer the first part. So yes, there's obviously many moving parts with ADRs this quarter. And as I mentioned, for newly booked room nights, the ADRs actually, in total, only off a couple of points, even though there's a mix shift, obviously, within that too domestic. So we see a number of things going on. What we see is in some case, obviously, some people are substituting what would have been an international booking for a domestic booking, and those can potentially be higher ADRs because historically, international travel typically resulted in a higher ADR and longer stay. And to the extent that some of that is substituting into domestic, that could be helping our ADRs on a country-by-country basis because in some of our core countries in Europe, we actually saw ADRs up quite meaningfully in the quarter. So there's a number of mix related things going on within the whole ADR environment. And as I said, essentially flat, just down a couple of points in total in the quarter despite the fact that we know that like-for-like, there are certainly ADR pressures in the marketplace. And Deepak, I missed the second part of your question, could you just repeat that, please? No, no, we took -- well, in terms of -- well, no, there's still going to be an ADR pressure on that. So what we said was we're down 35 in July in room nights on a newly booked basis, down 45 on a reported basis, the cancellation rates running a little higher than they were last year. And then a few points more than that down in terms of gross bookings and revenue. Why don't you take the first one, and I'll take the second. Yes. And on the cost side of things. So yes, we said the majority of the personnel reductions will be in volume-related functions. Obviously, that will -- those will, over time, come back. We look to continue to drive efficiency in many of those areas through our business, over time through automation and other areas. So they don't necessarily have to come back for job as volume return, they will come back. And in terms of our expectation for the longer-term when we get to pre-COVID levels, which as we said, is not about quarters but is about years. We expect the business to have a very attractive margins when demand fully recovers. All things being equal, we expect to have industry-leading margins in the long-term. Obviously, the business in the future will look a little different than it did pre-COVID. For example, we're building out new products like air which will be dilutive to margin rate, but will also be important to our business and our strategy in the connected trip and selling more accommodations. So there'll be puts and takes, but we expect to have industry-leading margins in the longer term. I'd just add that when things are down on the level they are right now, I mean, we're talking when things are down over 80%. I mean, we're talking about mixed numbers now on a much reduced volume basis. So I think we're going to have to wait and see how it plays out. We're so confident that we're moving in the right direction. And as Glenn said, there are many puts and takes when things are moving as rapidly as they are with volume levels as they are. And as Glenn said, we're uniquely positioned. So, as demand fluctuates, because we believe that this push towards alternative is certainly happening when people are feeling less safe about travel, when people feel more safe about travel, potentially, things might normalize. And then we're in a great position to continue to work on all aspects of the accommodation marketplace. Yes, let me answer the room night growth question trend question firstly. So what we saw in July and Europe was continued improvements. So we saw continued improvement in June and into July in aggregate. As I mentioned, we called out a couple of countries where we are seeing things towards end of July slowdown or go down a little bit. But in aggregate, July was up for newly room nights compared to June in Europe. Whereas in the U.S., the biggest improvement was in June and then things actually basically flattened out in July in the U.S. So Europe where things were still improving in the U.S., they flattened out with June and July being about the same."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We felt the full impact of COVID-19 during the second quarter, with reported room nights, which includes the impact of cancellations, declining 87% year-over-year. Newly book room nights, excluding the impact of cancellations, declined 68% in the quarter. The high cancellation rate of pre-COVID bookings, which we witnessed in March and April, combined with the overall weak travel demand environment, significantly impacted our revenue and EBITDA this quarter. Revenue declined 84% versus last year, and we recorded an adjusted EBITDA loss of $376 million. The first time we have produced a quarterly EBITDA loss since 2001. We witnessed the greatest negative impact from the virus in April is newly booked room nights in that month declined over 85% year-over-year. After April, room night trends have steadily improved with newly booked room nights in July, declining about 35% year-over-year. The improved booking trends were primarily driven by domestic travel with international trends, seeing much more limited improvement. In July, we reached slightly positive year-over-year growth or overall domestic newly book room nights, though, of course, there are many countries that still have negative year-over-year growth rates. In addition, it is an obvious point that our domestic business is benefiting from prohibitions and restrictions on international travel, which forces consumers who want a holiday to travel domestically. While almost all of our global markets showed improvement through the quarter, Europe and the United States had the highest contribution to the improved domestic booking trends. As a reminder, a very high percentage of our new bookings have been made with flexible cancellation policies and may be canceled in the future. And as we see, new outbreaks of COVID-19 and cancellations may increase again. While we are pleased to see signs of recovery in domestic travel, we want to emphasize that it is impossible to tell how the coming months will unfold. Unfortunately, many areas of the world continue to have very high infection rates. And in some regions, they are dealing with new outbreaks after having significantly lowered their infection rates. As a result, after a period of relatively steady improvement in many geographies, in recent weeks, we are seeing these growth rates worsen in some countries. We continue to believe that in order to recover to pre-COVID levels, we will need to have a vaccine or effective treatment, which will take time to produce and distribute globally at the scale needed. We are pleased to have recently read news about progress on this front. But we believe it will be years and not quarters before the travel market returns to pre-COVID volumes. In those countries and regions where shelter-in-place rules were relaxed and economies reopened, we witnessed booking trends improve quickly. We believe part of this initial burst of demand is due to people's pent-up desire to go somewhere after being in a lockdown situation. It also demonstrates people's deep desire to travel, providing it to safe. Throughout this initial reopening phase, we have seen new customer booking and travel patterns emerge. In line with our growth in domestic travel, we are seeing that bookers are choosing to stay closer to home, and are more interested in less urban areas than pre-COVID. The share of these types of bookings on our platform has increased meaningfully this quarter. We also see that our customers are booking more alternative accommodations than in the past, which often have the benefit of reduced potential interaction with other travelers. In Q2, Booking.com, alternative accommodations represented about 40% of all new bookings in the quarter. We've all seen an increase in travelers booking stays with more flexible cancellation policies due to the uncertain travel environment we currently face. Our platform is well-positioned to capture these travel demand patterns due to our very capable marketing teams, global footprint, extensive accommodation choice and diversification of cancellation policy and rate types. We have adapted our marketplace to operate more efficiently in this new travel demand environment to benefit both our supply partners and customers. We are working closely with our supply partners, so they can more effectively market on our platform to capture the growing travel demand. As our partners seek assistance to better respond to these new domestic and intra-regional demand patterns, we are working to provide more information, and it wise as to the nature of the demand and offering the best programs on our platform that will help them capture this demand. We are also helping our partners more effectively communicate and showcase the steps that they have taken to increase their own health and safety protocols at their properties. Something we know travelers are keen to understand, in order to make informed booking decisions. Finally, we continue to extend our payments platform to more of our supply partners, and it remains a key initiative for us this year. Developing merchant capabilities has valuable benefits for both our supply partners and bookers. As we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, we articulated a series of plans to help navigate the company through these challenging times. First phase was focused on stabilizing the business in the initial stages of the crisis, which included supporting our employees and increasing our cash position. The second phase was focused on optimizing the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years. The final phase is focused on positioning the business to capture travel demand as it develops, so that we can emerge from the crisis on a strong footing and extend our leadership position. We completed the stabilization phase and are now working through our optimization phase. These actions have allowed us to lay the important groundwork that will set us up to emerge from pandemic in a position of strength. During our optimization phase, we assessed our total cost structure and develop plans to align it with expected market demand over the next few quarters. We completed this work at KAYAK, OpenTable and Agoda in the second quarter, and recently completed in a Priceline in July. The restructuring charge we took in the second quarter only relates to the rightsizing activities at KAYAK, OpenTable and Agora. These actions had the effect of reducing headcount by approximately 22% across these brands, including some including some furloughed employees. While the cost savings net of restructuring costs will be modest this year, we expect that these cost reductions will produce over $80 million of annual personnel savings. With respect to Booking.com, we have further developed our intentions for the appropriate level of personnel and other cost reductions in light of expected business loss. Booking.com is in the process of consulting with its works councils and employee representatives and working through local labor regulations in the countries where we operate. We hope to finalize our plans and to have more definitive news over the coming months. We expect that up to about 25% of Booking.com's global workforce could be impacted by these actions. We expect that business functions most closely tied to its transaction volumes will be impacted the most. At this time, and subject to our consultation with the Dutch Works Council, employee representatives and other organizations, we estimate that these cost reductions at Booking.com could produce annual personnel savings between $250 million to $300 million. This preliminary estimate may change and we will update you in the coming months on the expected restructuring costs associated with these reductions. It is our hope to make all announcements to employees about these cost reductions by the end of 2020. In conclusion, we have learned from when we could not travel, how important travel is to our lives, whether to see family or friends, or to explore new places and cultures, travel is fundamental to who we are. Our Wish List Campaign, which drew on insights from millions customers like accommodations they would want to visit, affirm the innate desire or demand that will always endure forward travel. This campaign reiterates the energy and passion that we know remains for travel. This has been a challenging quarter and we've had to make some very difficult decisions. We believe it will take years for travel to fully recover, but I have great confidence in our employees and our capabilities and I cannot be more proud of how our entire team has handled themselves during these trying times. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. Hi, Kevin. It's Glenn. No, we don't go around trying to at what we think our share is up or down. Obviously, you probably have a very good idea to what you think of our competitors and where they are. I will say what David said is, we are pleased with what we saw in July. What I think what's very, very important that everybody, keep in mind that this is a very volatile recovery and the countries that David went out and listed that we have seen increased outbreaks. That was not a complete list. We'd use up the entire time if we listed every single place that have seen places that are suddenly having increases in COVID. So I would caution, again, just what David said, yes, we were pleased with what we saw in July. But we have to be careful about the future. Yes. Kevin, we gave you two numbers. We gave you $80 million annualized for the brand apart from Booking.com. And then $250 million to $300 million for the potential savings of Booking.com based upon all the process points that we talked about. So those would directly impact the personnel line. So those we've broken out. We mentioned in some -- many other areas of the business, our expenses are down, but we haven't really work through all the details exactly what those are going to be is we are focused upon our employ our employee-related costs first. But obviously, with less people, there will be less expenses to come with it in other areas. And as we work through those plans as well, we'll make them available. But the biggest change is going to be to personnel cost. Well, I think, I'll confine myself saying, look, we're always looking for high-quality traffic at the right price. Now when I say, high-quality, they want to convert well, one of the low probability of cancellation, I wanted to come back to us later directly. And that's what we're going to continue to do and we've always done that. And that's no change from our previous way to run our business. Alex, you say -- so you're asking what is our -- just in general, you're saying -- again, our go-to-market in the U.S., you're saying? Yes. Okay. So, we have said this in the past and I'll repeat clearly more so now. We think the U.S. is a great opportunity for us. We think we under index, we've got a great partners. I was just saying, all types of accommodations. And with what we're building with our connected trip, we think we're going to offer an incredible value proposition to consumers. So we are absolutely excited about the long-term future of Liz right now. Yes, people are traveling a little bit more, certainly than they were in April. But we all know what the situation is right now. And what you don't want to be doing is spending a lot of money pushing out a brand message, if people are not hearing -- are not listening to it, because they are not ready to travel or they can't travel. So we want to be careful about that. So I think we're going to have to wait. And so we have a healthier environment, where people -- more people are ready to listen to that message, before we're going to start spending money on it. So we made very clear in our discussions with our employees, our works council, our employee organizations. And everyone have to have these conversations with. As you know, there are different regulations around the world in terms of potential conversation to have. We made it very clear that the higher wage is going to be on volume-related positions, because our volumes are way down. Those are the ones. And I made it very clear how much I believe in the future of the connected trend, the investments we're making, the things that we believe in the long-term will give us a competitive advantage over everybody. And I would -- I think, I'd be doing the wrong thing, if I was saying, we should stop trying to invest in those areas. I think they're important for the long run. And, yes, this is a terrible time right now. And yes, our financials are being hurt by this. That, to me, does not mean we should stop investing in our future. Sure. I'll take the first one and I'll let Dave talk about our potential capital return at some point, balance sheet in general. So one thing we've talked about in the past a great deal is, if there was a recession, what's going to happen in terms of the supply relations. Would they be more willing to lean in with us? Would they be more open to conversations? What will they do? And what we've been seeing, and it's pretty much what we thought would happen is that, when demand goes away and supply is looking for demand, they're looking to do it any way they can and they are open to conversation that perhaps they weren't in the past. So our teams are out there talking with on the supply side and whether it be alternative accommodations, properties or in the big hotel tans or anybody who is in our business. Right now, they need demand, and they're looking for can you supply to me. So our teams are coming up with creative in different ways to try and provide something that will help them because we now look, we this number two sided marketplace. We got to do good for both sides. And that's what we're doing right now and I think we're making progress with it. We're having some very good conversations that may not have had in the past. But I think that in the future, we will hopefully have this be a long-term better relationship with some of our partners as we continue to develop ways that we show their win-win for everybody. Sure. So we've said this and we will continue to say how important we believe is direct booking is really where we want to be in the future is provide such great value than our customers, once they learn about this, they come back to us directly. They don't want to think about going somewhere else. And such great value that our customers once they learn about this by, they come back to us directly. They don't want to think about going somewhere else. And through the connected trip and building up all different types of, let's say, lower friction type ways to travel. That it makes it so that we are the first thought always. I'm not sure, David, if you want to give me more color to where we are now. I'll let him do it. But I will say the system is important to us. It's a country domestic. We do -- we sometime look at our region, Intra regional. But if you're an Italian tourist and you went to France, that's not a domestic travel. I'm looking at David, just to confirm. Yes. So in terms of profile, I have not looked in any sort of customer segmentation recently in terms of the write-down. So I can't speak specifically in terms of deep debt on the profiles. But I would say that it would not surprise me if I did it now next week, it will show not that different in terms of what it was pre-COVID. People still want to travel, people still sometimes have to travel, and sometimes do it voluntarily, but the shape is -- the change is where they're traveling and how they're traveling. So, for example, because people can, as I mentioned, you can't travel internationally from the U.S. to Europe, let's say, what is happening, those people are traveling domestically. And we've seen that in terms of people very much wanting to travel close to home at first, because they want to be able to drive there, because concerned about getting on a plane. But in terms of the actual different types of customers within it, I don't think I've seen much of anything, except for one thing that I think is very, very critical to talk about, and that is business travel. Now we have always been a much more leisure oriented company. And we all know from the businesses that we work in that business travel has been significantly curtailed or stopped? And what does that do? Well, certain properties, certain supply chain, for example, high-end hints that are no longer able to get that high ADR revenue. And that, of course, is helping in terms of a distributor like us because we have leisure customers to help fill those things. Now how long will this go? This is a long-term trend. I think that this could be helpful to us, and may be helpful to us in the long-term. As the shift from business to leisure continues for a long time, we will be in a better position with our supply partners because we're able to provide them with what they need, which is heads and beds. Yes. So two separate questions. So in terms of, again, we're having our conversations with our important partners, works councils, employee organizations, et cetera, and having going through this site Booking.com. And the key thing we mentioned is how a lot of this is volume related. So where the volume is most effective areas are going to end up having a higher weighted impact. That's just the way it's obviously going to happen. I don't think you can -- we certainly are not purposely coming with a strategy change. We believe that it's important for us to be able to provide travel services throughout the world, as the leader in the world, we want to maintain that. In terms of our regular amusement, I think that's what you're talking about Kiwi, correct? Right. So we think attractions is an important part of our connected trip theory and strategy that we've talked about. And the faster we can get different types of attractions up and running and available to our customers the better. However, we do the connection ourselves, where we go out, we partner with somebody or we buy somebody, whatever it is, we want to get that stuff up, so we can provide that value. And [indiscernible] is a great partner. They had proposition. We decide to join up. And we are now live in a certain number of cities, and we are going to continue to build that out. And I believe that this is one of the things that will help really provide value. When somebody is traveling, they use that app that David mentioned, more people use the app. And when you're in a location and you're able, just one touch be able to go to an attraction. I think that's a convenience, and we'll be able that value, a price differential. I think that, again, will give us a competitive advantage, but we're going to have the supply first, of course. Yes. So two separate things. So the first thing about airlines, and I was just talking about the potential long-term change in business travel, which would, of course, impact the financial structures of a lot of airlines that make a lot of their profits when everybody is up in the front of the plane. And if that's not there, that's not going to happen. On the other hand, though, we'll know that places like Ryanair has been extremely successful in Southwest, extremely essential long-term, without having a very high, very expensive first-class or business class product. Overall, I believe that this could be a change in terms of leisure, it does become more important and that generates tilts favorable to us because we are a more leisure-oriented company.  In terms of the hotels, so I said, I don't -- same type of thing with some of our partners who are more dependent on the business traveler. And as they continue to even come back or cover, it's going to -- for some of them, it's going to be a little bit harder because they're not going to get that very high ADR business person and they will be looking for someone like us. And you mentioned that going to a Google direct or hotels are going to do anything that can way to get me. If it's cost-effective, they will do it. Now over the years, we have established something that actually is more cost effective, that is an easier way and for most of the hotels around the world, they cannot get anywhere near our capabilities to bring them demand around the world. They don't operate in the number of languages we do. They don't do the customer service in those languages. They don't have the sophisticated machine learning. They don't have all the things -- I can list so many that we do, and we do it in a fraction of the cost that will cause them to even try to do that. So it's financially advantageous for them to work with us to get that demand. And as the one of the biggest demand platform in the world for travel, there's no hotel in the world discussing, well, I just don't want to do that. No, they're got to do that. And if there is a marginal benefit to go into another channel to well use that too. But I'm not concerned about hotels not coming to us even more so nowadays. HI, Mark. So I can't comment much about Expedia or what they're doing. So I'm sure you see more Google puts out in terms of numbers, etcetera. We're pleased with what we're doing. It's the same strategy that we've had. We're looking to high-quality traffic. We're trying to do it. It's harder now for us just in terms of the miles we use in the past obviously are not as valuable now because cancellations are so affected by government changes. And it's a more difficult thing. We're trying to do it the way we've always done it is not is not doing anything foolish, but I really can't talk about Expedia strategy on what they're doing.  In terms of the operating system, so we're not really building an operating system in terms of going out and trying to build a PMs for hotels. That's not our idea. What we want to do is provide a very integrated benefit for the hotels that makes it so they're getting great value out of things that we're doing with them. So for example, you mentioned the issue of building websites for hotels. That's been pulled back significantly. That was -- some of that is not longer being pushed forward. What we are doing though, is working with them as we build out our connected trip. For example, let's go with a ground transportation and working with them perhaps, in a way that they don't have a way for their customers to get there from the hotel. Well, certainly, we have a way with our customers who come to us first to book, but we can also work with them. So, if a customer booked with some other distributor, not forbid, is correct. We can still create something that would enable them to also be part of that to getting that ground transportation and such. So I think that's more the orientation. Now you talk about how much has been pushed back? Yes, of course, things have been pushed back. And I think that you can always work it by the number of months that we have these kinds of situations with demand so far down is the number of months that we've been pushed back. But I did make that point about -- it was asked about the workforce reduction, the stuff. We're not stopping on investing. We're still investing, and we're still pushing forward to create this connected trip, because that will be our competitive advantage down the road. Yes. So, hypothesize why it's not a higher number. I'm not going to try and do that. I'll say that we're pleased with where we are with our direct bookings. We want to continue to increase it. We've seen our app downloads to be increasing nicely. We'd like -- we've seen that and like that. We're going to continue on the steady pace that we're on. Certainly, we could have increased it, perhaps if we were willing to spend a huge amount of money on brand marketing. But I made the point about why that would not be the most efficient use of our money. It would drive up perhaps the direct bookings a little bit, but at an incredible cost. So, we always want to make sure that we're getting the right bang for our buck, so to speak, and we're pleased with what the pace we're going at. Yes. We've said a couple of things about the alternative accommodation business. As you know, historically, they've had lower operating margins, not because of the take rate difference, but because basically, the reason that you just mentioned. There are typically more touch points, which we've been doing a lot of work to automate. So, we have definitely been working to close that gap and have been closing that gap. And of course, alternative operating, a nice healthy profit margin throughout 2019. So, there are some mix shift differences. There's not a massive gap between the two segments, but there is a difference, mainly again due to touch points, but things we've been working on. So, it's not a trend that we are particularly concerned about. It doesn't, in total, make a big difference to the operating margins. And there's one thing long-term that we are thinking deeply about is, because this style of accommodation, has seen this increase, but I would imagine many people have not used it before. And they have now found it to be, it's not so bad, I like this. So in the long run, there could be a lot more demand for this, and sort of, let's say, accelerated trend that can go out for a long time. But what that means, though, there would be a change in the supply side in the long-term. And you'll see many, many people in the accommodation business perhaps who previously had not -- or just dipping their toe and creating this type of accommodation, the combination. We'll be putting investment capital into it and it becomes more and more professionalized. And as this becomes more and more professionalized, that will help lower the frictions, lower those costs and I believe what David was just talking about the difference in terms of the operating margin, and which we've already seen close tremendously will close even more so. So Lee, I'm not try to say -- I don't think it's a step change, I suppose, but it's just an extension of a long-term trend. And when you think about some of the other trends that have been happening that have been accelerated, the idea of vacations where people say, okay, I don't want to go to work on a Friday. I'm going to take me a long weekend around a place or something like that. And there with so many people who have learned that they can work remotely that increase in that, I'll take Friday off and take -- go down to the beach or get something like ultra recommendation or whatever. I see all those trends accelerating and that really helps that combinations. Because if you're going to take a couple of days away from work, where you are working, but you're not at work, you want something more than a double occupancy, hotel property. You may want a separate room that you can do your work from. So all of these things are coming together, so I think it is something that going to -- it's accelerated already. I think it's going to continue for a long time. And we feel pretty good about the fact that we are very well positioned and continue to grow out our alternative combinations. And at the same time, for the people who want that hotel. They want the resort. They want somebody else changing the sheets, we got that too. So I think for me, we're looking good for the future as travel comes back, which we know it will. It always has, it always will and the more we read about some of these vaccines perhaps coming out in the not-so-distant future, we're pretty positive about the long term. Thank you. So I want to just give you some concluding remarks. And I just have to absolutely thank all of our employees again, they have been working so hard since the beginning of this crisis, helping our partners, helping our customers in these incredibly difficult times, doing it from home. The near-term may be volatile. It's going to be volatile. As I just said, I am so confident, though, about the long-term value proposition that we're putting together. And I'm actually focused on the steps we're taking today to make sure we have a better company tomorrow. Please be safe and good night."

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We are living in difficult times. Since our last call in February, the spread of COVID-19 has grown exponentially, bringing uncertainty, turmoil [Technical Difficulty] ever seen. Billions of people have been under stay-at-home orders, and there have been and continue to be closures of orders, government enforce travel restrictions and strict guidelines regarding social distancing. These actions have profoundly affected our industry in every corner of this [indiscernible]. While our Q1 reported room nights declined 43% year-over-year, we did not see the virus' full negative force on our business until mid- to late March. So the 43% decline does not truly reflect the state of our business nor the travel industry today. In March, our reported room nights declined over 100%, meaning we received more cancellations during that month in new bookings.  Looking at things a different way. Our newly booked room nights, which exclude the impact of cancellations, were down over 60% year-over-year in March and down over 85% in April. This gives you a clear indication of how much our business is currently impacted by this crisis. That being said, while the virus impact on travel is unprecedented, I am confident that this crisis will eventually end and people will travel again. Travel is fundamental to who we are. And while it may take some time to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, we will get there eventually. And then we'd expect travel to continue to grow thereafter.  So what are we doing now as we wait for effective treatments for a successful vaccine? During the first quarter, when it became clear that the virus impact was going to be more significant than anyone initially anticipated, we quickly developed a series of plans to help us navigate through these challenging times. One, stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis; two, optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years; and three, position the business to capture travel demand when it returns. So we can emerge from this crisis on strong footing and extend our leadership position.  As we entered the stabilization phase at the beginning of the crisis, our employees' health and safety was a top priority. But what we have -- although we have a few offices currently open in Asia, the vast majority of our employees are now working from home, including our customer service teams, which is no small accomplishment considering the technology requirements and the huge increase in change requests and cancellations that we experienced. I am very proud of our teams and pleased to say that we are functioning well in this new distributed environment.  Another immediate priority was helping our customers and our supply partners. For a number of weeks, we were fielding a significantly higher number of daily inbound calls than we typically received. For our customers, this entailed supporting them as they sought refunds from bookings that were no longer possible due to government regulations or made requests to modify their travel plans. For our partners, many of whom do not have the ability to process such a large volume of customer service calls, we supported them by handling the unprecedented level of cancellations and date modifications request.  Looking ahead, we'll be working with our trial partners to create plans to stimulate trial orders to book again once this crisis is behind us. We know how critical it will be to bring demand to our supply partners in a cost-effective way. Also as part of our stabilization plan, we took immediate steps to conserve cash and increase liquidity such as halting stock buybacks, dramatically reducing marketing spend worldwide, cutting nonessential costs, implementing a general hire increase and reducing executive compensation, with our brand CEOs and I forgoing salaries during this crisis, and the other senior managers throughout the company voluntarily reducing their base salaries and our Board of Directors forgoing their cash fees. In addition to reducing costs, we bolstered our liquidity by raising over $4 billion in debt. These measures have enabled us to have sufficient liquidity to weather a long period of significantly reduced travel demand and have the necessary resources to invest in securing demand when people are ready to travel again.  We've now begun to refine and execute our optimized plan in which we will adapt to the new reality that assumes it will be -- likely be years, not quarters, before we witness a full recovery of global travel demand. We believe that either a vaccine or effective treatment is needed before people will feel fully comfortable traveling the way they did before the pandemic started. And even after our vaccine or treatment is declared safe and effective, we believe it may be some time before there is efficient quantity and distribution to them to give people and governments confidence for people to travel freely. Furthermore, as in pre-COVID-19 days, that will be dependent on the overall economy, consumers' financial health having gone through a very deep recession and consumers' confidence in their own economic futures. For these reasons, we expect travel to fully recover a leader than many other industries. However, when travel demand does start to recover, we believe there'll be attractive growth opportunities.  We are in the process of assessing the cost structure of our entire company in helping plans to align it with expected market demand. As part of these efforts, we're also evaluating our strategic initiatives and the timing of significant expenditures. We intend to continue to invest in our key projects, such as payments, in the connected trip that we believe will position us well for the future. But we are also reexamining all areas of the company to see where can we reduce or delay cost where possible. Fortunately, our financial strength allows us to make strategic decisions oriented towards the long-term interest of the business. We recently completed a strategic evaluation on OpenTable and KAYAK, announcing last week a series of actions to reduce operating costs. Unfortunately, this included the decision to lay off and furlough some employees. As a principle during this crisis, we have not reached first for employee reductions to lower costs. But after making adjustments in other operating expense areas, we made the tough decision to ensure the size and scope of our business is proportionate to the new realities of the travel market. We are now working with the other brands to examine their cost structures, and we will be thoughtful and deliberate in our evaluations.  In an attempt to minimize the impact on our employees during these difficult times, we have been evaluating and employing various governmental financial support programs. Booking.com recently announced that it would participate in the employee aid program offered by the United Kingdom. And we were able to place employees on furlough there, which has enabled employees to receive a significant portion of their full-time salary. We have also applied to the Dutch government 15E under the recently enacted program to support employment in the Netherlands. This program provides funds to Dutch companies impacted by this crisis and covers a portion of employee salaries for a 3-month period with the requirement that companies which receive this aid maintain employment during the time the aid is provided. These programs, along with all the other steps we have taken, will help us support employees and maintain jobs as we continue to fully evaluate the operating environment. We will continue to look at other available options that might help us mitigate near-term headcount reductions during this period of significantly reduced revenue.  The actions we are taking are stabilization and optimization phases are being done so that we can capitalize quickly and efficiently on travel demand when it becomes safe for people to travel again. We want to emerge from this crisis and a strong organization that is equipped to deliver for our customers and our partners will capitalize and in a position to increase our market share when the world is ready to travel again.  On a smaller but somewhat positive note, we are seeing some stability in our newly booked room night growth trends. We hope that this is the beginning of the road back to recovery, but it is simply too early to say with certainty. Some governments have seen progress in limiting or reducing the pandemic. They have slowly begun to reopen their economies, and we have seen new bookings, primarily for domestic travel, although still at very low levels. Some or many of these reservations may ultimately be canceled, but we believe it does show that travel for essential business and personal reasons will slowly return as society makes progress against the pandemic. As travel returns, we expect to see improvement in our revenue.  We are also prepared for disruption in that progress as relaxation of social distancing in some geographies may lead to a resurgence of infections and reinstatement of government restrictions. Our aim is to optimize the business to participate in the ultimate return of demand [Technical Difficulty].\nDavid Goulden: Hello are we still on the line?\nOperator: Yes, one moment, please.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you. Hello, operator, can you hear me?\nOperator: Yes, I can hear you.\nDavid Goulden: Okay. Am I live on the line?\nOperator: Yes, you are.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. Operator, am I on the line? Can you confirm that, please? I can...\nOperator: Yes, you are, sir.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the first quarter, discuss our stabilization initiative to bolster our liquidity and provide some color on trends we saw in April. All growth rates related to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.  Now on to our results for the quarter. At the time of our last earnings call on February 26, the outbreak of COVID-19 was largely contained to Asia, and we're yet to see a meaningful impact in our business across Europe or North America. As we moved into March, the COVID outbreak continues to spread throughout Europe and North America, leading to the eventual declaration of a global pandemic and the implementation of numerous travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. Not surprisingly, we saw a resulting sharp duration of our top line trends in March with significant levels of cancellations and a substantial reduction in the level of new bookings. Although we only felt the full brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic around mid- to late March, our Q1 results were still significantly negatively impacted.  Our Q1 reported room nights declined 43% for the fourth quarter. However, that decline exceeded 100% in March, we received more cancellation of the new bookings in the month. Our cancellation rate peaked in mid-March, has been steadily improving then as we work through the way the cancellation of bookings made prior to the imposition of restrictions on travel. Gross bookings declined 51% in Q1, which is a greater decline than reported room nights due to average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Consolidated non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter was $2.3 billion and decreased 21% year-on-year. Revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted the room nights and gross bookings due to the fact that many cancellations were received in Q1 were checks -- that were expected to occur later -- were expect to occur in later quarters. Adjusted Q1 for EBITDA was $290 million, which was down 60% year-on-year. We benefit from having a highly variable cost structure that naturally declines in periods of low travel demand. As Glenn noted, we are taking further actions in reducing other areas of spend as we stabilize and then move to optimize and line our cost structure with the new demand environment. With that being said, there were some areas of expense pressure in the quarter related to COVID-19 pandemic that I'll walk you through.  Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense, decreased 29% year-on-year, as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we took actions to substantially reduce our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. We expect our marketing expense will remain significantly below 2019 levels for the remainder of the year. Sales and other expenses increased 75% year-on-year due primarily to $183 million increase in provisions for expected bad debt and other credit losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Excluding the impact of the increased provision we recorded in the quarter, sales and other decreased 10% year-on-year as this expense line is substantially variable in nature. For example, we recorded lower expenses associated with payments in Q1. This reduction was partially offset by higher outsourced customer service costs as we work through the heavy volume of cancellations we received in the quarter. Personnel expense decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation which was impacted by reduced financial performance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding SBC expenses, personnel increased 12% year-over-year and although we have implemented a hiring freeze, personnel expense this quarter was impacted by annualized hires that were made last year. We expect the pressure on personnel expense will diminish as we move through the year.  G&A expenses increased 6% year-over-year largely driven by higher indirect taxes, including digital service taxes. Excluding these indirect taxes, G&A expense decreased 7% year-over-year as we reduced discretionary expenses such as G&A expense. We will see less year-over-year pressure on G&A from digital service taxes once we lap the enactments of the French DST, which occurred in Q3 of last year.  Finally, information technology expenses increased 20% year-on-year, driven by higher software fees and outsourced data center and cloud costs. On a GAAP basis, we incurred an operating loss of $308 million as our GAAP operating expenses in the quarter included a charge of $489 million related to an impairment of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK. This impairment charge is driven by a reduced financial projections as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We excluded the impairment of goodwill for our non-GAAP results. Our Q1 GAAP net loss was $699 million. Our Q1 GAAP net loss includes $307 million of pretax losses on our equity investments in Trip.com and Meituan and the $100 million impairment charge related to our strategic investments. This was partially offset by $33 million of FX remeasurement gains on our euro bonds. We exclude these unrealized losses, impairment charge and remeasurement gains from our non-GAAP results.  Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance was $9.2 billion, which decreased from our December ending balance by $11.8 billion due to several factors, including the following primary drivers. First, we had $380 million of operating cash outflow in the quarter, which was driven by an $820 million use of cash due to change in working capital as well as the lower earnings we generated in the quarter. Working capital in Q1 was negatively impacted by a prepayment of tax rate in the Netherlands of 719 -- $717 million that was subsequently refunded in April. The large reductions in our deferred merchant bookings, accounts payable and accrued expenses balances were mostly offset by the significant reduction in our accounts receivable balance in Q1. The deferred merchant booking reduction was driven by both lower bookings and customer refunds. We expect these balances will all continue to decline in the low level of bookings we are currently seeing in the business.  Second, we repurchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q1, almost all of which was purchased under a stock buyback plan we filed last November. We halted buybacks as soon as we recognize the growing impact of the pandemic. Third, we had CapEx of $80 million in the quarter. And finally, the value of our investments decline in parts by the $307 million unrealized loss on equity securities and the $100 million impairment related to a strategic investment that I mentioned earlier. In addition, we had $106 million decline in investment value that did not impact the P&L but was reflected in the balance sheet. The majority of the remaining $288 million difference between cash and investments at year-end on March 31, is primarily due to the timing of the settlement of sales was from corporate bonds that were classified in prepaid expenses and other assets at the end of March. These sales have settled in April and moved into cash and investments.  In our efforts to stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis, we've taken several steps to show up and bolster our liquidity position. We halted repurchase of our stock, and we will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We worked to receive a refund in April of the prepayment of taxes in the Netherlands that was made early in Q1. We amended our revolving credit facility to substitute a minimum liquidity covenants for the previous leverage covenants due in June 21 to ensure we continue to have access to the source of liquidity. And finally, and most notably, we completed a bond and convertible note offering on April 8 that raised $4.1 billion of capital.  If you adjust our March 31 ending cash investment balance of $9.2 billion for our bond and convertible note offering and the settlement of the corporate bond sales and the refund of the Dutch tax prepayments, all of which occurred in April, on March 31, cash and investment balance will increase to about $14.3 billion. Approximately $12 billion of this is highly liquid after considering the actions we've taken, including recently completing the sale of our trip.com ADSs, moving on cash and investments into corporate -- moving on cash and investments in corporate bonds into AAA treasury and government money market funds. After the bond and convertible offering, we have about $13 billion of debt, $4 billion of which matures before the end of 2022.  Due to the COVID-19 crisis, I will not provide quarterly guidance like we normally do. However, I will provide some color from our preliminary April results, which will give you a clear picture of our recent top line trends considering that April was the first month fully impacted by the pandemic. As Glenn mentioned, our newly booked room nights in April were down over 85% year-on-year. As a reminder, newly booked room nights excludes the impact of cancellations. Of course, these new bookings may be canceled in the future, especially as the very high percentage of new bookings in April were made with flexible cancellation policies. Reported room nights continue to be negative in April as cancellations outpaced new bookings. We expect our revenue in April to have a greater year-on-year decline than newly booked room nights, considering the impact of the cancellations in March for April stays. And also since many hotels, especially in Europe, were not open in April. New bookings revenue for full second quarter may vary from April's results, depending upon the level of travel demand and a combination of availability we experienced in May and June.  Now as Glenn noted, we're seeing some stability in our newly booked room night growth trends with a year-on-year decline rate being quite consistent for April after reducing rapidly through the first quarter. We believe that domestic travel will rebound sooner than international travel as we expect travelers to look to their home country or region first for a safe level option.  In April, we witnessed a meaningfully higher domestic mix in our business. Historically, domestic accommodation bookings represents about 45% of Booking.com's total business. And if we consider Western Europe as one market, the historic mix increases to about 55%. In April, Booking.com's domestic share increased to approximately 70%. And if you consider Western Europe as one market, the domestic mix increased over 75%. Towards the end of April, we saw some very early indications that domestic travel was starting to return in certain markets where shelter-in-place rules were relaxed, including Greater China, South Korea, Vietnam and Germany. Newly booked room nights in the U.S. declined less than our global average in April, and we saw an improvement in domestic travel during April, but we cannot tie this to relaxing of shelter-in-place rules, and these have only happened in a few states and in recent days.  I must emphasize again that it's too early to say we're witnessing anything like a broad rebound in travel, especially as we've seen some countries like Singapore, where travel demand was less impacted than other places initially, but is now seeing significant travel demand decreases associated with new outbreaks. If we look across all our business, the rates -- the decline rate for newly booked room nights in the last few days in April was only a few percent better than the decline rate in the first few days. We've also observed a meaningful change in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. In April, their customers mainly booked either very close to stay or several months out. The combined mix of both very short booking and bookings for over 2 months' time is twice the normal amount. This booking behavior change has also been accompanied by an increase in mobile bookings, particularly in our app, helping drive a higher mix of direct bookings, and we'll continue to focus on providing our customers with a great app experience.  As Glenn emphasized, we have a tough road ahead of us as we look to navigate through the unprecedented challenges that COVID-19 has presented to us. We're working hard to stabilize our business through actions, including our cost-savings initiatives and a significant bolstering of our liquidity position. We'll continue to optimize our business and our costs to align with expected market demand, and we'll work to position ourselves to capitalize upon the reemergence of travel demand, when that time occurs and whenever that demand occurs. We have the confidence that through these actions, we'll be well positioned to come out of this crisis and extend our global leadership role in the travel marketplace. With that, we will take your questions.\nGlenn Fogel: And David, can you hear me?\nDavid Goulden: I can hear you now, Glenn.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first response is from Mark Mahaney, RBC Capital.\nMark Mahaney: Maybe I'll try two questions. First, David, I think at the end, you talked about this increase in app bookings or a rise in direct bookings. Is that something you actually were able to drive that just happened randomly? And is there a way that coming out of this crisis that at the margin, you can tilt more of your bookings to you can accelerate this transition to direct bookings? And then secondly, thanks for the data points on the improvements in a couple of the markets. Any quantification on those? Is there any way to say that any of these markets, South Korea, Vietnam, whatever, are back at down 50% or something like that? Like what's the -- can you kind of draw the curve a little bit, if it -- or it may be too early?\nDavid Goulden: Yes, Mark, this is David. I'll take that. Let me go to the second question first. We have called out markets where there's been a double-digit improvement in the rate of decline from the start of April to the end of April. We really only kept our remarks through the month of April because early trends in May are too early to call. So I'm not going to tell you exactly how much they're down. I mentioned to that in total, even with this improvement we've seen in these markets, all-in room like decline rate is only a few points better at the end of the month than it was at the start. But the markets that we called out we see double-digit improvements during the course of the month of April. In terms of the shift towards app, first of all, I'll just caveat, as I said before, anything that we talk about in terms of April when we're running at kind of 10% to 15% of our normal volumes, you have to take and qualify through that lens and try not to draw too big a trend from it.  We did see during the course of the month that we saw more app customers, we saw more Genius customers, which is often tied to app use as well. And we're pleased the fact that in the areas we saw some demand increase or we saw the residual demand occur, more was going into the app. We'll continue to try and emphasize the app as we come first because we want to make sure that we drive more direct business and of course to the app, is one of the strongest ways to drive direct business. But I wouldn't say there was a particular strategy that drove us there. I'm pleased that, that's the way the things came out, and we're going to continue to understand how our customers are buying and try and continue that trend as demand starts to recover.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, David. Thank you, Glenn. Wishing you both the best.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Mark.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next response is from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. I just wanted to dig into the cost trends that you're seeing in April and also what you're planning for going forward. So could you help us think about that? Maybe starting with advertising, how that might trend relative to that new bookings metric? And then moving on to personnel and your other big chunks of expenses, what you're planning for there?\nGlenn Fogel: David, why don't you...\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Glenn. Let me take that. So marketing expenses are going to correlate quite closely to the rate of newly booked room nights. So you can assume a close correlation there. I've actually walked through a number of these in the prepared remarks to Q1, Q2, but just to summarize, sales and other -- obviously, a piece of that is -- a large piece of that is tied to our merchant platform, and that is variable with volume, but things like customer service costs and bad debt, as you saw, was a major factor in Q1. Those may continue to be a factor in Q2. Next biggest area, of course, is personnel. And as we mentioned, the hiring freeze and the other actions that we took did not have much of an impact in Q1.  In Q2, you'll get the full impact of those. Also to the extent that we are successful with our application for kind of aid that would generally help Q2 and some of the optimization actions that we've already taken, like KAYAK and OpenTable, will also help Q2. So as we move through the year and continue with optimization activities, that will also help with personnel expenses. We move through the year, although the government aid programs will be mainly focused upon Q2 and not the second half. As I mentioned, the pressure on decrease on G&A, particularly as we start to lap the DST expenses last year. And information technology is an interesting line. We saw obviously a fair amount of pressure on that in Q1. I pointed out that some of those costs related to our volumes. And even though our revenues were basically not pretty high in Q1, the volumes that we had to process through the business through refunds and cancellations, et cetera, were also high and that drove it costs up. That was one of the factors. We expect there to be less pressure on that line going through the rest of the year.\nKevin Kopelman: And then if I could just ask one quick follow-up. Can you talk about how successful you've been in getting refunds out to customers who have had to cancel and also helping them coordinate refunds when they're dealing with the hotels?\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Well, Glenn.\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So this is a difficult issue. We have customers who have purchased reservations far in the future perhaps, that were nonrefundable. And then there was a case of a pandemic and is a force majeure situation. We have a situation where the customer says, well, I can't travel because the government has said that you cannot travel there and we have hoteliers who are saying, wait, I can't refund everybody, I may have even spent the money here, and it's a difficult situation. So we always believe in trying to do what is best for the customers, and our contracts with our hoteliers is completely set up for this exact situation -- in force majeure situation, in which case, go over a long history of travel. That in a situation like this, the hotel should refund the customer. So what we'll do is we will provide monies to the customer and recover from the hotel. Now we've talked about that there is an issue.  Many of these hotels are closed right now. There's nobody actually there to have discussions with. We hope to get a significant portion over, but we don't know yet if you're not talking with the people. We always want to come up with a good relationship with hotels. So as they reopen, as things start again, we want to do this in the best way possible. I don't think we have any specific numbers to give. David has put in the reserves. And I think that's -- we hope for the best going forward.\nOperator: Your next response is from Naved Khan of SunTrust.\nNaved Khan: Just a couple of questions. So in the new bookings that are coming in, are you seeing any kind of pattern in terms of people -- more people opting for maybe alternative lodging versus the hotel or quite diverse? And then in terms of just the fixed cost, I think, David, you gave us a sense of where these were on your Q4 call. I think you said less than 50% of the OpEx. And after the initiatives that you're taking -- that you've taken or will take -- give us a sense of where these could land ultimately.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Naved, on the new bookings, I mentioned the fact that we're seeing a bit of, what I call dumbell in the current patent, which means that they're either pretty close to the current stay or they're a long way out. What happened in the first quarter is hotel and alternative performed about the same. So they basically were almost in lockstep from a growth point of view throughout the quarter. In April, we saw a shift to alternative associated with those longer-term bookings. So we saw alternative combinations doing better in the April bookings, particularly at the far end of the dumbbell, which is the two month plus out bookings, particularly in the domestic markets where we saw some decent return rates in the domestic markets in the month of April.  So that's what we saw relative to the mix. On the fixed costs, we are still, as Glenn said, I think you have more detail in his commentary. We are still building our optimized plans for many parts of the business. We really only put those in place yet. In one of our business segments, and we're working through the other business segments as we speak. And of course, the timing of that is also going to be tied to what we're doing around some of the government A programs. So I don't want to come with the number just yet. I'll give you a data point, for example, that the reductions that we took at KAYAK and OpenTable, reduced the personnel and off expenses there by about 20%. And those will be part of that fixed or semi-fixed cost base we talked about. That's one example. Beyond that, I really don't want to go into any of these will be come to finalize our plans yet, but as we do and when we do, we'll let you know what we expect them to do to our cost base.\nNaved Khan: Got it. Thank you and good luck.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next response is from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Alex Wang on for Brian. Just two questions. One, Glenn, you talked about sort of positioning the business to become stronger. Can you talk to us a little bit how you think about new strategies or approach in the U.S. market specifically coming out of the downturn? And then the second question, just given the state home dynamics and with strong social media use, do you see an opportunity to potentially use more social advertising to drive growth coming out of the downturn?\nGlenn Fogel: Thanks, Alex. It's very important for us as we come out as optimize to make sure that we're doing everything we can to become a better competitor in the U.S. We've talked in the past that we believe we under-index in the U.S., and that is something that is important to counter and be able to do. One of the things that we believe is providing a better overall value proposition to the customers. It's also as we talked in the past, and making our customers more -- or potential customers aware of this better value proposition. And that goes through the connected trip that we've talked about in the past. Now importantly, we think that we'll be able to buy something different and better to the consumer. But your point is a good one about social media and how do we get that message to those consumers. And with our CMO came from Google, who has been here about 10 months now, we absolutely believe that social area -- social media is a way to try and drive that message to the consumer. And we will be doing things in the future, albeit always looking what's the right ROI for that. It does us no good to waste advertising money.\nOperator: Your next response is from Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank.\nLloyd Walmsley: Two questions, if I can. First, can you just talk about how you see the P&L coming out of this? And specifically, do you think that performance marketing can structurally benefit perhaps from lower competition in advertising auctions? And then secondly, wondering if you're seeing any shift between kind of urban and more ski and beach type of locations in April bookings? And given somewhat of a shift to alternative, give us an update on how you feel about your whole home inventory position as people perhaps look to locations with less urban density.\nGlenn Fogel: All right. Well, let me start with the second one first about the nature of the -- where is the demand going in April and such. And I can't give any more specifics beyond what we've already described to a slight increase in people going for the alternative accommodations over home. I can say, no, there's not a lot of skiing in April. So that's what I can tell you. Remind me, your first question was.\nLloyd Walmsley: First question was do you -- how do you see the P&L coming out of this? And then might there be some longer-term structural benefits and lower competition in advertising auctions?\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So one of the things that I think is important to understand, while we do believe that, certainly, because of this pandemic, some of the smaller players in the industry are going to have trouble going forward. But the big players are still going to be around. They're going to be very competitive as they were in the past. And they are the ones who are the sophisticated players in the performance marketing area. So I don't think it's going to change a great deal there since the people who've been -- we competing against the past are going to be the same people going forward. So I don't see significant change in there. In terms of the P&L, when we get to that place down the road, that training sun where we have fully recovered, I hope to be doing what we did in the past, have the leading margins in the industry and still growing nicely. And that's about the best one can put forward in terms of a long-term prediction.\nOperator: Your next report is from Doug Almond of JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Dave Young on for Doug. So first one, can you talk about your business travel mix, what the mix was going into COVID-19 and do you have any data that suggests maybe what business is helping recovery in some of the markets where you are seeing some? And then in those markets where you are seeing some pickup in demand, were those countries recovering in a similar manner? Just looking to see if the timeline in those countries can help educate us on how other country recoveries might look like going forward?\nGlenn Fogel: So why don't I take the latter one -- I'll let take the former one. One of the things I think is somewhat -- I think it's something that can be deceiving in terms of trying to take what has happened in one country and then model outcomes everywhere else. And we've seen a little bit of cases where countries have begun to open up doing better. But then because they opened up the economy, there's a resurgence in infection, and then they put in the reinstatement of the restrictions and things go back. And I think it's hard to do that. And also, you have different countries that have different travel patterns. And also -- so I definitely would not -- I definitely would not take what is happening in one and then apply that across the entire world, saying, okay, that's how this is going to roll out. I think that'd be a chance to come up with a very bad prediction for the future. And David, in terms of the first question?\nDavid Goulden: Nothing really -- no major update on business travel as we don't have a formal percentage. We have a self-declared estimate that maybe as much as 1/5 of our business might be business travel, but it's not an always in number. It's not a number that we really track or spend a lot of time looking at. It's basically just a self-declared booking field. What I would say is -- and obviously, as Glenn said, we're just talking about very small deviation. We're trying to give as much color as we can for what we saw in April. What I will tell you, and it's pretty obvious that our domestic business was -- rates grew appreciably faster than the international rates. And to the extent that business travel was international. That's still very depressed. I'm not saying a large piece of -- obviously, a chunk of it is. So that's another way to look at it. We don't really have any specific data for the month of April, what happened to business travel versus non-business travel other than the fact that we know what happened to domestic versus international.\nOperator: Your next response from Stephen Ju of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: Earning and experimenting to merchandise better to the customer and connected travel have been themes you've been talking about for some time now. But with the demand environment being what it is, does that slow down the product development team in terms of the ability to innovate because I guess there's a comparative lack of data and consumer behavior. I guess your competitors are probably struggling with the same difficult circumstances as well. But strictly, as you think about what you wanted to achieve for booking in terms of product development and what the company looks like on the other side of the crisis?\nGlenn Fogel: You're right. One of the things that's been a great advantage for us is our experimentation ability because with more data, we able to come up with insights and be able to develop things much faster. And that's always been a great advantage for us. And if there's no demand, you're right, it's hard to put something in and say, is this working or not? How well does this work or not. So I agree with you that, but 1 can still make great insights with what, in comparison, a small amount of data, but still can give you the insights. Don't forget, we were a lot smaller 10 to 15 years ago but we were able to come up with a lot of new things that were very valuable and help make us a leader in innovation in this industry. And we believe that we'll still be able to do that. And the connected trip will still be going forward because we do believe, and we are seeing -- we're seeing data before COVID that was indicating we're going in the right way. And I do believe that this will continue going forward. As demand comes back, we'll be able to do more and more with that data.\nOperator: Your next response is from Eric Sheridan of UBS.\nEric Sheridan: The inventory longer term, Glenn. Any views about how supply might consolidate on the other side of COVID-19 just because of the benefits of needing scale versus some of the historical trends, which could be quite a positive for the OTAs as demand is needed and demand starts to pick up? Looking back at past periods, the OTAs tend to take share and tend to be a better partner for the hotel industry. So just curious about the relationship with supply and how you, yourself, see supply evolving over the long-term on the other side of COVID-19?\nGlenn Fogel: In the long run, the very long run, there'll be supply that will be commensurate with what it was before COVID and it will match up with what it is in the long run. There may be, there may be in the period right now going forward or going to this recovery, that there may be some decline in some areas of supply that just isn't as great a place to stay. And therefore, the demand doesn't go there and prices have adjusted that the better quality places are a little bit cheaper and people will go grab a take there. But here's the point. The buildings don't disappear. The hotel business doesn't -- building there -- if there's demand, it will get to maybe a new owner, it may be recapitalized and such. But it will be there. So I think in the long run, I am not concerned about a constraint on supply that impacts our ability to provide great value to the consumer at all or a chance that the supplier doesn't need us anymore. I don't see that happening at all.\nOperator: Your next response is from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Glenn, how would you characterize your answer to the previous question on the alternative accommodation side? I mean accommodations has a great mix of inventory from urban apartments to with traditional vacation rentals, and also people like hosts that are using this in homes. Have you seen any meaningful disruption on that side? Is that something that's going to change meaningfully long-term in your view? And then second question, I was also going to ask about your thoughts on investing behind brand. It feels like particularly in markets like U.S., you can invest on brand and then support it with some of the direct channels to capture a meaningful share of the initial recovery demand. What are your views on that?\nGlenn Fogel: Let me talk about the first one, we'll go back to the second one. So in terms of alternative accommodations, interesting question about will there be decline in the supply because there's no demand right now for many of them, and they just say, well, I'm not going to bother this, one. Two, is there an issue people are -- decide this isn't a great thing to do because they're concerned about having strangers in their homes and just don't want to have that, how long does that go for? You have also the trends beforehand about the regulatory environment, this issue of the pandemic increase regulatory restraints on the supply or not. The flip side of that is very interesting, of course, is where did the Airbnb and a lot of this business really come out of was the Great Recession in 2008, 2009, where a lot of people said I need to get extra income, so I'll rent out my spare bedroom or something of that nature.  Now of course, it's more to do a much more professional, I think. I think in the end, this is a good business for everybody. People like alternative accommodations. The people, the host, people own these properties, people are doing those cone industries, they like it. It's good money. And as demand comes back, they'll continue to do it. And there will be supply to meet that demand on the demand side. People, as you see right now, in just April alone, people see a need for it. I think that's good. I really don't see a lot of changes. One of the things -- and I'll just use your question to point to this is that people think the world is going to be so different and I don't think the world is going to be hugely different once we get past this. There have been pandemics in the past. I'll go back 100 years, go back, Hong Kong, flu, there have been pandemics. There have been terrible things. But in the end, people want to travel, people are willing to supply accommodations. And I don't see that there's going to be a great change in the long run. And your other question was?\nDeepak Mathivanan: Yes. It was just on using brand advertising and supported with direct channels to capture a lot of the incremental demand during the initial recovery curve. Do you think that's something that's possible? How are you thinking about it, at least in certain markets like U.S., where it feels like brand advertising can be more efficient initially?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, we're talking with the whole marketing team about that. One of the things you don't want to be doing. The reason we're not brand advertising right now is you don't want to be putting a message out when nobody is really listening or very few people are listening to it and you're spending the money for the number of people who you're spreading this message to who really are not interested in traveling right now. That's not an efficient use of the money. I talked a little earlier about we really want to be ROI-efficient in this. So I'm not sure -- certainly, when we think that enough people are ready to travel, then it'd be good to start pushing that message out to them. The critical thing is, when is that right point. We'll be measuring very carefully to see when that right time is.\nOperator: Your next response is from Justin Post of Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Two questions, and I apologize I have been asked. But first, thinking about your merchant platform today, much bigger than before. Does that help you when people are ready to come back and hotels are engaging with different offers or pricing or things like that? And then secondly, if you assume where people are going to travel in their own countries versus international, does that change anything for ADRs or your market share or your take rates?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, I'll do the first one. I'll let Dave talk to the second one. The merchant platform will be very important, and that's why we do believe it's unimportant is to continue to invest in our payments product and get that out because, as you point out, providing value, providing the right price, putting it together through that connected trip. That's one of the things we've talked about a lot. We still believe this is a great thing for consumers, really being able to put together different packages in a way. So paying one way and clearly, one of the things, too, is us having more control over the cash makes it much easier if a refund is needed to be doing it from one thing instead of a customer having to deal with refunds from their air, from their hotel, from their car, maybe other things that are -- attractions. They did all different people they talked to try and get refund from. By doing in one package connected trip with us through our merchant payment platform, we'll be able to give much better value, both in the time when they buy it and even if they have to deal with getting a refund. So that's more important. And David, I'll let you talk about ADRs and what do you think.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, sure. Thanks, Justin. So historically, both ADRs and length of stay been a little shorter for domestic travel because people's longer trips would be international and therefore, they've been going towards higher ADRs and long length of stay. Now to the extent those international trips get moved back into the domestic marketplace, that distinction may actually not be as great. Because if the domestic marketplace was generally more short-term-oriented and that mix shift and it becomes more the place where people want to go for the longer major vacations, et cetera, that may not be as big a factor as it was before. And there's really no difference to take rate.\nOperator: Your next response is from Daniel Powell of Goldman Sachs.\nDaniel Powell: Great. Two, if I may. First is kind of to build on the question around timing of advertising and when you decide to sort of step back on the gas. I guess sort of what are you looking for sort of indicate when would be a good time to step in? And what would your expectation be around ROIs, if there's been somewhat of a vacuum created from hotels and other partners perhaps not being as able or willing to spend when things start to look a little bit better? And then the second question, you mentioned maintaining good relationships with your suppliers. Wondering if you could sort of give us a sense of during the global financial crisis, what did your relationships, what did your access to inventory look like coming out of that environment versus what you might expect in this one?\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. So regarding the brand advertising, I'm sure you'll forgive me for saying, I'm not -- I really don't want to give away exactly when we're going to put on the gas or what the signals are so our competitors can then get a jump on that. I'm sure you all understand that. Look, it is important, though, for us to feel that we are going to be effective in using that brand advertising and going through it. And as the question earlier about there's a lot of the things that we can do desktop now and be able to put out what is half video, half of -- half brand enhanced performance through video channels that you can start seeing some better response and a better sense of where your ROIs are not be able a little bit more selective in how you use that. I think we're going to definitely be pushing that way.  In regards to the supply relationships and the Great Recession as a model going forward, we were very pleased to see that -- and this is why we feel comfortable and confident to talk about how a deep recession can be helpful to distributors because in the past, the suppliers leaned in heavily into distributors who have demand for the obvious reason, that if you're a hotel and you're running 40% or 30% rate, you need to get that demand, and we're here to provide it to them. So that helps build that better relationship and I do think that's what you're going to see going forward. And I do agree. I think that some of them may not be doing as much brand advertising as perhaps they were in the past. That'd be due to cash constraints and other things where they need to make sure they're maintaining a certain amount of cash flow.\nDaniel Powell: Great. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next response is from Lee Horowitz of Evercore ISI.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Given the moves you guys have made with your balance sheet and shorten things up and obviously depressed private and public valuations, I'm wondering how you're thinking about your potential ability to be an acquirer of assets across the travel space during this crisis, given your strong balance sheet?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, we like -- we always like having a strong balance sheet for many reasons, that being one of them. And of course, valuations, as we know, have changed drastically, but they've changed drastically for a reason. And so a risk factor is significantly increased than it was a short time ago. So our way we approach acquiring assets or any type of acquisition, is always the same, which is we measure in terms of what will add to our business for the franchise to help consumers and partners, what is that's going to be great. What do we think about management? Do we think they're good? Do we think they can help us or not? And if not, can we operate this or will this add without that management team? This is something that we always we built our company through M&A, as you know, and we're going to continue to look out for that. But we recognize that this is a frothy time, and we have to be careful and picky in terms of what we do because the risk factors are much higher now. And Dave, do you want to talk anything more about the balance sheet or no?\nDavid Goulden: No.\nOperator: Okay. Our final question is from James Hardiman of Wedbush Securities.\nJames Hardiman: So really appreciate all the data points on March and April, obviously, somewhat limited. But I wanted to take a step back. I was curious if you guys have done some consumer work, seems like you're in a unique position to sort of understand what types of travel consumers are most likely to reengage in the soonest? Obviously, there's air travel, hotels, restaurants, vacation homes, apartments, even car rental, all of which you guys have your -- a piece of, how are you thinking about which of those are most likely to resume normality, the quickest?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, what we've seen is the hotel area, and Dave talked a little bit about what we've seen in that, a lot of air is still extremely limited, whether by government restrictions, like people to go to certain countries or the amount of flights and times available, and people just on fearful about getting on a clean right now. And you may have seen, for example, the RyanAir data that just came out in Europe, RyanAir is a good bellwether for air travel in Europe in April. It was essentially almost nothing, but really almost nothing. And that's, unfortunately, what we've seen in other parts of the world, extremely low amounts of air travel. But it's all will go somewhat together as people feel more comfortable about how their entire situation. It's the vaccine we talked about, it's a treatment perhaps, it's also in their economic situation, all those things. So I think what we'll see as things start coming back, yes, some things will be the other one. But I think overall, it will all come back pretty very similar.\nJames Hardiman: Got it. And then last question for me, if I may. It sounds like you're not quite ready to give any sort of a monthly cash burn number, just given some of the expense optimization that's still going on. But maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes. You've got about $1 billion of deferred merchant bookings. How quickly is that coming down? Are there timing differences between when you provide refunds to customers versus when you're getting those refunds from the hotels? And then can you help us with an interest number given the transactions that's taking place as in late?\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Well, thank you, James. So this is Dave, I'll wrap up with this one. So we haven't given a cash flow projection for the year. We did give you an indication as to kind of what our cash position would look like at the end of 2021 before we did our bond offering. And now because we have significantly $4.1 billion more than that. So we're not going to get into to a monthly burn. We walk you through the changes to our balance sheet for working capital movements in Q1. Those balances will continue to reduce until we start to get travel demand occurring once again. And I think the best way to handle it is once we've really gone through our optimization plans, and we decided where we're going to reset our cost base too, at that point in time, we'll give you more color as to where we are. I do not have an interest rate number for you off the top of my head, but we can follow-up with everybody forward with that one.\nJames Hardiman: Good enough. Appreciate it.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Glenn Fogel.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. I understand there was a technical difficulty. And some of the last part of my speech -- my prepared remarks was cut off. I think what actually works out well because the last 2 paragraphs, which were actually in a nice way to close this off. So let me disclose that all for everyone. Look, we know the progress against the pandemic is going to be disruptive at times as relaxation of social distancing in some geographies may lead to a resurgence of infections and/or reinstatement of government restrictions. Our aim is to optimize the business to participate in the ultimate return of demand, manage our expenses in light of our best estimate of the shape of that return, invest in our business to build on our leadership position in the industry and serve our customers, employees and partners and build shareholder value going forward.  We have a tough road ahead of us. And we have been through many difficult issues in the past, the last few weeks, and we're going to have some in the future, the weeks, the months and quarters to come. The pace scale and impact of COVID-19 is unprecedented. But we know one day, we will be on the other side, and we are doing everything we can to ensure we are well positioned to navigate through these challenging times. We have the confidence that with a highly variable cost structure, strong cash and liquidity, great global brand awareness and some of the best people anywhere, we are well positioned to come out of this crisis and extend our leadership role in the global travel ecosystem. Now I'm going to close by giving a heartfelt thank you to all the employees, our customers, our partners and the governments as we work through these difficult days together.  And to our employees, I have never been more proud of you and your enormous efforts to support our customers, partners everywhere. We know there will be more tough days ahead. Not just for us, but for so many people industries all over the world. But I am confident we will get through it. And lastly, I want to say thank you to all the frontline workers out there. The doctors and nurses, the scientists trying to come up with a cure or vaccine, the delivery people, the people making sure they'll be food in the stores, basically, to everybody in a job that is designated as critical. To all of you working night and day to help our will get through this. Thank you from all of us at Booking Holdings. Good night.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Have a good day.",

            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Hello are we still on the line? Thank you. Hello, operator, can you hear me? Okay. Am I live on the line? Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. Operator, am I on the line? Can you confirm that, please? I can... Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the first quarter, discuss our stabilization initiative to bolster our liquidity and provide some color on trends we saw in April. All growth rates related to the prior year comparable period, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.  Now on to our results for the quarter. At the time of our last earnings call on February 26, the outbreak of COVID-19 was largely contained to Asia, and we're yet to see a meaningful impact in our business across Europe or North America. As we moved into March, the COVID outbreak continues to spread throughout Europe and North America, leading to the eventual declaration of a global pandemic and the implementation of numerous travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. Not surprisingly, we saw a resulting sharp duration of our top line trends in March with significant levels of cancellations and a substantial reduction in the level of new bookings. Although we only felt the full brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic around mid- to late March, our Q1 results were still significantly negatively impacted.  Our Q1 reported room nights declined 43% for the fourth quarter. However, that decline exceeded 100% in March, we received more cancellation of the new bookings in the month. Our cancellation rate peaked in mid-March, has been steadily improving then as we work through the way the cancellation of bookings made prior to the imposition of restrictions on travel. Gross bookings declined 51% in Q1, which is a greater decline than reported room nights due to average daily rates for accommodations decreasing about 15% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Consolidated non-GAAP revenue for the first quarter was $2.3 billion and decreased 21% year-on-year. Revenue in the quarter was less negatively impacted the room nights and gross bookings due to the fact that many cancellations were received in Q1 were checks -- that were expected to occur later -- were expect to occur in later quarters. Adjusted Q1 for EBITDA was $290 million, which was down 60% year-on-year. We benefit from having a highly variable cost structure that naturally declines in periods of low travel demand. As Glenn noted, we are taking further actions in reducing other areas of spend as we stabilize and then move to optimize and line our cost structure with the new demand environment. With that being said, there were some areas of expense pressure in the quarter related to COVID-19 pandemic that I'll walk you through.  Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense, decreased 29% year-on-year, as we saw a significant reduction in demand in the paid channels. In addition, we took actions to substantially reduce our brand marketing spend in response to the diminished travel demand environment. We expect our marketing expense will remain significantly below 2019 levels for the remainder of the year. Sales and other expenses increased 75% year-on-year due primarily to $183 million increase in provisions for expected bad debt and other credit losses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Excluding the impact of the increased provision we recorded in the quarter, sales and other decreased 10% year-on-year as this expense line is substantially variable in nature. For example, we recorded lower expenses associated with payments in Q1. This reduction was partially offset by higher outsourced customer service costs as we work through the heavy volume of cancellations we received in the quarter. Personnel expense decreased 3% year-over-year, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation which was impacted by reduced financial performance as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding SBC expenses, personnel increased 12% year-over-year and although we have implemented a hiring freeze, personnel expense this quarter was impacted by annualized hires that were made last year. We expect the pressure on personnel expense will diminish as we move through the year.  G&A expenses increased 6% year-over-year largely driven by higher indirect taxes, including digital service taxes. Excluding these indirect taxes, G&A expense decreased 7% year-over-year as we reduced discretionary expenses such as G&A expense. We will see less year-over-year pressure on G&A from digital service taxes once we lap the enactments of the French DST, which occurred in Q3 of last year.  Finally, information technology expenses increased 20% year-on-year, driven by higher software fees and outsourced data center and cloud costs. On a GAAP basis, we incurred an operating loss of $308 million as our GAAP operating expenses in the quarter included a charge of $489 million related to an impairment of goodwill for OpenTable and KAYAK. This impairment charge is driven by a reduced financial projections as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We excluded the impairment of goodwill for our non-GAAP results. Our Q1 GAAP net loss was $699 million. Our Q1 GAAP net loss includes $307 million of pretax losses on our equity investments in Trip.com and Meituan and the $100 million impairment charge related to our strategic investments. This was partially offset by $33 million of FX remeasurement gains on our euro bonds. We exclude these unrealized losses, impairment charge and remeasurement gains from our non-GAAP results.  Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance was $9.2 billion, which decreased from our December ending balance by $11.8 billion due to several factors, including the following primary drivers. First, we had $380 million of operating cash outflow in the quarter, which was driven by an $820 million use of cash due to change in working capital as well as the lower earnings we generated in the quarter. Working capital in Q1 was negatively impacted by a prepayment of tax rate in the Netherlands of 719 -- $717 million that was subsequently refunded in April. The large reductions in our deferred merchant bookings, accounts payable and accrued expenses balances were mostly offset by the significant reduction in our accounts receivable balance in Q1. The deferred merchant booking reduction was driven by both lower bookings and customer refunds. We expect these balances will all continue to decline in the low level of bookings we are currently seeing in the business.  Second, we repurchased $1.3 billion of our stock in Q1, almost all of which was purchased under a stock buyback plan we filed last November. We halted buybacks as soon as we recognize the growing impact of the pandemic. Third, we had CapEx of $80 million in the quarter. And finally, the value of our investments decline in parts by the $307 million unrealized loss on equity securities and the $100 million impairment related to a strategic investment that I mentioned earlier. In addition, we had $106 million decline in investment value that did not impact the P&L but was reflected in the balance sheet. The majority of the remaining $288 million difference between cash and investments at year-end on March 31, is primarily due to the timing of the settlement of sales was from corporate bonds that were classified in prepaid expenses and other assets at the end of March. These sales have settled in April and moved into cash and investments.  In our efforts to stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis, we've taken several steps to show up and bolster our liquidity position. We halted repurchase of our stock, and we will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. We worked to receive a refund in April of the prepayment of taxes in the Netherlands that was made early in Q1. We amended our revolving credit facility to substitute a minimum liquidity covenants for the previous leverage covenants due in June 21 to ensure we continue to have access to the source of liquidity. And finally, and most notably, we completed a bond and convertible note offering on April 8 that raised $4.1 billion of capital.  If you adjust our March 31 ending cash investment balance of $9.2 billion for our bond and convertible note offering and the settlement of the corporate bond sales and the refund of the Dutch tax prepayments, all of which occurred in April, on March 31, cash and investment balance will increase to about $14.3 billion. Approximately $12 billion of this is highly liquid after considering the actions we've taken, including recently completing the sale of our trip.com ADSs, moving on cash and investments into corporate -- moving on cash and investments in corporate bonds into AAA treasury and government money market funds. After the bond and convertible offering, we have about $13 billion of debt, $4 billion of which matures before the end of 2022.  Due to the COVID-19 crisis, I will not provide quarterly guidance like we normally do. However, I will provide some color from our preliminary April results, which will give you a clear picture of our recent top line trends considering that April was the first month fully impacted by the pandemic. As Glenn mentioned, our newly booked room nights in April were down over 85% year-on-year. As a reminder, newly booked room nights excludes the impact of cancellations. Of course, these new bookings may be canceled in the future, especially as the very high percentage of new bookings in April were made with flexible cancellation policies. Reported room nights continue to be negative in April as cancellations outpaced new bookings. We expect our revenue in April to have a greater year-on-year decline than newly booked room nights, considering the impact of the cancellations in March for April stays. And also since many hotels, especially in Europe, were not open in April. New bookings revenue for full second quarter may vary from April's results, depending upon the level of travel demand and a combination of availability we experienced in May and June.  Now as Glenn noted, we're seeing some stability in our newly booked room night growth trends with a year-on-year decline rate being quite consistent for April after reducing rapidly through the first quarter. We believe that domestic travel will rebound sooner than international travel as we expect travelers to look to their home country or region first for a safe level option.  In April, we witnessed a meaningfully higher domestic mix in our business. Historically, domestic accommodation bookings represents about 45% of Booking.com's total business. And if we consider Western Europe as one market, the historic mix increases to about 55%. In April, Booking.com's domestic share increased to approximately 70%. And if you consider Western Europe as one market, the domestic mix increased over 75%. Towards the end of April, we saw some very early indications that domestic travel was starting to return in certain markets where shelter-in-place rules were relaxed, including Greater China, South Korea, Vietnam and Germany. Newly booked room nights in the U.S. declined less than our global average in April, and we saw an improvement in domestic travel during April, but we cannot tie this to relaxing of shelter-in-place rules, and these have only happened in a few states and in recent days.  I must emphasize again that it's too early to say we're witnessing anything like a broad rebound in travel, especially as we've seen some countries like Singapore, where travel demand was less impacted than other places initially, but is now seeing significant travel demand decreases associated with new outbreaks. If we look across all our business, the rates -- the decline rate for newly booked room nights in the last few days in April was only a few percent better than the decline rate in the first few days. We've also observed a meaningful change in Booking.com's customer booking behavior. In April, their customers mainly booked either very close to stay or several months out. The combined mix of both very short booking and bookings for over 2 months' time is twice the normal amount. This booking behavior change has also been accompanied by an increase in mobile bookings, particularly in our app, helping drive a higher mix of direct bookings, and we'll continue to focus on providing our customers with a great app experience.  As Glenn emphasized, we have a tough road ahead of us as we look to navigate through the unprecedented challenges that COVID-19 has presented to us. We're working hard to stabilize our business through actions, including our cost-savings initiatives and a significant bolstering of our liquidity position. We'll continue to optimize our business and our costs to align with expected market demand, and we'll work to position ourselves to capitalize upon the reemergence of travel demand, when that time occurs and whenever that demand occurs. We have the confidence that through these actions, we'll be well positioned to come out of this crisis and extend our global leadership role in the travel marketplace. With that, we will take your questions. I can hear you now, Glenn. Yes, Mark, this is David. I'll take that. Let me go to the second question first. We have called out markets where there's been a double-digit improvement in the rate of decline from the start of April to the end of April. We really only kept our remarks through the month of April because early trends in May are too early to call. So I'm not going to tell you exactly how much they're down. I mentioned to that in total, even with this improvement we've seen in these markets, all-in room like decline rate is only a few points better at the end of the month than it was at the start. But the markets that we called out we see double-digit improvements during the course of the month of April. In terms of the shift towards app, first of all, I'll just caveat, as I said before, anything that we talk about in terms of April when we're running at kind of 10% to 15% of our normal volumes, you have to take and qualify through that lens and try not to draw too big a trend from it.  We did see during the course of the month that we saw more app customers, we saw more Genius customers, which is often tied to app use as well. And we're pleased the fact that in the areas we saw some demand increase or we saw the residual demand occur, more was going into the app. We'll continue to try and emphasize the app as we come first because we want to make sure that we drive more direct business and of course to the app, is one of the strongest ways to drive direct business. But I wouldn't say there was a particular strategy that drove us there. I'm pleased that, that's the way the things came out, and we're going to continue to understand how our customers are buying and try and continue that trend as demand starts to recover. Thank you, Mark. Yes. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you, Glenn. Let me take that. So marketing expenses are going to correlate quite closely to the rate of newly booked room nights. So you can assume a close correlation there. I've actually walked through a number of these in the prepared remarks to Q1, Q2, but just to summarize, sales and other -- obviously, a piece of that is -- a large piece of that is tied to our merchant platform, and that is variable with volume, but things like customer service costs and bad debt, as you saw, was a major factor in Q1. Those may continue to be a factor in Q2. Next biggest area, of course, is personnel. And as we mentioned, the hiring freeze and the other actions that we took did not have much of an impact in Q1.  In Q2, you'll get the full impact of those. Also to the extent that we are successful with our application for kind of aid that would generally help Q2 and some of the optimization actions that we've already taken, like KAYAK and OpenTable, will also help Q2. So as we move through the year and continue with optimization activities, that will also help with personnel expenses. We move through the year, although the government aid programs will be mainly focused upon Q2 and not the second half. As I mentioned, the pressure on decrease on G&A, particularly as we start to lap the DST expenses last year. And information technology is an interesting line. We saw obviously a fair amount of pressure on that in Q1. I pointed out that some of those costs related to our volumes. And even though our revenues were basically not pretty high in Q1, the volumes that we had to process through the business through refunds and cancellations, et cetera, were also high and that drove it costs up. That was one of the factors. We expect there to be less pressure on that line going through the rest of the year. Yes. Well, Glenn. Yes. Naved, on the new bookings, I mentioned the fact that we're seeing a bit of, what I call dumbell in the current patent, which means that they're either pretty close to the current stay or they're a long way out. What happened in the first quarter is hotel and alternative performed about the same. So they basically were almost in lockstep from a growth point of view throughout the quarter. In April, we saw a shift to alternative associated with those longer-term bookings. So we saw alternative combinations doing better in the April bookings, particularly at the far end of the dumbbell, which is the two month plus out bookings, particularly in the domestic markets where we saw some decent return rates in the domestic markets in the month of April.  So that's what we saw relative to the mix. On the fixed costs, we are still, as Glenn said, I think you have more detail in his commentary. We are still building our optimized plans for many parts of the business. We really only put those in place yet. In one of our business segments, and we're working through the other business segments as we speak. And of course, the timing of that is also going to be tied to what we're doing around some of the government A programs. So I don't want to come with the number just yet. I'll give you a data point, for example, that the reductions that we took at KAYAK and OpenTable, reduced the personnel and off expenses there by about 20%. And those will be part of that fixed or semi-fixed cost base we talked about. That's one example. Beyond that, I really don't want to go into any of these will be come to finalize our plans yet, but as we do and when we do, we'll let you know what we expect them to do to our cost base. Nothing really -- no major update on business travel as we don't have a formal percentage. We have a self-declared estimate that maybe as much as 1/5 of our business might be business travel, but it's not an always in number. It's not a number that we really track or spend a lot of time looking at. It's basically just a self-declared booking field. What I would say is -- and obviously, as Glenn said, we're just talking about very small deviation. We're trying to give as much color as we can for what we saw in April. What I will tell you, and it's pretty obvious that our domestic business was -- rates grew appreciably faster than the international rates. And to the extent that business travel was international. That's still very depressed. I'm not saying a large piece of -- obviously, a chunk of it is. So that's another way to look at it. We don't really have any specific data for the month of April, what happened to business travel versus non-business travel other than the fact that we know what happened to domestic versus international. Yes, sure. Thanks, Justin. So historically, both ADRs and length of stay been a little shorter for domestic travel because people's longer trips would be international and therefore, they've been going towards higher ADRs and long length of stay. Now to the extent those international trips get moved back into the domestic marketplace, that distinction may actually not be as great. Because if the domestic marketplace was generally more short-term-oriented and that mix shift and it becomes more the place where people want to go for the longer major vacations, et cetera, that may not be as big a factor as it was before. And there's really no difference to take rate. No. Yes. Well, thank you, James. So this is Dave, I'll wrap up with this one. So we haven't given a cash flow projection for the year. We did give you an indication as to kind of what our cash position would look like at the end of 2021 before we did our bond offering. And now because we have significantly $4.1 billion more than that. So we're not going to get into to a monthly burn. We walk you through the changes to our balance sheet for working capital movements in Q1. Those balances will continue to reduce until we start to get travel demand occurring once again. And I think the best way to handle it is once we've really gone through our optimization plans, and we decided where we're going to reset our cost base too, at that point in time, we'll give you more color as to where we are. I do not have an interest rate number for you off the top of my head, but we can follow-up with everybody forward with that one."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. We are living in difficult times. Since our last call in February, the spread of COVID-19 has grown exponentially, bringing uncertainty, turmoil [Technical Difficulty] ever seen. Billions of people have been under stay-at-home orders, and there have been and continue to be closures of orders, government enforce travel restrictions and strict guidelines regarding social distancing. These actions have profoundly affected our industry in every corner of this [indiscernible]. While our Q1 reported room nights declined 43% year-over-year, we did not see the virus' full negative force on our business until mid- to late March. So the 43% decline does not truly reflect the state of our business nor the travel industry today. In March, our reported room nights declined over 100%, meaning we received more cancellations during that month in new bookings.  Looking at things a different way. Our newly booked room nights, which exclude the impact of cancellations, were down over 60% year-over-year in March and down over 85% in April. This gives you a clear indication of how much our business is currently impacted by this crisis. That being said, while the virus impact on travel is unprecedented, I am confident that this crisis will eventually end and people will travel again. Travel is fundamental to who we are. And while it may take some time to return to pre-COVID-19 levels, we will get there eventually. And then we'd expect travel to continue to grow thereafter.  So what are we doing now as we wait for effective treatments for a successful vaccine? During the first quarter, when it became clear that the virus impact was going to be more significant than anyone initially anticipated, we quickly developed a series of plans to help us navigate through these challenging times. One, stabilize the business from the immediate shock of the crisis; two, optimize the business for the expected decrease in travel demand over the next few years; and three, position the business to capture travel demand when it returns. So we can emerge from this crisis on strong footing and extend our leadership position.  As we entered the stabilization phase at the beginning of the crisis, our employees' health and safety was a top priority. But what we have -- although we have a few offices currently open in Asia, the vast majority of our employees are now working from home, including our customer service teams, which is no small accomplishment considering the technology requirements and the huge increase in change requests and cancellations that we experienced. I am very proud of our teams and pleased to say that we are functioning well in this new distributed environment.  Another immediate priority was helping our customers and our supply partners. For a number of weeks, we were fielding a significantly higher number of daily inbound calls than we typically received. For our customers, this entailed supporting them as they sought refunds from bookings that were no longer possible due to government regulations or made requests to modify their travel plans. For our partners, many of whom do not have the ability to process such a large volume of customer service calls, we supported them by handling the unprecedented level of cancellations and date modifications request.  Looking ahead, we'll be working with our trial partners to create plans to stimulate trial orders to book again once this crisis is behind us. We know how critical it will be to bring demand to our supply partners in a cost-effective way. Also as part of our stabilization plan, we took immediate steps to conserve cash and increase liquidity such as halting stock buybacks, dramatically reducing marketing spend worldwide, cutting nonessential costs, implementing a general hire increase and reducing executive compensation, with our brand CEOs and I forgoing salaries during this crisis, and the other senior managers throughout the company voluntarily reducing their base salaries and our Board of Directors forgoing their cash fees. In addition to reducing costs, we bolstered our liquidity by raising over $4 billion in debt. These measures have enabled us to have sufficient liquidity to weather a long period of significantly reduced travel demand and have the necessary resources to invest in securing demand when people are ready to travel again.  We've now begun to refine and execute our optimized plan in which we will adapt to the new reality that assumes it will be -- likely be years, not quarters, before we witness a full recovery of global travel demand. We believe that either a vaccine or effective treatment is needed before people will feel fully comfortable traveling the way they did before the pandemic started. And even after our vaccine or treatment is declared safe and effective, we believe it may be some time before there is efficient quantity and distribution to them to give people and governments confidence for people to travel freely. Furthermore, as in pre-COVID-19 days, that will be dependent on the overall economy, consumers' financial health having gone through a very deep recession and consumers' confidence in their own economic futures. For these reasons, we expect travel to fully recover a leader than many other industries. However, when travel demand does start to recover, we believe there'll be attractive growth opportunities.  We are in the process of assessing the cost structure of our entire company in helping plans to align it with expected market demand. As part of these efforts, we're also evaluating our strategic initiatives and the timing of significant expenditures. We intend to continue to invest in our key projects, such as payments, in the connected trip that we believe will position us well for the future. But we are also reexamining all areas of the company to see where can we reduce or delay cost where possible. Fortunately, our financial strength allows us to make strategic decisions oriented towards the long-term interest of the business. We recently completed a strategic evaluation on OpenTable and KAYAK, announcing last week a series of actions to reduce operating costs. Unfortunately, this included the decision to lay off and furlough some employees. As a principle during this crisis, we have not reached first for employee reductions to lower costs. But after making adjustments in other operating expense areas, we made the tough decision to ensure the size and scope of our business is proportionate to the new realities of the travel market. We are now working with the other brands to examine their cost structures, and we will be thoughtful and deliberate in our evaluations.  In an attempt to minimize the impact on our employees during these difficult times, we have been evaluating and employing various governmental financial support programs. Booking.com recently announced that it would participate in the employee aid program offered by the United Kingdom. And we were able to place employees on furlough there, which has enabled employees to receive a significant portion of their full-time salary. We have also applied to the Dutch government 15E under the recently enacted program to support employment in the Netherlands. This program provides funds to Dutch companies impacted by this crisis and covers a portion of employee salaries for a 3-month period with the requirement that companies which receive this aid maintain employment during the time the aid is provided. These programs, along with all the other steps we have taken, will help us support employees and maintain jobs as we continue to fully evaluate the operating environment. We will continue to look at other available options that might help us mitigate near-term headcount reductions during this period of significantly reduced revenue.  The actions we are taking are stabilization and optimization phases are being done so that we can capitalize quickly and efficiently on travel demand when it becomes safe for people to travel again. We want to emerge from this crisis and a strong organization that is equipped to deliver for our customers and our partners will capitalize and in a position to increase our market share when the world is ready to travel again.  On a smaller but somewhat positive note, we are seeing some stability in our newly booked room night growth trends. We hope that this is the beginning of the road back to recovery, but it is simply too early to say with certainty. Some governments have seen progress in limiting or reducing the pandemic. They have slowly begun to reopen their economies, and we have seen new bookings, primarily for domestic travel, although still at very low levels. Some or many of these reservations may ultimately be canceled, but we believe it does show that travel for essential business and personal reasons will slowly return as society makes progress against the pandemic. As travel returns, we expect to see improvement in our revenue.  We are also prepared for disruption in that progress as relaxation of social distancing in some geographies may lead to a resurgence of infections and reinstatement of government restrictions. Our aim is to optimize the business to participate in the ultimate return of demand [Technical Difficulty]. And David, can you hear me? Thank you. David, why don't you... Yes. So this is a difficult issue. We have customers who have purchased reservations far in the future perhaps, that were nonrefundable. And then there was a case of a pandemic and is a force majeure situation. We have a situation where the customer says, well, I can't travel because the government has said that you cannot travel there and we have hoteliers who are saying, wait, I can't refund everybody, I may have even spent the money here, and it's a difficult situation. So we always believe in trying to do what is best for the customers, and our contracts with our hoteliers is completely set up for this exact situation -- in force majeure situation, in which case, go over a long history of travel. That in a situation like this, the hotel should refund the customer. So what we'll do is we will provide monies to the customer and recover from the hotel. Now we've talked about that there is an issue.  Many of these hotels are closed right now. There's nobody actually there to have discussions with. We hope to get a significant portion over, but we don't know yet if you're not talking with the people. We always want to come up with a good relationship with hotels. So as they reopen, as things start again, we want to do this in the best way possible. I don't think we have any specific numbers to give. David has put in the reserves. And I think that's -- we hope for the best going forward. Thank you. Thanks, Alex. It's very important for us as we come out as optimize to make sure that we're doing everything we can to become a better competitor in the U.S. We've talked in the past that we believe we under-index in the U.S., and that is something that is important to counter and be able to do. One of the things that we believe is providing a better overall value proposition to the customers. It's also as we talked in the past, and making our customers more -- or potential customers aware of this better value proposition. And that goes through the connected trip that we've talked about in the past. Now importantly, we think that we'll be able to buy something different and better to the consumer. But your point is a good one about social media and how do we get that message to those consumers. And with our CMO came from Google, who has been here about 10 months now, we absolutely believe that social area -- social media is a way to try and drive that message to the consumer. And we will be doing things in the future, albeit always looking what's the right ROI for that. It does us no good to waste advertising money. All right. Well, let me start with the second one first about the nature of the -- where is the demand going in April and such. And I can't give any more specifics beyond what we've already described to a slight increase in people going for the alternative accommodations over home. I can say, no, there's not a lot of skiing in April. So that's what I can tell you. Remind me, your first question was. Yes. So one of the things that I think is important to understand, while we do believe that, certainly, because of this pandemic, some of the smaller players in the industry are going to have trouble going forward. But the big players are still going to be around. They're going to be very competitive as they were in the past. And they are the ones who are the sophisticated players in the performance marketing area. So I don't think it's going to change a great deal there since the people who've been -- we competing against the past are going to be the same people going forward. So I don't see significant change in there. In terms of the P&L, when we get to that place down the road, that training sun where we have fully recovered, I hope to be doing what we did in the past, have the leading margins in the industry and still growing nicely. And that's about the best one can put forward in terms of a long-term prediction. So why don't I take the latter one -- I'll let take the former one. One of the things I think is somewhat -- I think it's something that can be deceiving in terms of trying to take what has happened in one country and then model outcomes everywhere else. And we've seen a little bit of cases where countries have begun to open up doing better. But then because they opened up the economy, there's a resurgence in infection, and then they put in the reinstatement of the restrictions and things go back. And I think it's hard to do that. And also, you have different countries that have different travel patterns. And also -- so I definitely would not -- I definitely would not take what is happening in one and then apply that across the entire world, saying, okay, that's how this is going to roll out. I think that'd be a chance to come up with a very bad prediction for the future. And David, in terms of the first question? You're right. One of the things that's been a great advantage for us is our experimentation ability because with more data, we able to come up with insights and be able to develop things much faster. And that's always been a great advantage for us. And if there's no demand, you're right, it's hard to put something in and say, is this working or not? How well does this work or not. So I agree with you that, but 1 can still make great insights with what, in comparison, a small amount of data, but still can give you the insights. Don't forget, we were a lot smaller 10 to 15 years ago but we were able to come up with a lot of new things that were very valuable and help make us a leader in innovation in this industry. And we believe that we'll still be able to do that. And the connected trip will still be going forward because we do believe, and we are seeing -- we're seeing data before COVID that was indicating we're going in the right way. And I do believe that this will continue going forward. As demand comes back, we'll be able to do more and more with that data. In the long run, the very long run, there'll be supply that will be commensurate with what it was before COVID and it will match up with what it is in the long run. There may be, there may be in the period right now going forward or going to this recovery, that there may be some decline in some areas of supply that just isn't as great a place to stay. And therefore, the demand doesn't go there and prices have adjusted that the better quality places are a little bit cheaper and people will go grab a take there. But here's the point. The buildings don't disappear. The hotel business doesn't -- building there -- if there's demand, it will get to maybe a new owner, it may be recapitalized and such. But it will be there. So I think in the long run, I am not concerned about a constraint on supply that impacts our ability to provide great value to the consumer at all or a chance that the supplier doesn't need us anymore. I don't see that happening at all. Let me talk about the first one, we'll go back to the second one. So in terms of alternative accommodations, interesting question about will there be decline in the supply because there's no demand right now for many of them, and they just say, well, I'm not going to bother this, one. Two, is there an issue people are -- decide this isn't a great thing to do because they're concerned about having strangers in their homes and just don't want to have that, how long does that go for? You have also the trends beforehand about the regulatory environment, this issue of the pandemic increase regulatory restraints on the supply or not. The flip side of that is very interesting, of course, is where did the Airbnb and a lot of this business really come out of was the Great Recession in 2008, 2009, where a lot of people said I need to get extra income, so I'll rent out my spare bedroom or something of that nature.  Now of course, it's more to do a much more professional, I think. I think in the end, this is a good business for everybody. People like alternative accommodations. The people, the host, people own these properties, people are doing those cone industries, they like it. It's good money. And as demand comes back, they'll continue to do it. And there will be supply to meet that demand on the demand side. People, as you see right now, in just April alone, people see a need for it. I think that's good. I really don't see a lot of changes. One of the things -- and I'll just use your question to point to this is that people think the world is going to be so different and I don't think the world is going to be hugely different once we get past this. There have been pandemics in the past. I'll go back 100 years, go back, Hong Kong, flu, there have been pandemics. There have been terrible things. But in the end, people want to travel, people are willing to supply accommodations. And I don't see that there's going to be a great change in the long run. And your other question was? Well, we're talking with the whole marketing team about that. One of the things you don't want to be doing. The reason we're not brand advertising right now is you don't want to be putting a message out when nobody is really listening or very few people are listening to it and you're spending the money for the number of people who you're spreading this message to who really are not interested in traveling right now. That's not an efficient use of the money. I talked a little earlier about we really want to be ROI-efficient in this. So I'm not sure -- certainly, when we think that enough people are ready to travel, then it'd be good to start pushing that message out to them. The critical thing is, when is that right point. We'll be measuring very carefully to see when that right time is. Well, I'll do the first one. I'll let Dave talk to the second one. The merchant platform will be very important, and that's why we do believe it's unimportant is to continue to invest in our payments product and get that out because, as you point out, providing value, providing the right price, putting it together through that connected trip. That's one of the things we've talked about a lot. We still believe this is a great thing for consumers, really being able to put together different packages in a way. So paying one way and clearly, one of the things, too, is us having more control over the cash makes it much easier if a refund is needed to be doing it from one thing instead of a customer having to deal with refunds from their air, from their hotel, from their car, maybe other things that are -- attractions. They did all different people they talked to try and get refund from. By doing in one package connected trip with us through our merchant payment platform, we'll be able to give much better value, both in the time when they buy it and even if they have to deal with getting a refund. So that's more important. And David, I'll let you talk about ADRs and what do you think. Sure. So regarding the brand advertising, I'm sure you'll forgive me for saying, I'm not -- I really don't want to give away exactly when we're going to put on the gas or what the signals are so our competitors can then get a jump on that. I'm sure you all understand that. Look, it is important, though, for us to feel that we are going to be effective in using that brand advertising and going through it. And as the question earlier about there's a lot of the things that we can do desktop now and be able to put out what is half video, half of -- half brand enhanced performance through video channels that you can start seeing some better response and a better sense of where your ROIs are not be able a little bit more selective in how you use that. I think we're going to definitely be pushing that way.  In regards to the supply relationships and the Great Recession as a model going forward, we were very pleased to see that -- and this is why we feel comfortable and confident to talk about how a deep recession can be helpful to distributors because in the past, the suppliers leaned in heavily into distributors who have demand for the obvious reason, that if you're a hotel and you're running 40% or 30% rate, you need to get that demand, and we're here to provide it to them. So that helps build that better relationship and I do think that's what you're going to see going forward. And I do agree. I think that some of them may not be doing as much brand advertising as perhaps they were in the past. That'd be due to cash constraints and other things where they need to make sure they're maintaining a certain amount of cash flow. Well, we like -- we always like having a strong balance sheet for many reasons, that being one of them. And of course, valuations, as we know, have changed drastically, but they've changed drastically for a reason. And so a risk factor is significantly increased than it was a short time ago. So our way we approach acquiring assets or any type of acquisition, is always the same, which is we measure in terms of what will add to our business for the franchise to help consumers and partners, what is that's going to be great. What do we think about management? Do we think they're good? Do we think they can help us or not? And if not, can we operate this or will this add without that management team? This is something that we always we built our company through M&A, as you know, and we're going to continue to look out for that. But we recognize that this is a frothy time, and we have to be careful and picky in terms of what we do because the risk factors are much higher now. And Dave, do you want to talk anything more about the balance sheet or no? Well, what we've seen is the hotel area, and Dave talked a little bit about what we've seen in that, a lot of air is still extremely limited, whether by government restrictions, like people to go to certain countries or the amount of flights and times available, and people just on fearful about getting on a clean right now. And you may have seen, for example, the RyanAir data that just came out in Europe, RyanAir is a good bellwether for air travel in Europe in April. It was essentially almost nothing, but really almost nothing. And that's, unfortunately, what we've seen in other parts of the world, extremely low amounts of air travel. But it's all will go somewhat together as people feel more comfortable about how their entire situation. It's the vaccine we talked about, it's a treatment perhaps, it's also in their economic situation, all those things. So I think what we'll see as things start coming back, yes, some things will be the other one. But I think overall, it will all come back pretty very similar. Thank you. I understand there was a technical difficulty. And some of the last part of my speech -- my prepared remarks was cut off. I think what actually works out well because the last 2 paragraphs, which were actually in a nice way to close this off. So let me disclose that all for everyone. Look, we know the progress against the pandemic is going to be disruptive at times as relaxation of social distancing in some geographies may lead to a resurgence of infections and/or reinstatement of government restrictions. Our aim is to optimize the business to participate in the ultimate return of demand, manage our expenses in light of our best estimate of the shape of that return, invest in our business to build on our leadership position in the industry and serve our customers, employees and partners and build shareholder value going forward.  We have a tough road ahead of us. And we have been through many difficult issues in the past, the last few weeks, and we're going to have some in the future, the weeks, the months and quarters to come. The pace scale and impact of COVID-19 is unprecedented. But we know one day, we will be on the other side, and we are doing everything we can to ensure we are well positioned to navigate through these challenging times. We have the confidence that with a highly variable cost structure, strong cash and liquidity, great global brand awareness and some of the best people anywhere, we are well positioned to come out of this crisis and extend our leadership role in the global travel ecosystem. Now I'm going to close by giving a heartfelt thank you to all the employees, our customers, our partners and the governments as we work through these difficult days together.  And to our employees, I have never been more proud of you and your enormous efforts to support our customers, partners everywhere. We know there will be more tough days ahead. Not just for us, but for so many people industries all over the world. But I am confident we will get through it. And lastly, I want to say thank you to all the frontline workers out there. The doctors and nurses, the scientists trying to come up with a cure or vaccine, the delivery people, the people making sure they'll be food in the stores, basically, to everybody in a job that is designated as critical. To all of you working night and day to help our will get through this. Thank you from all of us at Booking Holdings. Good night."

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Despite the appearance of the Omicron variant in late November and its rapid spread throughout Europe, the U.S. and other parts of the world, we closed out 2021 by delivering fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion and $940 million, respectively which were better than we expected. Room nights decelerated from down 10% in October compared to 2019 to down 35% in December. However, I am pleased to say that since December, we have seen a meaningful improvement in top line trends, with room nights in the first half of February reaching 2019 levels and with gross bookings higher than 2019. At Booking.com, I'm encouraged to see strong gross bookings on our books for the summer period in Western Europe and North America, both of which are now ahead of where we were at this time in 2019. Although I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable. 2021 was a year in which our hopes for a return to normalcy were set back several times, first with the Delta variant and then Omicron. However, we witnessed proof that people have a deep desire to travel. When leisure travelers believe it is safe to travel and restrictions are lifted, people book travel and we are currently seeing this starting to happen in many parts of the world. While this is a potentially favorable backdrop for 2022, we do expect there will still be periods when COVID negatively impacts travel trends as we move through the current year. David will provide additional details on our fourth quarter results and what we are seeing so far in the first quarter in his remarks. As I look back over the last year, I am proud of the work we have done under still difficult times to strengthen our core accommodation business by driving benefits to our traveler customers and to our supplier partners. For our customers, we remain focused on addressing our customers' critical needs of value, choice and convenience. One of the many ways we provide value for our customers and partners on Booking.com is through our Genius loyalty program. For our customers, our Genius loyalty program offers lower prices and other benefits like complimentary breakfast, room upgrades and discounted airport taxis. For our partners, our Genius program delivers incremental room nights to properties from our most loyal customers. Over the last year, we have meaningfully expanded our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com by opening the lowest level of Genius benefits to any customer who creates an account and is logged in on Booking.com. At the beginning of 2022, we fully launched a third tier of Genius for our top customers that made at least 15 bookings in the last two years. These Genius Level 3 members have access to even lower prices and priority customer service support in addition to all the benefits available to Genius Levels 1 and 2. These improvements to our Genius program are indicative of our efforts to move beyond just the transaction and increase our focus on value for the customer. With a higher degree of customer focus, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend and our direct relationships with our customers over time. Over the last year, we have enhanced Booking.com's mobile app, making it more user-friendly and easier to use. As I said before, the app is a critical platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. It is also where an increasing number of bookings are happening and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience. In 2021, Booking.com was the number one downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. For 2022, we are increasing our efforts to enhance the app in order to build on the success we saw over the last year. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we saw a consistently higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in 2019 and our direct mix improved even as we leaned into performance marketing channels during the year. We will continue to lean into performance marketing channels at appropriate ROIs as we look to bring more customer demand to our platform during the recovery. In addition to performance marketing, we will be utilizing brand marketing, particularly in markets where we are looking to raise consumer awareness of our customer-facing brands. A timely example of that which I hope all of you saw two weeks ago or so, was Booking.com's first Super Bowl ad in which we reintroduced the Booking slogan to our U.S. audience. We had a great year in the U.S. in 2021 with strong growth in room night and very strong growth in gross bookings versus 2019, even though Booking.com was relatively quiet from a brand marketing perspective. We are looking to accelerate the momentum of last year's performance by layering in brand marketing that extends beyond the Super Bowl ad through the rest of the year in order to introduce Booking.com to an even broader audience. As I mentioned last quarter, we have an ambition to acquire more customers in the medium intent space. We continue to work on strengthening our foundations for digital marketing, including in social channels. However, our spend so far remains relatively small. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform which means focusing on bringing incremental demand to properties from the broad audience of potential customers on our platform. For alternative accommodations, our global mix of room nights in 2021 of about 29% was in line with 2019 levels. In Europe, where our alternative accommodation offering is more competitive, our mix of room nights increased in 2021 by a few percentage points relative to 2019. We continue to work on improving the competitiveness of our alternative accommodation offering in the U.S. market, where we have added targeted supply over the last year and have plans for more additions and improvements to come in 2022. We closed out the year with 2.4 million hotel and alternative accommodation properties and over 28 million total reported listings on Booking.com, both of which were stable relative to the prior year. Let me now talk about the progress we have made over the last year in some of our key strategic priorities around payments and the connected trip. These strategic priorities are interrelated and we believe both will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth. On payments at Booking.com, we saw a further increase in adoption by our property partners in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, now with over half of U.S. gross bookings booked at properties that have adopted payments. Globally, about 60% of gross bookings are booked at properties that have adopted payments. About 30% of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q4 were processed through our payment platform which brings the full year 2021 mix to about 27% compared to about 22% for the full year 2020 and about 15% in 2019. We will continue our work on positioning Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment intermediary by providing payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, we see Booking.com's payment platform as a key component of our larger connected trip vision. On our connected trip vision, we made progress in 2021 as we work to build a robust flight platform on Booking.com. This flight platform gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these flight bookers. Flights also enables us to provide a more complete travel offering to our accommodation of customers. Booking.com's flight platform is now live in 34 countries which collectively represented about 70% of Booking.com's room nights booked in 2019. We continue to see that over 25% of Bookings flight bookers are entirely new customers to the platform. And of those new customers, an encouraging percentage are attaching an accommodation to their flight booking. These are positive early signals which help demonstrate that our flight offering can drive incremental new customers to us and we can cross-sell our accommodations product to them. We will continue our work to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity and build on the early positive signals we are seeing in flights. In November, we announced our intention to acquire Etraveli for \u20ac1.6 billion and we expect to close the transaction later this year pending regulatory approvals. Etraveli is one of the largest flight-centric online travel agencies and is a leader in flight booking technology. They've developed a comprehensive technology platform sourcing complex flight content from a variety of supply providers which is then distributed to consumer-facing sites. Booking.com and Etraveli have been successfully partnering over the last two years with Etraveli powering Bookings flight product. Given the strategic importance of flights to our connected trip offering, we believe it is critical to bring Etraveli flight expertise and technology in-house while also unlocking some of the limitations that exist in our current commercial agreement. When the deal closes, Etraveli will continue to operate as an independent company within Booking Holdings while further supporting the development of booking.com's flight platform. Outside of flights, Booking.com has significantly improved the coverage of its attractions product over the last year, in part due to the successful integration of third-party supply from Viator and Musement. We now have bookable attractions available in cities that represent about half of Booking.com's accommodation transactions which is up from about 10% coverage a year ago. While the volume of attractions bookings is still modest, we believe that developing a compelling, easy-to-use attractions product will help keep travelers engaged with our platform through the trip and build loyalty. We had a very busy end to 2021 and start to 2022, so I'd like to address a few other important recent updates. First, I am very excited to welcome the Getaroom team to Booking Holdings. We closed our $1.2 billion acquisition of Getaroom at the end of December and we are well underway with integrating Getaroom into Priceline, where it will help expand Priceline's current strategic partnerships business. Getaroom is a B2B-focused distributor of hotel rooms, primarily servicing leisure demand through about 150 affiliate partners primarily in the North American market. The B2B business is an important component and channel in our expansion efforts to reach new customers and partners, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. We believe B2B business can generate attractive returns by providing inventory to affiliate partners without the B2B business needing to invest significant dollars in brand marketing or online performance channels to generate customer demand. I am confident that the combined strategic partnership business of Priceline and Getaroom will improve B2B distribution for hotel partners while offering a robust accommodations technology stack for affiliate partners to help further enhance our offerings in North America. Second, some of you may have seen the news two weeks ago that Booking.com plans to enter into an expanded strategic partnership with Majorelle, one of our most trusted long-term external customer support partners. As part of this partnership which is still subject to consultation with works councils and regulatory approvals, Majorelle will begin employing most of the customer service representatives that previously worked for Booking.com outside The Netherlands and the U.K. We have been successfully working with Majorelle for six years in order to help meet the evolving seasonal demands of our business and we believe that this expanded partnership will help increase the flexibility and efficiency of our customer service offering going forward. Finally, on our last earnings call in early November, I discussed the urgency of tackling the global climate crisis and the importance of our industry coming together to work towards the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Shortly after that earnings call, Booking.com launched its Travel Sustainable Program. This is a first-of-its-kind program that features a travel-sustainable badge for any property on our platform that has implemented a combination of sustainable practices. When searching for accommodations, travelers can see whether or not a property has been given a travel-sustainable badge and can filter search results based on the badge. We believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through enabling our accommodation partners to showcase their sustainable practices to travelers who are looking for ways to travel more sustainably. We are looking forward to talking more about this program and other efforts and commitments related to sustainability when we publish our 2021 sustainability report and our first climate action plan in March. In conclusion, we executed well and produced strong results in 2021. As we look ahead to 2022, I am encouraged by the quick rebound in bookings we have seen so far this year and the level of summer travel on our books. While we expect to see some volatility in trends as a result of the ongoing effects of COVID, I am confident in the continued recovery in travel demand globally as there is clearly a very strong desire to travel among our leisure bookers. Of course, we are concerned and are monitoring the situation in Eastern Europe which we recognize could be disruptive to travelers who may be going to that region. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue capturing travel demand and we'll continue our work executing against our strategic priorities. As I have said before, we are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. And we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business with more products that generate some more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David?\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the fourth quarter; provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and our thoughts on 2022. All growth rates for 2021 and 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the fourth quarter. On our November earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends that we saw throughout the third quarter driven by Europe, followed by a further improvement in October driven by Asia. You will recall the trends weakened in Europe towards the end of October driven by a number of countries that have seen recent increases in the Delta variant infections at that time. In November, we saw a slowdown from October in our overall trends driven mainly by Europe and this slowdown continued to worsen in December across all regions with future Omicron variant concerns. This resulted in Q4 reported room nights declining 21% versus Q4 2019 which was 11% worse than the 10% decline in October but only a few points worse than the 18% decline in Q3. December room nights were 35% below 2019. Looking across the full quarter; the slowdown in Q4 versus Q3 was driven primarily by Europe which declined about 20% versus Q4 2019, while our other regions improved in Q4 versus Q3. Compared with Q4 2019, the U.S. continued to have strong growth in the fourth quarter, while Asia was still down considerably and rest of the world was down modestly. However, as I mentioned, we saw a slowdown across all of our regions in December, most meaningfully in Europe and in the U.S. Mobile bookings primarily through our apps represented 2/3 of our total room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our apps continue to represent an increasing majority of our mobile bookings. We all continue to see greater than 50% of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. Our direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year relative to 2020 and 2019. The international mix of our total room nights in Q4 was about 33%, in line with Q3. Q4 international room nights were down almost 50% compared to Q4 2019 levels, a few points worse than the decline in Q3. We continue to see growth in our domestic room nights in the fourth quarter, also a level slightly below Q3. The December slowdown was more severe for international than for domestic. Our cancellation rates were up a few percentage points versus 2019 in Q4 and for the full year and increased meaningfully in December due to concerns about the Omicron variant. The booking window in Q4 of Booking.com was much shorter than it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and contracted further in December as customers focused mainly on short-term travel needs. Alternative accommodation of Booking.com, the global mix of room nights is about 27% in Q4 and about 29% for the full year was in line with 2019 levels. The global mix was impacted by the underperformance of Europe relative to North America. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodations increased in Q4 by a couple of percentage points and for the full year, by a few percentage points relative to 2019. Gross fee declined 8% in Q4 which is less than the 21% decline in room nights due to an increase in average daily rates for accommodations on a constant currency basis of about 13% versus 2019 and very strong performance in our flights business. Our accommodation constant currency ADR benefited by about 4 percentage points from an increased mix of business in North America which is a higher-ADR region; and a decrease of mix in business in Asia which is a lower-ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up about 9% driven by rate increases in most of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America and especially in higher-demand, leisure-oriented destinations. Constant currency ADRs were higher than expected due in part to continued higher rates for flexible bookings plus generally higher pricing in North America and in Europe. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up 116% and for the full year, were up 104% versus 2019 driven by very strong growth of Priceline and by-flight bookings at Booking.com. We're encouraged to see a full year of triple-digit growth from our flights business which is a key component of our multiproduct connected trip strategy. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was almost $3 billion, down sequentially 36% from Q3 2021 and 11% below Q4 2019. Q4 2021 revenue was more than double the $1.2 billion of revenue we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020. Q4 revenue was stronger than our expectation due to higher ADRs and a shorter booking window. Revenue was less impacted than bookings from Omicron in Q4. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 40 basis points below Q4 2019 which was better than our expectations as the deceleration within Q4 more negatively impacted our gross bookings than revenue in the quarter. Excluding timing impacts, our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q4 2019 levels. Our full year revenue was almost $11 billion which is 27% below 2019 but improved 61% versus 2020. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.3% which was lower than 15.6% in 2019, primarily due to the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. The strong revenue results in the fourth quarter helped drive adjusted EBITDA of $940 million which was 27% below Q4 2019. Sequentially, Q4 EBITDA was down 55% which is better than we expected. This was driven primarily by the higher-than-expected revenue and lower-than-expected OpEx in our more fixed expense categories. Marketing expense which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 2% versus Q4 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings increased slightly versus 2019, in line with our expectations. The marketing ROIs were a little lower than our expectations due to the negative impact of cancellations late in the quarter and this was offset by a higher-than-expected mix of direct business. Sales and other expenses were 21% higher than Q4 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher outsourced call center costs. About 30% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q4 and about 27% for the full year, up from 22% in 2020. We expected our more fixed expense categories in aggregate to be about in line with Q3 due to lower personnel costs offset by higher IT and G&A costs. They came in 10% lower than Q3 due to year-end finalization of our bonus expense accruals as well as lower-than-expected IT costs. This means our Q4 personnel expenses do not reflect our run rates going into 2022. Non-GAAP net income of $554 million results in non-GAAP EPS of $15.83 which were down 32% versus Q4 2019. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 20% was higher than 18% in Q4 2019. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 20% was 1% higher than in 2019 due to a high proportion of nondeductible tax expenses -- nontax-deductible expenses in relation to a lower pretax income versus 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $848 million in Q4. We recorded GAAP net income of $618 million in the quarter which included income tax expense of $198 million. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance of $14.3 billion was down versus our Q3 ending balance of $15.4 billion primarily driven by the $1.2 billion Getaroom acquisition, partially offset by positive free cash flow of about $178 million. Two housekeeping notes about Getaroom. The first is that it closed at the end of Q4 and was not meaningful to Q4 results. The second is that we did not include the incremental room nights from Getaroom in our commentary about January and February. These incremental room nights will be included when we release our Q1 actual results. In early January, we started returning capital to shareholders under our remaining authorization and have to date purchased about $500 million. Assuming that travel recovery continues, we still expect to complete our remaining organization within the next three years. Now on to our thoughts for the first quarter. And to remind you, we'll make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. January room nights declined about 22%, an improvement from the 35% decline in December as concerns around the Omicron variant eased. This improvement was driven primarily by a recovery in cross-border travel within the European region and domestic travel in Europe. We saw room nights trends improving throughout January and continuing into February. Our room nights in the first half of February were about in line with 2019 levels and gross bookings were higher. In the first half of February, we saw a meaningful improvement across all of our regions compared to January. The U.S. has strong room night growth versus 2019 in the first half of February, while Europe had about 10% growth. Rest of the world was up slightly and Asia was down about 35%. Our mix of international room night recovered from about 23% in December to over 40% in the first half of February which is the highest international mix we've seen since the start of COVID. As a reminder, our pre-COVID international mix was just over 50%. As I mentioned, the improvements we see in the first half of February are broad-based with large countries in Europe and international travel routes within Europe driving the largest impact. The new cross-border bookings we're seeing in Q1 in Europe on average have a longer length of stay and a shorter booking window than comparable bookings in 2019. As we've seen throughout the pandemic, when travel restrictions are lifted and traveler confidence increases, bookings improve quite quickly. Given the rapid changes during the first half of Q1, it's difficult to predict how room nights for the remainder of the quarter will develop. While it's encouraging to see the recent improvements, we are still in a potentially volatile environment with high COVID infection rates in some part of the world and geopolitical uncertainty that could impact our business, especially in Europe. So far in Q1, the overall booking window of Booking.com has contracted less versus 2019 than it did in Q4. We've seen recent strength in our summer booking trends and our gross bookings for the summer are higher than they were at this time in 2019. The summer booking trends are stronger in Western Europe, where gross bookings for the same period are up double digits versus 2019 and gross bookings for the U.S. are also higher for the summer than they were at this time in 2019. Of course, a very high percentage of all bookings for summer are cancelable, so things could change rapidly. Turning to the income statements; we expect the change in gross bookings in Q1 versus 2019 to be several percentage points better than the change in room nights due to an increase in ADRs and very strong flight bookings. Constant currency ADRs in Q1 so far have increased versus 2019 at a similar rate to Q4. We expect Q1 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 1.5 percentage points lower than in Q1 2019 as the booking deceleration in Q4 negatively impacts revenue -- negatively impact on revenue and the booking recovery in Q1 benefits revenue in future quarters. This 1.5 percentage points of difference in revenue as percentage gross bookings could be higher if booking trends increased meaningfully from the first half of February, especially if a high percentage of these bookings offer stays in future quarters. We expect margin expenses in Q1 will trend about in line with gross bookings compared to Q1 2019. We expect sales and other expense in Q1 as a percentage of gross bookings to be about the same as it was in Q4. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 15% higher in Q1 than in Q4 on a dollar basis due to the impact of seasonal increase in benefit costs, the 2021 year-end personnel-related accrual finalizations and the impact of planned hiring as well as increases in IT expenses, including some deferral from Q4. In my just explained and reminding you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be positive but down sequentially from Q4 significantly more than the sequential declines we saw pre-COVID primarily due to the impact of Omicron on Q1 revenues. As we think about the full year ahead, we're encouraged about the strong summer bookings we're seeing so far and we're optimistic about the continued recovery of later travel. However, we do expect continued volatility in our top line trends driven by COVID. There are other uncertainties on the horizon, including the current geopolitical situation which could impact travel. If we look at Russia and Ukraine combined as destination markets, they represent a very low single-digit percentage of our total gross bookings. All this makes it very difficult to predict how the top line will progress during the year and how the full year will turn out. As we think about the recovery of travel in 2022 and the opportunity in front of us, we plan to invest in marketing other incentives and improvements and expansion of our products to attract existing and new customers to our platforms and to drive additional loyalty in the future. This also requires investments in people and technology. We're excited about the opportunity to expand our business and we believe we can strengthen our position in accommodations and build a much more complete travel solution for our customers and partners. We believe this is the right thing to do for higher longer-term returns from our business. With this in mind, there are a few factors to consider when thinking about shape of the P&L for the full year. These fall into four buckets; revenue, marketing, sales and other expenses and our more fixed operating expenses. Starting with revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, we expect this to be higher in 2022 than it was in 2021 but lower than in 2019. In 2021, our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points lower than 2019, mainly due to timing differences between the recovery of gross bookings and revenue. In 2022, we expect this timing to be less of an impact than it was in 2021. Moving to marketing; there are a number of factors that come into play. We expect the environment to remain competitive, especially as the leisure travel market moves closer towards full recovery. We intend to remain disciplined in our performance marketing ROIs and we'll continue to invest in developing the medium intent social media channels and you'll see us active in branding in the U.S. and other major markets. Our goal continues to be to use our marketing strength to gain share in markets where we can with reasonable returns. We expect to run initiatives and programs during the year to attract both existing and new customers to our platforms. It's difficult to know exactly how these factors will play out across the year but we expect marketing as a percentage of gross bookings to be a little higher than it was in 2019 and also in 2021. Of course, an increasing direct mix helps our marketing efficiency and we believe the investments we're making will result in a higher direct mix over time. Turning to sales not expenses; we expect these to be up 50 basis points higher than in 2021 as a percentage of gross bookings. This is mainly from additional payment processing costs but also impacted by anticipated higher third-party customer service expenses. The additional expenses related to payments are offset by a higher payment-related revenue. The last area is our more fixed operating expenses which include personnel, G&A and IT. We expect our personnel expenses to be impacted by higher-than-average annual wage increases, especially in the product and technology areas; and by planned headcount increasing in key areas, including product and technology and bond-related functions. We expect personnel expenses to be about 10% higher than in 2021. We expect that G&A and IT will both grow faster than personnel driven by a number of factors, including digital services taxes, returning to a hybrid work environment and the investments to enhance our customer and partner-facing and internal systems. The comments we made for 2022 do not include the anticipated reduction to personnel expense and increases to sale and other expense from the enhanced strategic partnership with Majorelle that Glenn spoke about. We do not anticipate much of an impact on adjusted EBITDA in 2022 from this initiative and we'll update you again in May. Also, we expect our acquisition of Getaroom to have a small positive impact on our P&L in 2022. As Glenn noted, we expect that the Etraveli acquisition will close later this year which will result in a minor impact to the P&L in 2022. So when thinking about the shape of the P&L in 2022, these factors mean that revenue recovery will lag the gross bookings recovery and EBITDA recovery will lag revenue recovery. Some of the lag in EBITDA versus revenue is timing, i.e. the marketing we spend on bookings we expect to recover ahead of revenue. On top of this, we plan to make investments in customer acquisition and in expanding our product offerings we mentioned earlier. Taken together, we expect our EBITDA margins in 2022 to be a few points higher than we were in 2021. Looking beyond 2022, we continue to remain focused on investing to build a larger and faster-growing business with more products than we had pre-COVID that delivers more EBITDA dollars and more earnings per share with industry-leading EBITDA margins. In closing, we're confident in our ability to capture demand as the global travel market recovers and to execute against our strategic priorities. With that, we'll take your questions. And Chris, I'll turn the call over to you for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great to see your bookings back to '19 levels. I know there's a lot of thought about what booking looks like post-travel recovery. So I'm wondering if we could revisit some of the things you're thinking about, what the business could look like as far as booking levels and margins when we get back to normal. And I know you've made a couple of acquisitions. I'm sure you're excited about those. And obviously, your connected vision trip seems to be in the right direction. So maybe we could revisit how you're thinking about the absolute number -- the absolute value of bookings and also what the absolute level of EBITDA could look like once we get to a full recovery.\nGlenn Fogel: Why don't I let David handle the margin. Though he did -- he just said it in his prepared remarks. I'll let him say it again.\nDavid Goulden: Justin, let me give you a little bit more color. And I appreciate the question. So we are focused upon, as I said, growing a business that is larger than it was in 2019. It's more diverse in terms of product offerings. It's growing faster than it was in 2019. It has more absolute EBITDA dollars and EPS dollars. That's our focus. We've given you obviously some color where things go in 2022. We expect that we can expand our volume beyond 2022. And we expect that once we are kind of to normal in that final state, we'll have industry-leading EBITDA margins. But beyond that, we don't want to get too specific about exactly what they're going to be other than our goal is to give more EBITDA dollars, more EPS dollars that are growing faster than they were pre-COVID.\nJustin Post: Great. And then the two acquisitions you made, one you closed and one is still open. How are you thinking about those? Are those areas that are really going to help you save costs? Or do you think those are actually booking drivers?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, they're really two different acquisitions, Justin. Why don't I take them separately. So the Getaroom one, as I described in my prepared remarks, is very much adding to what we already have at Priceline in a B2B business that helps bring in customers that we wouldn't have gotten through our other marketing programs, whether it be pay-for-performance or brand. These customers are coming from affiliates. And there are contracts that Getaroom had and different technologies they have that by bringing them in is going to get us additional business that we wouldn't have gotten otherwise. On Etraveli, that was a different situation where, as I pointed out many times, how important it is for us to have this connected trip vision fulfilled. And one of the critical parts of it is our flight business. And we absolutely are very pleased to see not only the growth in our number of flight bookings but also the fact the number of new customers getting coming and the number who are then buying an accommodation. Now Etraveli has been powering the Booking.com product for two years. Great technology. They do a lot of things that could we recreate on our own? Probably it would take a long time, would require us to use resources that we want to use elsewhere. So by acquiring Etraveli, we're going to bring that technology in-house and be able to do things that we couldn't do when we were just a commercial partner. So I'm looking very forward to having that close and hopefully, as we said, in the future and then really began to develop a great, great combination.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Lloyd Wamsley of UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Two, if I can. First, can you give us just an update around how you're thinking about timing for adding some of the value-added features to payments that could drive positive contribution to the P&L? And is it safe to say that even if you pass some of that cost, some of that margin along to consumers, it would likely drive faster growth and therefore, revenue, even if it wasn't directly revenue margin-accretive? And then the second question would be, can you maybe give us some color around the benefits of connected trip beyond incremental revenue from adding new products? So what do you see with repeat rates or direct rates among users who adopt multiple products? Anything you could share there would be great.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure, Lloyd. Two separate questions. Let me talk a little bit about the payments product and what we're developing and how it's going and I'll let David add a little more to it. I'm sure he want to add some more specifics. Clearly, we've talked about this in the past that one of the critical things is enabling a customer to be able to pay in the way they want to pay and enabling the supplier to get paid in the way they want to get paid. So right way, getting that out in the market enables us to have more business. Then you go beyond that and you see do it cheaper for our suppliers, do it in a way is cheaper than they're doing it right now the way they're doing their payments the way they're getting it through our old agency model Booking.com and finding a way that we can do that in a way that not only improves their business because they'll not to pay as much but obviously, we'll make a little out of that, too. But then it goes much more beyond and that is the connected trip. The connected trip doesn't work if you don't have payments because we need to put it all together in one payment that we can then handle on our own. And particularly, if there's anything goes wrong, we don't have to undo it, too. That's really going to be helpful to us. And then it's not just payments but it's our fintech unit which is the payments people but doing more things; it's coming in and helping out in flexible-type products. People want a flexible product. They can cancel us. Creating that on our own is something we'll be doing more so in the future. There are a number of different things we can do that will absolutely increase both the ease of use, the convenience and enable us to make more money out of it. And I'll pause there and let David, if he wants to add anything more to that.\nDavid Goulden: I think, Glenn, you did a great summary of the interconnectivity between those two and the new areas. A lot on timing. Nothing major in terms of market impact in 2022. We're still in building mode for some of those value-added products that you mentioned. And market entry where you might see any impact will be more into the 2023-2024 time frame.\nGlenn Fogel: Then to the second thing, Lloyd, in terms of the connected trip, step one is build out the verticals. We didn't have flights a couple of years ago on Booking.com at all. And as you can tell by the numbers I put out, we still don't have 100% coverage for all the areas that we do accommodations. Have to build that out. Also just some of the technologies at Etraveli, we have a lot of things we can do to just improve that product. I talked a little bit about the attractions product where we had only 10% coverage last year. Now we made a lot of good progress to 50%. We had to put that all out. And then there are other areas, ground transportation, other parts of the trip. So we're building out all the verticals first to make sure we have the supply, make sure it works well, et cetera. At the same time, we are beginning, as I pointed out, about the people who get flights and then buy in a combination, we are doing some of that cross-selling and bringing that out. We'll do more and more. The goal, of course, is to make it so that it is so seamless, so frictionless that people when they're using Booking.com or any kind of trials we're doing, they're finding easier and offering more value. And that value comes from suppliers being willing to chime in to our platform and be able to offer different things that we can then very, very scientifically target at different customers in a way that gets an incremental customer to that supplier. The customer is happy, the supplier is happy and we, of course, make money. That will develop the loyalty, that will develop the direct business and that's where we're going for. And it's the same way in other parts of e-commerce where people don't shop around, they don't look around. They go to one player because they know that's the place where they're going to get the most value easiest to you, et cetera. And that's what we're going for. It's going to take some time but I love the progress that we're making.\nDavid Goulden: And Glenn, I'd just add to that as well that when we kind of look at our customer base and not too surprisingly, our top customers, the ones who can spend the most with us, uses most often are more likely to use multiple things, more likely to use the app and a much more likely to interest directly. So that's the model that we're trying to build upon to build the loyalty that Glenn mentioned. And we do have good evidence that, that is a trend that we can build on. And the more we build value, complete travel offering, frequency, direct linkage via the app, the more loyal those customers become.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kevin Kopelman of Cowen & Company.\nKevin Kopelman: I had a follow-up on the latest recovery trends. Based on all the data that you have, do you have a sense of to what extent the strong booking numbers you saw in the first half of February reflect sustainable levels that you could see going forward in the coming months as opposed to kind of a short-term catch-up after the Omicron pressure that you saw in December and the start of the year? And as a follow-up to that, to what extent are travel restrictions that are still in place in many European countries still hurting booking activity based on the data that you've got?\nGlenn Fogel: Kevin, so I think it's very difficult for anybody to have a perfect crystal ball into exactly what is driving the good numbers that David talked about for the first half of February. However, I think we can all feel fairly certain that there's a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for travel. For several years, people have not been able to travel the way they wanted to travel. Savings are up so people have cash. And I hear it anecdotally. I hear it when I talk to CEOs in the industry, what they're seeing, what they're hearing. I think everybody feels that people want to travel. And I don't think I would just see this as just a little bit of an Omicron rebound is what we're seeing. I think what we're seeing is people being able to travel, restrictions are going down, people are feeling safer. There are some new things coming out that will reduce the frictions in -- further in Europe. There's an announcement by the EU counsel about wanting to suggest getting rid of some of the restrictions. Those things all help people feel better about travel. And of course, though, there are parts of the world that are still having problems. And eventually, those are going to go down, too. So I feel good about the demand. I feel good about the future of travel. That being said, David made -- mentioned it several times, there are a lot of uncertainty still about how linear this is going to be. And I think we have to all look back at the past one. Many times, we thought things were out of the woods and then we weren't out of the woods. And of course, David also mentioned and I mentioned there are some macro events happening in different parts of the world that can also impact travel. So I think we all have to be cautious but optimistic. Here's the thing I absolutely do know, though, the long run. I know in the long run, we're going to do well in travel. People are going to come back. You can't stop that demand in the human being that wants to travel. How fast? We can't be certain but I am confident in our future.\nKevin Kopelman: Could you comment on the travel restriction piece in Europe? To what extent are you still seeing restrictions in Europe still limiting some of the activity? Or is that pretty much up already?\nGlenn Fogel: No, it's not completely done. The different countries -- you had different counties and I look at the list all the time. Some places are letting them up completely. U.K., you're probably aware; other places, still some. And the question is, do you need to take a test before you show up or not? If you're vaccinated but you're not vaccinated with an EU-approved vaccination here with the WHO vaccination approval, what's the difference there, all these things. But I think a lot of this stuff is going to be going away. And I hope, I hope in other parts of the world also, that these restrictions around the world can go down as quickly as possible. Australia, for example, was letting tourists back in and you maybe you saw some of those happy, happy photographs. Look, the fact is that I do not believe and I've seen a lot of data on this, that the restrictions on travel and this comes from the WHO and other authoritative sources, that travel restrictions do not have a significant impact on reducing the amount of infections in countries. And therefore, given the social costs, financial costs, et cetera, a lot of these restrictions should be lifted.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan.\nDouglas Anmuth: One for Glenn and one for David. Glenn, was just hoping you could talk about the elevated brand strategy in the U.S. and just how the approach differs here versus in previous years. And then also any comments just framing the broader marketing landscape as you go into stronger recovery. And then, David, unless I missed it, I was just curious on any financial implications from expanding the customer service partnership with Majorelle.\nGlenn Fogel: So Doug, I heard the second part a little bit about the brand marketing but I didn't hear the first part. Let me answer the brand and our general marketing approach in the U.S. going forward and then maybe give me -- say again the beginning part there. Clearly, you saw that we didn't do a lot of brand marketing at the worst of the pandemic. And obviously, there's no reason to spend that money. And now with the recovery coming, we're coming back. And I'm very pleased with what we saw with our sub add-on. It's very, very early but I'm pleased with the numbers and what I've seen so far. And so we are stepping back into a more normal marketing approach as we did in 2019. That being said, we're always going to do what we've already done which is, look, where do we think we're going to get the best return for our marketing dollars. And we continue to evaluate what's going to give us the greatest return. But one thing that we have been changing over time and that is not looking just for the immediate transaction seeing what are we doing in terms of building out the long term, the loyalty, the repeat business, the coming back direct and being able to measure where that person came from and what they do after that. So we're a little more scientific in it than perhaps we were in the past for the long run but I'm pleased with that because I think that's what we need to do to really build the franchise and increase the value of the company. The first part -- what's the first part, Doug, you asked about?\nDouglas Anmuth: I think you hit the brand strategy pretty well. The second part I wanted to ask about the customer service partnership expansion and just financial implication.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. David, still there?\nDavid Goulden: So let me take that. So first of all, let's put this into context. We -- this is to do with Booking.com. So Booking.com, we've been working with external service providers for a long period of time. And you may or may not know that when we get to our peak periods, the majority of our customer contacts actually handled by our XL partners. So for example, typically, last summer, we had about 75% of the CS contacts were handled by EXLP. So this is not something new. It's just something have a little bit more accelerated. Financial impacts, do not expect much in 2022. We're still working through, as Glenn said, through approvals and the close process, then there will be a transition period. Going forward, 2023 and 2024, this is more about potentially having the ability to have -- let the cost increase than in the past but the cost driver is not really the driver for doing this. It's really about ability. We have incredible variability in our workload from peak periods to low periods. And to run an in-house CS team is quite inefficient and also isn't the best employee experience for our workers because -- so they are experiencing peaks and troughs and the Korea development is also restricted because it's a very in-house group. So the bigger factor is really our flexibility, giving a bigger pool of opportunity for our employees and then with that comes some cost -- potential cost benefits in the form of lower increases as we ramp up the volumes.\nGlenn Fogel: And I would just add one other thing is we still believe absolutely the importance of great customer service. This has nothing to do with changing that. We're still going to be doing the technology that goes into the customer service process, our policies, all those things we're doing that. Also, it's looking to the future but we hope to build a very big company. The idea of then having to build a very big internal customer service operation is just not the best use of our resources, our managerial capabilities. This is something that is better done by people who are experts in that and can really do it better than we can do it but we can still provide all the great things in the actual customer service to the customer. It's definitely a win-win.\nOperator: Our next question from Mark Mahaney of Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: Two questions, please. That 9% constant currency ADR growth, I think that's the highest I've ever heard you talk about. And I guess that's -- and if I'm right, maybe that's not surprising given what's happened to overall inflation rates being at decade-highs. So when you think about this year, what are you assuming in terms of the sustainability of that? Maybe I'm even asking whether inflation is temporary or permanent. So just your thoughts on what do you expect to happen with ADR. Like when you -- when you're running your business, what are your assumptions? And then the second thing I want to ask is, David, when you talk about the ability of Booking to grow post the recovery, to grow faster than it did in 2019. And if that were to actually happen, what would be the biggest drivers of that? Like what would be the greatest things I would cause on the top line, the business, to grow faster post-COVID than it did pre-COVID?\nDavid Goulden: Sure, Mark. Let me take both of those. So yes, the 9% constant currency ADR growth was actually adjusted for basically geo mix, right, so same country. And that is a strong number. We experienced 9% ADR growth last year, again, versus 2019. So it's quite possible ADR is going to be at or higher than they were in 2021. I mentioned what the factors were. I mentioned the fact it was higher than our expectations. Do you think that the rates would start to tail off a little bit when we got into the -- got the high season where obviously, there was more supply relative to demand but the rates continue to hold up. And as I mentioned, flexible rates are still at a premium. But just underneath that, there was basically just higher prices, particularly in the left-oriented, high-demand areas remain strong. So we think that ADR is likely to be as high in '22 as we were in '21 compared to 2019. And then in terms of faster growth, I mean there are a number of factors there. We do believe that it can take together. We believe that there's further growth for us in the accommodation business, both on a geographic point of view, expanding our offering into alternative accommodations and adding on to that all the benefits from the connected trip, what we can do on top of that because of payments because of the fact we offer a more complete offering, thinking about more targeted ways to customize a complete solution for our customers, our pricing, payments, customer service. We think that we are solving today a relatively small part of the total travel equation and the potential for us to solve more of that is what's going to drive more growth, basically create a better product, a better service, have customers coming to us more frequently, increasing loyalty. They all work together to provide what we think is a great growth opportunity for us.\nOperator: At this time, I would now like to turn the conference back to Glenn Fogel for his concluding remarks. You may proceed.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. We are very pleased with 2021. It was a volatile and difficult year but it showed progress. And as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you and good night.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference. Thank you, everyone for participating. You may now all disconnect.",

            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the fourth quarter; provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and our thoughts on 2022. All growth rates for 2021 and 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the fourth quarter. On our November earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends that we saw throughout the third quarter driven by Europe, followed by a further improvement in October driven by Asia. You will recall the trends weakened in Europe towards the end of October driven by a number of countries that have seen recent increases in the Delta variant infections at that time. In November, we saw a slowdown from October in our overall trends driven mainly by Europe and this slowdown continued to worsen in December across all regions with future Omicron variant concerns. This resulted in Q4 reported room nights declining 21% versus Q4 2019 which was 11% worse than the 10% decline in October but only a few points worse than the 18% decline in Q3. December room nights were 35% below 2019. Looking across the full quarter; the slowdown in Q4 versus Q3 was driven primarily by Europe which declined about 20% versus Q4 2019, while our other regions improved in Q4 versus Q3. Compared with Q4 2019, the U.S. continued to have strong growth in the fourth quarter, while Asia was still down considerably and rest of the world was down modestly. However, as I mentioned, we saw a slowdown across all of our regions in December, most meaningfully in Europe and in the U.S. Mobile bookings primarily through our apps represented 2/3 of our total room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our apps continue to represent an increasing majority of our mobile bookings. We all continue to see greater than 50% of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. Our direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year relative to 2020 and 2019. The international mix of our total room nights in Q4 was about 33%, in line with Q3. Q4 international room nights were down almost 50% compared to Q4 2019 levels, a few points worse than the decline in Q3. We continue to see growth in our domestic room nights in the fourth quarter, also a level slightly below Q3. The December slowdown was more severe for international than for domestic. Our cancellation rates were up a few percentage points versus 2019 in Q4 and for the full year and increased meaningfully in December due to concerns about the Omicron variant. The booking window in Q4 of Booking.com was much shorter than it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and contracted further in December as customers focused mainly on short-term travel needs. Alternative accommodation of Booking.com, the global mix of room nights is about 27% in Q4 and about 29% for the full year was in line with 2019 levels. The global mix was impacted by the underperformance of Europe relative to North America. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodations increased in Q4 by a couple of percentage points and for the full year, by a few percentage points relative to 2019. Gross fee declined 8% in Q4 which is less than the 21% decline in room nights due to an increase in average daily rates for accommodations on a constant currency basis of about 13% versus 2019 and very strong performance in our flights business. Our accommodation constant currency ADR benefited by about 4 percentage points from an increased mix of business in North America which is a higher-ADR region; and a decrease of mix in business in Asia which is a lower-ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up about 9% driven by rate increases in most of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America and especially in higher-demand, leisure-oriented destinations. Constant currency ADRs were higher than expected due in part to continued higher rates for flexible bookings plus generally higher pricing in North America and in Europe. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up 116% and for the full year, were up 104% versus 2019 driven by very strong growth of Priceline and by-flight bookings at Booking.com. We're encouraged to see a full year of triple-digit growth from our flights business which is a key component of our multiproduct connected trip strategy. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was almost $3 billion, down sequentially 36% from Q3 2021 and 11% below Q4 2019. Q4 2021 revenue was more than double the $1.2 billion of revenue we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020. Q4 revenue was stronger than our expectation due to higher ADRs and a shorter booking window. Revenue was less impacted than bookings from Omicron in Q4. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 40 basis points below Q4 2019 which was better than our expectations as the deceleration within Q4 more negatively impacted our gross bookings than revenue in the quarter. Excluding timing impacts, our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q4 2019 levels. Our full year revenue was almost $11 billion which is 27% below 2019 but improved 61% versus 2020. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.3% which was lower than 15.6% in 2019, primarily due to the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. The strong revenue results in the fourth quarter helped drive adjusted EBITDA of $940 million which was 27% below Q4 2019. Sequentially, Q4 EBITDA was down 55% which is better than we expected. This was driven primarily by the higher-than-expected revenue and lower-than-expected OpEx in our more fixed expense categories. Marketing expense which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 2% versus Q4 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings increased slightly versus 2019, in line with our expectations. The marketing ROIs were a little lower than our expectations due to the negative impact of cancellations late in the quarter and this was offset by a higher-than-expected mix of direct business. Sales and other expenses were 21% higher than Q4 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher outsourced call center costs. About 30% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q4 and about 27% for the full year, up from 22% in 2020. We expected our more fixed expense categories in aggregate to be about in line with Q3 due to lower personnel costs offset by higher IT and G&A costs. They came in 10% lower than Q3 due to year-end finalization of our bonus expense accruals as well as lower-than-expected IT costs. This means our Q4 personnel expenses do not reflect our run rates going into 2022. Non-GAAP net income of $554 million results in non-GAAP EPS of $15.83 which were down 32% versus Q4 2019. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 20% was higher than 18% in Q4 2019. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 20% was 1% higher than in 2019 due to a high proportion of nondeductible tax expenses -- nontax-deductible expenses in relation to a lower pretax income versus 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $848 million in Q4. We recorded GAAP net income of $618 million in the quarter which included income tax expense of $198 million. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance of $14.3 billion was down versus our Q3 ending balance of $15.4 billion primarily driven by the $1.2 billion Getaroom acquisition, partially offset by positive free cash flow of about $178 million. Two housekeeping notes about Getaroom. The first is that it closed at the end of Q4 and was not meaningful to Q4 results. The second is that we did not include the incremental room nights from Getaroom in our commentary about January and February. These incremental room nights will be included when we release our Q1 actual results. In early January, we started returning capital to shareholders under our remaining authorization and have to date purchased about $500 million. Assuming that travel recovery continues, we still expect to complete our remaining organization within the next three years. Now on to our thoughts for the first quarter. And to remind you, we'll make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. January room nights declined about 22%, an improvement from the 35% decline in December as concerns around the Omicron variant eased. This improvement was driven primarily by a recovery in cross-border travel within the European region and domestic travel in Europe. We saw room nights trends improving throughout January and continuing into February. Our room nights in the first half of February were about in line with 2019 levels and gross bookings were higher. In the first half of February, we saw a meaningful improvement across all of our regions compared to January. The U.S. has strong room night growth versus 2019 in the first half of February, while Europe had about 10% growth. Rest of the world was up slightly and Asia was down about 35%. Our mix of international room night recovered from about 23% in December to over 40% in the first half of February which is the highest international mix we've seen since the start of COVID. As a reminder, our pre-COVID international mix was just over 50%. As I mentioned, the improvements we see in the first half of February are broad-based with large countries in Europe and international travel routes within Europe driving the largest impact. The new cross-border bookings we're seeing in Q1 in Europe on average have a longer length of stay and a shorter booking window than comparable bookings in 2019. As we've seen throughout the pandemic, when travel restrictions are lifted and traveler confidence increases, bookings improve quite quickly. Given the rapid changes during the first half of Q1, it's difficult to predict how room nights for the remainder of the quarter will develop. While it's encouraging to see the recent improvements, we are still in a potentially volatile environment with high COVID infection rates in some part of the world and geopolitical uncertainty that could impact our business, especially in Europe. So far in Q1, the overall booking window of Booking.com has contracted less versus 2019 than it did in Q4. We've seen recent strength in our summer booking trends and our gross bookings for the summer are higher than they were at this time in 2019. The summer booking trends are stronger in Western Europe, where gross bookings for the same period are up double digits versus 2019 and gross bookings for the U.S. are also higher for the summer than they were at this time in 2019. Of course, a very high percentage of all bookings for summer are cancelable, so things could change rapidly. Turning to the income statements; we expect the change in gross bookings in Q1 versus 2019 to be several percentage points better than the change in room nights due to an increase in ADRs and very strong flight bookings. Constant currency ADRs in Q1 so far have increased versus 2019 at a similar rate to Q4. We expect Q1 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 1.5 percentage points lower than in Q1 2019 as the booking deceleration in Q4 negatively impacts revenue -- negatively impact on revenue and the booking recovery in Q1 benefits revenue in future quarters. This 1.5 percentage points of difference in revenue as percentage gross bookings could be higher if booking trends increased meaningfully from the first half of February, especially if a high percentage of these bookings offer stays in future quarters. We expect margin expenses in Q1 will trend about in line with gross bookings compared to Q1 2019. We expect sales and other expense in Q1 as a percentage of gross bookings to be about the same as it was in Q4. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 15% higher in Q1 than in Q4 on a dollar basis due to the impact of seasonal increase in benefit costs, the 2021 year-end personnel-related accrual finalizations and the impact of planned hiring as well as increases in IT expenses, including some deferral from Q4. In my just explained and reminding you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be positive but down sequentially from Q4 significantly more than the sequential declines we saw pre-COVID primarily due to the impact of Omicron on Q1 revenues. As we think about the full year ahead, we're encouraged about the strong summer bookings we're seeing so far and we're optimistic about the continued recovery of later travel. However, we do expect continued volatility in our top line trends driven by COVID. There are other uncertainties on the horizon, including the current geopolitical situation which could impact travel. If we look at Russia and Ukraine combined as destination markets, they represent a very low single-digit percentage of our total gross bookings. All this makes it very difficult to predict how the top line will progress during the year and how the full year will turn out. As we think about the recovery of travel in 2022 and the opportunity in front of us, we plan to invest in marketing other incentives and improvements and expansion of our products to attract existing and new customers to our platforms and to drive additional loyalty in the future. This also requires investments in people and technology. We're excited about the opportunity to expand our business and we believe we can strengthen our position in accommodations and build a much more complete travel solution for our customers and partners. We believe this is the right thing to do for higher longer-term returns from our business. With this in mind, there are a few factors to consider when thinking about shape of the P&L for the full year. These fall into four buckets; revenue, marketing, sales and other expenses and our more fixed operating expenses. Starting with revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, we expect this to be higher in 2022 than it was in 2021 but lower than in 2019. In 2021, our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points lower than 2019, mainly due to timing differences between the recovery of gross bookings and revenue. In 2022, we expect this timing to be less of an impact than it was in 2021. Moving to marketing; there are a number of factors that come into play. We expect the environment to remain competitive, especially as the leisure travel market moves closer towards full recovery. We intend to remain disciplined in our performance marketing ROIs and we'll continue to invest in developing the medium intent social media channels and you'll see us active in branding in the U.S. and other major markets. Our goal continues to be to use our marketing strength to gain share in markets where we can with reasonable returns. We expect to run initiatives and programs during the year to attract both existing and new customers to our platforms. It's difficult to know exactly how these factors will play out across the year but we expect marketing as a percentage of gross bookings to be a little higher than it was in 2019 and also in 2021. Of course, an increasing direct mix helps our marketing efficiency and we believe the investments we're making will result in a higher direct mix over time. Turning to sales not expenses; we expect these to be up 50 basis points higher than in 2021 as a percentage of gross bookings. This is mainly from additional payment processing costs but also impacted by anticipated higher third-party customer service expenses. The additional expenses related to payments are offset by a higher payment-related revenue. The last area is our more fixed operating expenses which include personnel, G&A and IT. We expect our personnel expenses to be impacted by higher-than-average annual wage increases, especially in the product and technology areas; and by planned headcount increasing in key areas, including product and technology and bond-related functions. We expect personnel expenses to be about 10% higher than in 2021. We expect that G&A and IT will both grow faster than personnel driven by a number of factors, including digital services taxes, returning to a hybrid work environment and the investments to enhance our customer and partner-facing and internal systems. The comments we made for 2022 do not include the anticipated reduction to personnel expense and increases to sale and other expense from the enhanced strategic partnership with Majorelle that Glenn spoke about. We do not anticipate much of an impact on adjusted EBITDA in 2022 from this initiative and we'll update you again in May. Also, we expect our acquisition of Getaroom to have a small positive impact on our P&L in 2022. As Glenn noted, we expect that the Etraveli acquisition will close later this year which will result in a minor impact to the P&L in 2022. So when thinking about the shape of the P&L in 2022, these factors mean that revenue recovery will lag the gross bookings recovery and EBITDA recovery will lag revenue recovery. Some of the lag in EBITDA versus revenue is timing, i.e. the marketing we spend on bookings we expect to recover ahead of revenue. On top of this, we plan to make investments in customer acquisition and in expanding our product offerings we mentioned earlier. Taken together, we expect our EBITDA margins in 2022 to be a few points higher than we were in 2021. Looking beyond 2022, we continue to remain focused on investing to build a larger and faster-growing business with more products than we had pre-COVID that delivers more EBITDA dollars and more earnings per share with industry-leading EBITDA margins. In closing, we're confident in our ability to capture demand as the global travel market recovers and to execute against our strategic priorities. With that, we'll take your questions. And Chris, I'll turn the call over to you for Q&A. Justin, let me give you a little bit more color. And I appreciate the question. So we are focused upon, as I said, growing a business that is larger than it was in 2019. It's more diverse in terms of product offerings. It's growing faster than it was in 2019. It has more absolute EBITDA dollars and EPS dollars. That's our focus. We've given you obviously some color where things go in 2022. We expect that we can expand our volume beyond 2022. And we expect that once we are kind of to normal in that final state, we'll have industry-leading EBITDA margins. But beyond that, we don't want to get too specific about exactly what they're going to be other than our goal is to give more EBITDA dollars, more EPS dollars that are growing faster than they were pre-COVID. I think, Glenn, you did a great summary of the interconnectivity between those two and the new areas. A lot on timing. Nothing major in terms of market impact in 2022. We're still in building mode for some of those value-added products that you mentioned. And market entry where you might see any impact will be more into the 2023-2024 time frame. And Glenn, I'd just add to that as well that when we kind of look at our customer base and not too surprisingly, our top customers, the ones who can spend the most with us, uses most often are more likely to use multiple things, more likely to use the app and a much more likely to interest directly. So that's the model that we're trying to build upon to build the loyalty that Glenn mentioned. And we do have good evidence that, that is a trend that we can build on. And the more we build value, complete travel offering, frequency, direct linkage via the app, the more loyal those customers become. So let me take that. So first of all, let's put this into context. We -- this is to do with Booking.com. So Booking.com, we've been working with external service providers for a long period of time. And you may or may not know that when we get to our peak periods, the majority of our customer contacts actually handled by our XL partners. So for example, typically, last summer, we had about 75% of the CS contacts were handled by EXLP. So this is not something new. It's just something have a little bit more accelerated. Financial impacts, do not expect much in 2022. We're still working through, as Glenn said, through approvals and the close process, then there will be a transition period. Going forward, 2023 and 2024, this is more about potentially having the ability to have -- let the cost increase than in the past but the cost driver is not really the driver for doing this. It's really about ability. We have incredible variability in our workload from peak periods to low periods. And to run an in-house CS team is quite inefficient and also isn't the best employee experience for our workers because -- so they are experiencing peaks and troughs and the Korea development is also restricted because it's a very in-house group. So the bigger factor is really our flexibility, giving a bigger pool of opportunity for our employees and then with that comes some cost -- potential cost benefits in the form of lower increases as we ramp up the volumes. Sure, Mark. Let me take both of those. So yes, the 9% constant currency ADR growth was actually adjusted for basically geo mix, right, so same country. And that is a strong number. We experienced 9% ADR growth last year, again, versus 2019. So it's quite possible ADR is going to be at or higher than they were in 2021. I mentioned what the factors were. I mentioned the fact it was higher than our expectations. Do you think that the rates would start to tail off a little bit when we got into the -- got the high season where obviously, there was more supply relative to demand but the rates continue to hold up. And as I mentioned, flexible rates are still at a premium. But just underneath that, there was basically just higher prices, particularly in the left-oriented, high-demand areas remain strong. So we think that ADR is likely to be as high in '22 as we were in '21 compared to 2019. And then in terms of faster growth, I mean there are a number of factors there. We do believe that it can take together. We believe that there's further growth for us in the accommodation business, both on a geographic point of view, expanding our offering into alternative accommodations and adding on to that all the benefits from the connected trip, what we can do on top of that because of payments because of the fact we offer a more complete offering, thinking about more targeted ways to customize a complete solution for our customers, our pricing, payments, customer service. We think that we are solving today a relatively small part of the total travel equation and the potential for us to solve more of that is what's going to drive more growth, basically create a better product, a better service, have customers coming to us more frequently, increasing loyalty. They all work together to provide what we think is a great growth opportunity for us."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. Despite the appearance of the Omicron variant in late November and its rapid spread throughout Europe, the U.S. and other parts of the world, we closed out 2021 by delivering fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion and $940 million, respectively which were better than we expected. Room nights decelerated from down 10% in October compared to 2019 to down 35% in December. However, I am pleased to say that since December, we have seen a meaningful improvement in top line trends, with room nights in the first half of February reaching 2019 levels and with gross bookings higher than 2019. At Booking.com, I'm encouraged to see strong gross bookings on our books for the summer period in Western Europe and North America, both of which are now ahead of where we were at this time in 2019. Although I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable. 2021 was a year in which our hopes for a return to normalcy were set back several times, first with the Delta variant and then Omicron. However, we witnessed proof that people have a deep desire to travel. When leisure travelers believe it is safe to travel and restrictions are lifted, people book travel and we are currently seeing this starting to happen in many parts of the world. While this is a potentially favorable backdrop for 2022, we do expect there will still be periods when COVID negatively impacts travel trends as we move through the current year. David will provide additional details on our fourth quarter results and what we are seeing so far in the first quarter in his remarks. As I look back over the last year, I am proud of the work we have done under still difficult times to strengthen our core accommodation business by driving benefits to our traveler customers and to our supplier partners. For our customers, we remain focused on addressing our customers' critical needs of value, choice and convenience. One of the many ways we provide value for our customers and partners on Booking.com is through our Genius loyalty program. For our customers, our Genius loyalty program offers lower prices and other benefits like complimentary breakfast, room upgrades and discounted airport taxis. For our partners, our Genius program delivers incremental room nights to properties from our most loyal customers. Over the last year, we have meaningfully expanded our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com by opening the lowest level of Genius benefits to any customer who creates an account and is logged in on Booking.com. At the beginning of 2022, we fully launched a third tier of Genius for our top customers that made at least 15 bookings in the last two years. These Genius Level 3 members have access to even lower prices and priority customer service support in addition to all the benefits available to Genius Levels 1 and 2. These improvements to our Genius program are indicative of our efforts to move beyond just the transaction and increase our focus on value for the customer. With a higher degree of customer focus, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend and our direct relationships with our customers over time. Over the last year, we have enhanced Booking.com's mobile app, making it more user-friendly and easier to use. As I said before, the app is a critical platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. It is also where an increasing number of bookings are happening and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience. In 2021, Booking.com was the number one downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. For 2022, we are increasing our efforts to enhance the app in order to build on the success we saw over the last year. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we saw a consistently higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in 2019 and our direct mix improved even as we leaned into performance marketing channels during the year. We will continue to lean into performance marketing channels at appropriate ROIs as we look to bring more customer demand to our platform during the recovery. In addition to performance marketing, we will be utilizing brand marketing, particularly in markets where we are looking to raise consumer awareness of our customer-facing brands. A timely example of that which I hope all of you saw two weeks ago or so, was Booking.com's first Super Bowl ad in which we reintroduced the Booking slogan to our U.S. audience. We had a great year in the U.S. in 2021 with strong growth in room night and very strong growth in gross bookings versus 2019, even though Booking.com was relatively quiet from a brand marketing perspective. We are looking to accelerate the momentum of last year's performance by layering in brand marketing that extends beyond the Super Bowl ad through the rest of the year in order to introduce Booking.com to an even broader audience. As I mentioned last quarter, we have an ambition to acquire more customers in the medium intent space. We continue to work on strengthening our foundations for digital marketing, including in social channels. However, our spend so far remains relatively small. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform which means focusing on bringing incremental demand to properties from the broad audience of potential customers on our platform. For alternative accommodations, our global mix of room nights in 2021 of about 29% was in line with 2019 levels. In Europe, where our alternative accommodation offering is more competitive, our mix of room nights increased in 2021 by a few percentage points relative to 2019. We continue to work on improving the competitiveness of our alternative accommodation offering in the U.S. market, where we have added targeted supply over the last year and have plans for more additions and improvements to come in 2022. We closed out the year with 2.4 million hotel and alternative accommodation properties and over 28 million total reported listings on Booking.com, both of which were stable relative to the prior year. Let me now talk about the progress we have made over the last year in some of our key strategic priorities around payments and the connected trip. These strategic priorities are interrelated and we believe both will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth. On payments at Booking.com, we saw a further increase in adoption by our property partners in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, now with over half of U.S. gross bookings booked at properties that have adopted payments. Globally, about 60% of gross bookings are booked at properties that have adopted payments. About 30% of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q4 were processed through our payment platform which brings the full year 2021 mix to about 27% compared to about 22% for the full year 2020 and about 15% in 2019. We will continue our work on positioning Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment intermediary by providing payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, we see Booking.com's payment platform as a key component of our larger connected trip vision. On our connected trip vision, we made progress in 2021 as we work to build a robust flight platform on Booking.com. This flight platform gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these flight bookers. Flights also enables us to provide a more complete travel offering to our accommodation of customers. Booking.com's flight platform is now live in 34 countries which collectively represented about 70% of Booking.com's room nights booked in 2019. We continue to see that over 25% of Bookings flight bookers are entirely new customers to the platform. And of those new customers, an encouraging percentage are attaching an accommodation to their flight booking. These are positive early signals which help demonstrate that our flight offering can drive incremental new customers to us and we can cross-sell our accommodations product to them. We will continue our work to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity and build on the early positive signals we are seeing in flights. In November, we announced our intention to acquire Etraveli for \u20ac1.6 billion and we expect to close the transaction later this year pending regulatory approvals. Etraveli is one of the largest flight-centric online travel agencies and is a leader in flight booking technology. They've developed a comprehensive technology platform sourcing complex flight content from a variety of supply providers which is then distributed to consumer-facing sites. Booking.com and Etraveli have been successfully partnering over the last two years with Etraveli powering Bookings flight product. Given the strategic importance of flights to our connected trip offering, we believe it is critical to bring Etraveli flight expertise and technology in-house while also unlocking some of the limitations that exist in our current commercial agreement. When the deal closes, Etraveli will continue to operate as an independent company within Booking Holdings while further supporting the development of booking.com's flight platform. Outside of flights, Booking.com has significantly improved the coverage of its attractions product over the last year, in part due to the successful integration of third-party supply from Viator and Musement. We now have bookable attractions available in cities that represent about half of Booking.com's accommodation transactions which is up from about 10% coverage a year ago. While the volume of attractions bookings is still modest, we believe that developing a compelling, easy-to-use attractions product will help keep travelers engaged with our platform through the trip and build loyalty. We had a very busy end to 2021 and start to 2022, so I'd like to address a few other important recent updates. First, I am very excited to welcome the Getaroom team to Booking Holdings. We closed our $1.2 billion acquisition of Getaroom at the end of December and we are well underway with integrating Getaroom into Priceline, where it will help expand Priceline's current strategic partnerships business. Getaroom is a B2B-focused distributor of hotel rooms, primarily servicing leisure demand through about 150 affiliate partners primarily in the North American market. The B2B business is an important component and channel in our expansion efforts to reach new customers and partners, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. We believe B2B business can generate attractive returns by providing inventory to affiliate partners without the B2B business needing to invest significant dollars in brand marketing or online performance channels to generate customer demand. I am confident that the combined strategic partnership business of Priceline and Getaroom will improve B2B distribution for hotel partners while offering a robust accommodations technology stack for affiliate partners to help further enhance our offerings in North America. Second, some of you may have seen the news two weeks ago that Booking.com plans to enter into an expanded strategic partnership with Majorelle, one of our most trusted long-term external customer support partners. As part of this partnership which is still subject to consultation with works councils and regulatory approvals, Majorelle will begin employing most of the customer service representatives that previously worked for Booking.com outside The Netherlands and the U.K. We have been successfully working with Majorelle for six years in order to help meet the evolving seasonal demands of our business and we believe that this expanded partnership will help increase the flexibility and efficiency of our customer service offering going forward. Finally, on our last earnings call in early November, I discussed the urgency of tackling the global climate crisis and the importance of our industry coming together to work towards the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Shortly after that earnings call, Booking.com launched its Travel Sustainable Program. This is a first-of-its-kind program that features a travel-sustainable badge for any property on our platform that has implemented a combination of sustainable practices. When searching for accommodations, travelers can see whether or not a property has been given a travel-sustainable badge and can filter search results based on the badge. We believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through enabling our accommodation partners to showcase their sustainable practices to travelers who are looking for ways to travel more sustainably. We are looking forward to talking more about this program and other efforts and commitments related to sustainability when we publish our 2021 sustainability report and our first climate action plan in March. In conclusion, we executed well and produced strong results in 2021. As we look ahead to 2022, I am encouraged by the quick rebound in bookings we have seen so far this year and the level of summer travel on our books. While we expect to see some volatility in trends as a result of the ongoing effects of COVID, I am confident in the continued recovery in travel demand globally as there is clearly a very strong desire to travel among our leisure bookers. Of course, we are concerned and are monitoring the situation in Eastern Europe which we recognize could be disruptive to travelers who may be going to that region. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue capturing travel demand and we'll continue our work executing against our strategic priorities. As I have said before, we are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. And we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business with more products that generate some more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David? Why don't I let David handle the margin. Though he did -- he just said it in his prepared remarks. I'll let him say it again. Well, they're really two different acquisitions, Justin. Why don't I take them separately. So the Getaroom one, as I described in my prepared remarks, is very much adding to what we already have at Priceline in a B2B business that helps bring in customers that we wouldn't have gotten through our other marketing programs, whether it be pay-for-performance or brand. These customers are coming from affiliates. And there are contracts that Getaroom had and different technologies they have that by bringing them in is going to get us additional business that we wouldn't have gotten otherwise. On Etraveli, that was a different situation where, as I pointed out many times, how important it is for us to have this connected trip vision fulfilled. And one of the critical parts of it is our flight business. And we absolutely are very pleased to see not only the growth in our number of flight bookings but also the fact the number of new customers getting coming and the number who are then buying an accommodation. Now Etraveli has been powering the Booking.com product for two years. Great technology. They do a lot of things that could we recreate on our own? Probably it would take a long time, would require us to use resources that we want to use elsewhere. So by acquiring Etraveli, we're going to bring that technology in-house and be able to do things that we couldn't do when we were just a commercial partner. So I'm looking very forward to having that close and hopefully, as we said, in the future and then really began to develop a great, great combination. Sure, Lloyd. Two separate questions. Let me talk a little bit about the payments product and what we're developing and how it's going and I'll let David add a little more to it. I'm sure he want to add some more specifics. Clearly, we've talked about this in the past that one of the critical things is enabling a customer to be able to pay in the way they want to pay and enabling the supplier to get paid in the way they want to get paid. So right way, getting that out in the market enables us to have more business. Then you go beyond that and you see do it cheaper for our suppliers, do it in a way is cheaper than they're doing it right now the way they're doing their payments the way they're getting it through our old agency model Booking.com and finding a way that we can do that in a way that not only improves their business because they'll not to pay as much but obviously, we'll make a little out of that, too. But then it goes much more beyond and that is the connected trip. The connected trip doesn't work if you don't have payments because we need to put it all together in one payment that we can then handle on our own. And particularly, if there's anything goes wrong, we don't have to undo it, too. That's really going to be helpful to us. And then it's not just payments but it's our fintech unit which is the payments people but doing more things; it's coming in and helping out in flexible-type products. People want a flexible product. They can cancel us. Creating that on our own is something we'll be doing more so in the future. There are a number of different things we can do that will absolutely increase both the ease of use, the convenience and enable us to make more money out of it. And I'll pause there and let David, if he wants to add anything more to that. Then to the second thing, Lloyd, in terms of the connected trip, step one is build out the verticals. We didn't have flights a couple of years ago on Booking.com at all. And as you can tell by the numbers I put out, we still don't have 100% coverage for all the areas that we do accommodations. Have to build that out. Also just some of the technologies at Etraveli, we have a lot of things we can do to just improve that product. I talked a little bit about the attractions product where we had only 10% coverage last year. Now we made a lot of good progress to 50%. We had to put that all out. And then there are other areas, ground transportation, other parts of the trip. So we're building out all the verticals first to make sure we have the supply, make sure it works well, et cetera. At the same time, we are beginning, as I pointed out, about the people who get flights and then buy in a combination, we are doing some of that cross-selling and bringing that out. We'll do more and more. The goal, of course, is to make it so that it is so seamless, so frictionless that people when they're using Booking.com or any kind of trials we're doing, they're finding easier and offering more value. And that value comes from suppliers being willing to chime in to our platform and be able to offer different things that we can then very, very scientifically target at different customers in a way that gets an incremental customer to that supplier. The customer is happy, the supplier is happy and we, of course, make money. That will develop the loyalty, that will develop the direct business and that's where we're going for. And it's the same way in other parts of e-commerce where people don't shop around, they don't look around. They go to one player because they know that's the place where they're going to get the most value easiest to you, et cetera. And that's what we're going for. It's going to take some time but I love the progress that we're making. Kevin, so I think it's very difficult for anybody to have a perfect crystal ball into exactly what is driving the good numbers that David talked about for the first half of February. However, I think we can all feel fairly certain that there's a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for travel. For several years, people have not been able to travel the way they wanted to travel. Savings are up so people have cash. And I hear it anecdotally. I hear it when I talk to CEOs in the industry, what they're seeing, what they're hearing. I think everybody feels that people want to travel. And I don't think I would just see this as just a little bit of an Omicron rebound is what we're seeing. I think what we're seeing is people being able to travel, restrictions are going down, people are feeling safer. There are some new things coming out that will reduce the frictions in -- further in Europe. There's an announcement by the EU counsel about wanting to suggest getting rid of some of the restrictions. Those things all help people feel better about travel. And of course, though, there are parts of the world that are still having problems. And eventually, those are going to go down, too. So I feel good about the demand. I feel good about the future of travel. That being said, David made -- mentioned it several times, there are a lot of uncertainty still about how linear this is going to be. And I think we have to all look back at the past one. Many times, we thought things were out of the woods and then we weren't out of the woods. And of course, David also mentioned and I mentioned there are some macro events happening in different parts of the world that can also impact travel. So I think we all have to be cautious but optimistic. Here's the thing I absolutely do know, though, the long run. I know in the long run, we're going to do well in travel. People are going to come back. You can't stop that demand in the human being that wants to travel. How fast? We can't be certain but I am confident in our future. No, it's not completely done. The different countries -- you had different counties and I look at the list all the time. Some places are letting them up completely. U.K., you're probably aware; other places, still some. And the question is, do you need to take a test before you show up or not? If you're vaccinated but you're not vaccinated with an EU-approved vaccination here with the WHO vaccination approval, what's the difference there, all these things. But I think a lot of this stuff is going to be going away. And I hope, I hope in other parts of the world also, that these restrictions around the world can go down as quickly as possible. Australia, for example, was letting tourists back in and you maybe you saw some of those happy, happy photographs. Look, the fact is that I do not believe and I've seen a lot of data on this, that the restrictions on travel and this comes from the WHO and other authoritative sources, that travel restrictions do not have a significant impact on reducing the amount of infections in countries. And therefore, given the social costs, financial costs, et cetera, a lot of these restrictions should be lifted. So Doug, I heard the second part a little bit about the brand marketing but I didn't hear the first part. Let me answer the brand and our general marketing approach in the U.S. going forward and then maybe give me -- say again the beginning part there. Clearly, you saw that we didn't do a lot of brand marketing at the worst of the pandemic. And obviously, there's no reason to spend that money. And now with the recovery coming, we're coming back. And I'm very pleased with what we saw with our sub add-on. It's very, very early but I'm pleased with the numbers and what I've seen so far. And so we are stepping back into a more normal marketing approach as we did in 2019. That being said, we're always going to do what we've already done which is, look, where do we think we're going to get the best return for our marketing dollars. And we continue to evaluate what's going to give us the greatest return. But one thing that we have been changing over time and that is not looking just for the immediate transaction seeing what are we doing in terms of building out the long term, the loyalty, the repeat business, the coming back direct and being able to measure where that person came from and what they do after that. So we're a little more scientific in it than perhaps we were in the past for the long run but I'm pleased with that because I think that's what we need to do to really build the franchise and increase the value of the company. The first part -- what's the first part, Doug, you asked about? Sure. David, still there? And I would just add one other thing is we still believe absolutely the importance of great customer service. This has nothing to do with changing that. We're still going to be doing the technology that goes into the customer service process, our policies, all those things we're doing that. Also, it's looking to the future but we hope to build a very big company. The idea of then having to build a very big internal customer service operation is just not the best use of our resources, our managerial capabilities. This is something that is better done by people who are experts in that and can really do it better than we can do it but we can still provide all the great things in the actual customer service to the customer. It's definitely a win-win. Thank you. We are very pleased with 2021. It was a volatile and difficult year but it showed progress. And as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you and good night."

Please go ahead, sir.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings ' Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to be reporting strong results today for our peak travel season. Compared with 2019, Q3 room nights were down 18% which was an improvement from the 22% decline we previously reported for the month of July, and the 26% decline in Q2. The improvement since July was primarily driven by stronger room night trends in Europe. In the United States, room night growth in Q3 was strong, but lower than Q2.  Asia room night declines in Q3, were about an online with Q2 and remain down significantly versus 2019. International travel, which is important to our business, drove the overall sequential improvement in room night trends from Q2 to Q3. Nevertheless, our international room nights remain significantly depressed versus 2019. Q3 consolidated revenue of $4.7 billion, was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2.  The third quarter was also our most profitable quarter since Q3, 2019, with $2.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a 45% adjusted EBITDA margin. Moving into the fourth quarter, we have seen a further improvement in our room night trends in October, including early signs of a pickup in room night trends in Asia. Now, well, recently rising COVID case counts in many countries, including several important European countries, adds to the uncertainty around how November and December trends will progress.  David will provide additional details on our third quarter results in what we are seeing so far in the fourth quarter, in his remarks. The improvement in trends we saw in the third quarter. And so far in the fourth quarter following the negative impact for the Delta variant in July and August, once again, demonstrates the resilience of leisure travelers, who are looking to travel, when it is safe to do so, and restrictions are lifted. We are confident that we are on the path to the eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally.  As the global recovery continues, we are making progress, strengthening our core accommodation businesses support its long-term growth. As I said before, the strength of our core business comes from driving benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike. For our customers, we are aiming to create a superior booking experience and build stronger relationships, which we believe is accomplished by addressing our customers critical needs of value, choice, and ease-of-use.  We continue to see Booking.com's pre-pandemic customers coming back and booking with us, while we're also attracting new customers. Importantly, we see our top customers from before the pandemic were turning to us at a meaningfully higher frequency than other customers. Providing attractive prices on accommodations is a key component of offerings value for our customers.  We work closely with our supply partners to increase participation in our targeted rate programs to ensure that compelling prices are available to our customers. Our Genius loyalty program at booking.com is a great example of a program where hundreds of thousands of our property partners are participating to offer lower rates and other benefits such as complementary practice, room upgrades, and discounted airport taxi to our large customer base.  In addition to offering lower rates on accommodations, we have recently extended lower rates on rental cars to our Genius customers. This is just 1 example of the way we continue to innovate and add value for our Genius members. With about 2/3 of our room nights booked on mobile devices, and the majority of those booked through the app, it's critical that we provide our customers with a positive booking experience on our app.  The app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and ultimately, we see it as the center of our Connected Trip experience. In the third quarter, booking.com was once again the number one downloaded OTT app globally, according to a third-party research firm. Also, in the third quarter, we surpassed 100 million monthly active app users for the first time. The recent growth of Booking.com's app is encouraging, and we are working hard to continue to build on this success. In the third quarter, we saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the third quarter of 2019.  A direct mix improved even as we leaned into performance marketing channels during our peak travel season. While we will continue to invest in performance marketing, we will also look to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels, as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increase consumer awareness of our brands. For example, with our ambition to acquire more customers in the medium intense space, we've made progress in strengthening our foundations for digital marketing, including social channels.  Though us spend so far has been small. However, we're increasingly confident in the potential for these channels. And as we see positive results, we expect to raise our level of participation there. Remaining active in investing effectively across marketing channels, is made even more important by the opportunity to acquire focus for new to online booking channels. Travel, like many industries during pandemic, has seen a meaningful shift from offline to online according to third-party data.  And this has increased our addressable market. For our support partners, we are focused on bringing incremental demand to their properties from a broad audience of potential customers on our platform. In a certainty of 600 small and medium hoteliers in Europe conducted earlier this year, 85% percent of respondents agreed that online platforms are a cost-efficient way to increase the reach to their hotel and source more diverse, yes. We agree with this statement and believe it applies more broadly.  Whether we are working with a small and medium hotel in Europe, or an alternative accommodation, or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform. With our chain hotel partners, we are continuing to see increased engagement relative to 2019 levels, which shows up in higher levels of participation in our programs that enable them to differentiate and promote themselves on our platform. For our alternative accommodations, the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3, 2019.  This increase in [Indiscernible] recombination share of our business in the quarter was less than it was in Q2 as we saw a greater sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3. Our property counts of about 2.4 million and reported listings of over 28 million on booking.com remains stable relative to the prior quarter. Let me talk more about some of our key strategic priorities. Payments, and the Connected Trip, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business, and support its continued growth.  Turning to payments of Booking.com. Last quarter, we spoke about the organization of all of our payments, initiatives and efforts within a new Fintech unit at booking.com The recently established Fintech nearly enables booking.com to have a dedicated focus on enhancing payments in our core business to both customers and partners, as well as monetizing our overall transaction flows, be a new payments, related products, and services. Adoption of our payment solutions by our supply partners in both the U.S. and Europe continues to grow. Adoption in the U.S. has seen significant increases recently, driven by the additions of some major hotel chains in the second and third quarters, which we will look to build on in the fourth quarter.  In Europe, more customers are choosing to pay using booking.com 's payment platform when finalizing their booking as an attractive and localized options are provided. This will result in nearly a third of booking.com 's total gross bookings in Q3 being processed through our payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full-year 2020. The Fintech unit is also driving continued payments innovation to ensure that growth is sustained into the future.  This includes offering a low-cost payout choice to our suppliers, as well as partnering with third-parties to provide payment solutions to our buckets, such as, buy now pay later. We believe these efforts help position booking.com as near transit and trusted payment intermediary for all parties on our platform. On our Connected Trip vision, we've been focused this year on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their attributing one place on Booking.com.  We continue to work on scaling up our robust flight platform on booking.com which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel generally, and allow us an opportunity to across LOR accommodation and other services to these bookers. Booking.com's for the product is now live in 27 countries. Total Company air tickets in the third quarter was up 131% versus Q3 2019, primarily driven by strength in Priceline's, but also helped by Booking.com slight offering, which continues to meaningfully exceed our expectations. Wallet remains early days for Booking slight product.  We're seeing that over 25% of Booking's flight bookers, are entirely new customers. With these new customers, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of accommodation bookings. However, there is more work to be done to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity. The early signals helped demonstrate though, that our flight offering can drive incremental new customers to the platform to which we can cross-sell our combination product.  We are beginning to test initiatives targeting these new flight customers, including, for example, encouraging account creation to activate Genius status, and in some cases, offering additional incentives for them to book accommodations. We remain focused on continuing to test and innovate in order to build on the early successes, we're seeing with flight at Booking.com. We're also continuing to run test using offerings from our verticals like rental cars and taxis.  Before closing, I do want to note that as world leaders assemble this week in Glasgow for the cop26 Summit discussing the urgency of tackling the global climate crisis. I cannot overstate the importance for our industry to come together to work for the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. De - carbonization is a major challenge for the entire industry. Excelling this challenge requires the commitment of all stakeholders. I am proud to say that our Company, Booking Holdings, is committed to addressing this challenge.  We recently released a report that we commissioned with EY-Parthenon that looks into what will it take to get the accommodations industry specifically to a carbon-neutral future. While a big task, data shows it is achievable. At booking.com, we are working on making it easier for travelers to find and choose sustainable accommodation options with booking their travel. In addition, we're working with our accommodation supply partners by sharing guidance, insights, and best practices to enhance sustainability initiatives at the property level.  Of course, there is much more that must be done, but we believe that we are taking important steps to contribute to a more sustainable future for our industry. And finally, we plan on publishing a Booking Holdings, climate transition plan in early 2022, which we'll speak more about at that time. In conclusion, we executed well and produced strong results in our peak travel season, which is a credit to the hard work and support provided by the many teams across our Company. I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in many parts of the world.  And I'm confident that we are on the path to an eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally. We continue with our important work to strengthen our Company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. As I said before, we were thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand, and we are focused on building a larger and faster growing business that generates more earnings after the full recovery, and for the long run. And now turn the call over to our CFO, A - David Goulden, David [Indiscernible] David is dialing back in, I think.\nDavid Goulden: Yeah, I'm calling back in Glenn. Sorry, have you just finished?\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. I just finished.\nDavid Goulden: All right. Perfect timing, thank you. I was cut off and I'm back in again. Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our results for the third quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the fourth quarter. To avoid comparisons to the pandemic impacted periods in 2020, all growth rates are relative to comparable periods in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results, can be found in our earnings release. Now onto our results for the third quarter.  On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends that that we saw throughout the second quarter driven by the U.S. and Europe, followed by loss pullback in July. After our earnings call, we saw our overall trends improve in August and continue to get better in September, which resulted in Q3 reported remise declining 18% versus Q3 2019, which was ahead of the 26% decline in Q2 and the 22% decline in July.  September was the strongest month in the third quarter, we remise declining for 14%, about the same level as June. The improvements in the Q3 room night decline versus Q2 was driven primarily by Europe, which benefited from strong cross-border travel with a duration. In Q3, room night in Europe, were down mid-single-digits versus 2019 with room night trends improving in August versus July, September was similar to August.  You will recall the room night growth pulled back from June to July in Europe due to concerns over the Delta variance. Rest-of-world also improved from Q2 to Q3. In the U.S we --, Q2 to Q3. However, the U.S. still have strong growth in the quarter and remained our strongest performing major country in Q3. Within the U.S. we saw a meaningful slowdown in August from the very strong growth we experienced in July, followed by a recovery to strong growth in September. The slowdown in the U.S. in August with due to concerns about the Delta variance.  Asia room night declined in Q3, or about in line with Q2. Room nights in Asia was still down significantly from 2019 levels. Mobile bookings primarily through our apps, represented about 2/3 of our total room nights are. Our apps continue to represent an increasing percentage of our mobile bookings. In Q3, as Glenn mentioned, we achieved an important milestone in use of our app at Booking.com, surpassing 100 million monthly active users.  We are also pleased to see the number of unique customers booking via our app in the quarter, grow strongly compared with Q3 2019. Our direct channel as a percentage of our room nights, year-on-year, and relative to Q3 2019, increased. While international room nights remain down versus 2019, we saw no sequential improvements in our international trends, with international mix of our room nights increasing to about 33% in Q3 from about 25% in Q2, and about 15% in Q1. Most of this improvement in international room nights came from bookings for travel within Europe. We continued to see double-digit growth in domestic room nights in Q3, but at a slightly lower level than in Q2. The pickup in international travel in the quarter was a driver of the improvement in overall room night trends from Q2 to Q3. However, international room nights were down almost 50% compared with Q3 2019 levels. Our Q3 cancellation rate was slightly above Q3 2019 levels. However, cancellation rates improved in the quarter and September was slightly better than 2019 for the month. Percentage of our 2,000 -- of our Q3 2021 bookings, made with flexible cancellation policies, remains significantly higher than in Q3, 2019.  The booking window of Booking.com remains shorter than it was in the third quarter of 2019 and contracted more they did in Q2, as we saw a high mix of near-term bookings during our peak summer season. All regions had a shorter booking window in Q3 than in Q3, 2019. alternative accommodations that the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3, 2019. The increase mix alternative accommodations in the quarter was less than it was in Q2, as we saw, a great sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3.  I will turn into Cornish room nights in Europe grew slightly in August and September versus 2019 down for the quarter were about in line with Q3 2019. We believe we benefited from the strength of our portfolio Europe where we could respond to solid demand for alternative accommodations and an improving demand for hotels. Gross bookings declined 6% in Q3, which is less than the decline in room nights due to the increase in average day rates for accommodations of about 10% versus 2019 on a constant-currency basis.  And also due to a couple of points of benefit from changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flight business. Our accommodations constant currency ADR benefited by just over 5% points for an increased mix of business in North America, which is a high ADR region, and a decrease of mix in Asia, which is a low ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up just about 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in Europe and North America across many destination-types with notable strength in beach-oriented leisure destinations.  [Indiscernible] figures booked in the third quarter were up 131% versus 2019, driven by very strong growth of Priceline. [Indiscernible] flight bookings at Booking.com We're encouraged to see another quarter of triple-digit growth from a [Indiscernible], which are key components of our multi-product Connected Trip strategy. [Indiscernible] revenue for third quarter was 4.7 billion, which was 7% below Q3, 2019, and was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2, 2021, a far greater sequential improvement in 2019. Our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with Q3 2019, which was in line with our expectations.  We experienced even more revenue seasonality in Q3 2021 than normal due to the concentration stays in Q3 from bookings made in the quarter and also for bookings [Indiscernible] when customers could book accommodations, but could not stay due to restrictions and other COVID related concerns. The strong top-line performance for performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, which is 15% below Q3, 2019. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, decreased 3% versus Q3, 2019.  Marketing expense declined by few points less than gross bookings, due to slightly up low ROI in paid channels of the invested into capturing demand during the peak travel season. Sales to our expenses in Q3 were significantly higher than they were in Q2 on a dollar basis, due to higher volume of merchant gross bookings, which increased as a percentage of our total gross bookings in the third quarter. Our Booking.com announced a gross bookings process to our payment. Payment platform in Q3 was over $6 billion, which was almost 1/3 of Booking.com's business, up from about a quarter in Q2.  Our more fixed expense categories in Q3, in aggregate, came in 3% lower than Q2, after $136 million of personnel expense in the second quarter related to our decision to repay the government aid was mostly offset by an increase from Q2 to Q3 in our bonus accruals and digital service tax expense, both of which are crude proportional to revenue. Our non-GAAP EPS was $37.70, down 17% versus Q3 2019. non-GAAP net income of $1.6 billion reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%, which is higher than the 19% in Q3 2019 due to a high proportion of non-tax-deductible expenses in relation to lower pre -tax income versus 2019.  On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $2 billion in Q3. We recorded GAAP net income of $769 million in the quarter, which includes a $1 billion pre -tax realized loss on our equity investments primarily relates to our [Indiscernible], as well as income tax expense of a $199 million. Now onto our cash and liquidity position, our Q3 ending cash investments balance of $15.4 billion was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $16.1 billion at the $1.5 billion of free cash flow was more than offset by the repayments for $1 billion convertible note matured in Q3 and the $1 billion unrealized loss on our equity investments.  The return of capital to shareholders, has and will be an important component of our value creation strategy. Throughout the COVID pandemic, we said that we will start returning capital to shareholders when we saw that our 3 largest regions, we're no longer a meaningful risk of [Indiscernible] reversal due to COVID, and also become more predictable. Assuming that travel recovery continues, we plan to restart returning capital in early 2022 under our remaining authorization.  Assuming continued recovery, we'd expect to complete this organization within 3 years from restarting. Now onto our thoughts for the fourth quarter. Our total room nights declined 10% versus 2019, which is better than the 14% decline in September. The improvements in October were driven mainly by Asia. Although the region comes -- a lot of the region remains down from suitably visiting. 2019. The improvement in Asia was led by domestic travel with the many countries and was driven by an improving vaccination progress and governments easing restrictions on travel.  Room night growth in the U.S. improved little from September to October and remains strong in October. Rest of the world also improved little in October, and was back close to 2019 levels. We were declines in Europe were about the same in October as they were in September, but weaken towards the end of the month. This resulted in overall room night declines being higher in the last week of October than the average for the month.  The slowdown at the end of October in Europe was driven by a number of countries that have seen recent increases in COVID infections, including Germany, Russia, and Italy. Given the ongoing uncertainty around COVID, it's difficult to predict how room nights in November-December will compare with the 10% reduction we saw in October. Looking forward to November-December, the rising case counts across many important Western European countries and across much of Eastern Europe, as well as the start of the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, which in 2020 contributed to an increase in COVID cases, creates unpredictability.  Also, pre -pandemic contribution of Asia to total room nights was highest in November and December, and Asia is still our least recovered region. On a more positive note, since the U.S. announced in late September the plans to ease travel restrictions in November for international travelers who are vaccinated, we've seen a significant improvement in room nights booked by Europeans to travel to the U.S. as well as the reverse. Also, we're pleased to see more gross bookings on the books for the Christmas, New Year periods, that we saw at this time in 2019 in the U.S. and Western European. Change to the Income statement, we expect Q4 gross bookings to decline by a few points, less the room nights, driven by higher reported ADRs and flight bookings versus 2019. We expect less of an increase in our ADRs in Q4 than Q3 due to less of benefit from regional mix of the Asia region continues to recover, but also due to low occupancy rates after the peak travel season. We expect Q4 revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to a couple of factors.  The first, is due to short booking window in Q3. A low percentage of Q3 bookings [Indiscernible] normal will stay in Q4. The second, is due to our expectation that the booking window will contract less in Q4 than it did in Q3, resulting in more bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check-in in future quarters. As a result, we expect our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be more than 1% below Q4, 2019. This also means we expect Q4 revenue to have a greater sequential decrease from Q3, that we saw in 2019, and we expect Q4 revenue to decline more than it did in Q3.  We expect Q4 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings increased slightly versus 2019, as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect Q4 sales or expenses to be lower than they were in Q3 due to lower merchant transaction volumes. However, we expect sales or expenses in the fourth quarter to be higher than in Q4 2019 due to higher merchant, volumes, and mix.  We expect our more fixed expense categories in Q4 in aggregate to be about in line with Q3 on a dollar basis. We expect Q4 EBITDA to be positive but driven largely by the higher, the normal seasonal decrease in revenue, we expect a much greater seasonal sequential decrease in EBITDA from Q3 to Q4, the normal. In conclusion, we're pleased with our recovery and the top-line in Q3, which led to strong finance results for the quarter. The financial strength we saw in Q3 was [Indiscernible] by the concentration of stage in the quarter, which will lead to some differences in the comparison of Q4 to Q3 relative to what we've seen in prior years.  October room night trends improve relative to September, driven by some encouraging trends at Asia. However, recently, the rising case counts across Europe increases in certainty about how trends will progress in November and December. In closing with confidence in our ability to capture demand as the global recovery continues and execute against our strategic projects. With that, I will now take your questions and Eli, I'll turn over to you to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Reminder to our audio attendees [Operator Instructions] Please stand-by while we can open the Q&A line. The first question is from the line of Justin Post of the Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJustin Post : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Great to see Europe recovering. With room nights down 10% versus '19, Glenn, maybe you could go through what needs to happen from here to get above '19. What areas still need to come back strong and not just Asia, but your thoughts on that. And then David, maybe you could talk about core business margins versus '19. Let's ignore payments and take your trip for now. But how are you thinking of the puts and takes on the core business versus '19. Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Justin. I don't think it's a very hard answer really what we need. What we need is, obviously, more of a recovery against this pandemic, because that's clearly what's driving the problem than in many industries, ours particularly. For us, we've talked about this a few times. We talked about, our business has done well with international, and international generally has been hard hit, albeit we are seeing some better things. But that the long haul is still a problem. Yes, we're seeing some numbers coming up in Asia, great. I love it. The fact that people are getting more vaccinated in Asia, that's great. The fact that vaccines are being distributed more broadly and getting around, that's great.  The fact that the pharmaceutical Companies are coming out with new ways to combat against this terrible virus with pills now, that can help people who have caught it, end up being hopefully healthier quicker, all good things. But what we need really, is for everyone who can get a vaccine, to please go out and get that vaccine. If you're medically able to and you're capable getting it, please get. That will help hasten the recovery for not only the travel industry, but the entire world. And that's what we hope will happen.  Obviously, we're doing everything we can, so we're prepared when that day comes, which it will, we can't say when, but we know will come. And we're preparing by doing all the things that Dave and I have been talking about. Preparing with our partners, and getting our marketing prepared, and doing all the steps that you know we've been doing to make sure that when travel comes back to above 2019, we're getting the share we want to be getting. And David, you want to [Indiscernible] -- you're going to answer the second question and answer mine too.\nDavid Goulden: Yeah. So now, I [Indiscernible] as great, we\u2019d actually be [Indiscernible] relatively quick on the puts and takes in the core combination business. Our underlying take rates have been solid, and obviously, the reported take rates are a function of timing, so that continues to go well for us. As we get to -- back to 2019 levels, there will be some inflation refresher on the personnel line. Everybody knows there's a war for tech talents out there, and we've had two for years whether the merit increases in other expenses in -- other increases in our cost base.  Of course, we did take expenses out, but there are variable expenses. So, they will come back with some efficiency over time, but there will be some pressure on the personnel line. But there are other things that are in the model that we can use to offset that pressure. We can get extra economy to scale as the business growth is beyond 2019 levels on both the fixed costs and on the variable cost side as well. There are opportunities in our direct mix, which of course is very important. And of course, a key element.  And this will grow happens to off over ROIs. And on the front marketing side where we saw some increase in the first half of the year, we saw some small compression in the second-half of this year, but those markets are very variable and very dynamic, and we're pleased with how we're doing in those markets. The last thing I want to leave you with on that topic is that within our core business, there's always a trade-off between growth market share, and profitability.  So, to the extent we see opportunities, we leaning in. We want to try and drive market share increases where we think that we can, that will pressure the business in the short-term as we lean into making those investments. And also, as the investment in marketing and other areas were basically be a leading indicated relative to revenue. So, there will -- we do believe that we're -- there are opportunities for us to gain share in accommodations through this -- the recovery and beyond. So that would be an additional factor in the mix and how we think about the long-term business margin in accommodations.\nJustin Post : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks so much. Hoping to dig into ad spend trends a little bit. So, spend is going up a little. How much of that is Booking getting more aggressive as demand picks up versus a more competitive overall ad environment? And then compared to 2019 as distribution in brand and performance changed meaningfully. And lastly, can you give us an update on the kind of merchandising and promotion -- some of the merchandising promotion tests that you've done over the past couple of quarters? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: David, why don't you take the first 2, about the aired competitiveness, and I think some brand question? And I will talk a bit about some of the merchandising.\nDavid Goulden: Exactly. Thank you. Let us do that. So, Kevin, if you remember we -- on the last call, we said that we expect to see some reduction in our rise in Q3 versus 2019 and actually, our rise came out very much where we expected them to. Actually, our direct mix was slightly better than we expected in Q3. And that's why those less of a compression in the difference between gross bookings and marketing that we actually expected in Q3.  So that's positive. If it really -- something that we -- I say that was more what we did because we expect that to be the outcome. Of course, these markets are dynamic and as recovery continues, more, more play will come back into the marketplace. But basically, what happened in Q3 was very much in line with what we've told you a quarter ago would happen. The mix in between brands and the performance has not materially changed. If you recall, back in 2019, around 9% of all marketing spend was in imports, marketing.  We are looking to move up -- to move the brand spend up a little bit over time. But of course, brand has been very much shut down in 2020. It's not going back on in 2021. So, we're not in a very different position than where we were in 2019, but we do see the opportunity to continue to trend a little bit more towards brands, some of which might go on at the mid-funnel (ph.) market opportunities that Glenn talked about. And then Glenn, I'll turn -- hand over to you to talk about the 3rd one.\nGlenn Fogel: Yeah. So, Kevin, obviously, merchandising is a very important reason why we built out, and are continuing to build-out, our payments platform in booking.com. Just making sure that we're able to compete and provide great value to our customers. And what's really important is not doing just out of our own pocket, but working with our partners, coming up with the right time to the right consumer, the right offer and helping them.  Our supply partners, also provide some of that, let's say, added value. For example, we may do flash sales. You may hope or you've seen some. Hope you've gotten some, hope you actually booked some of them. That's an example. One of the things, for example, when somebody is getting in accommodation and we are able to offer them either lower cost or even free sometimes, right from the airport to the hotel. In a [Indiscernible], different variations that we can do with the different verticals in coming up with the best combination, trying to do as much as we can with our suppliers\u2019 money, but sometimes using our own too to come up what really is an attractive offer. So, the consumer knows that when it come to our site, they're getting the best value, because value really is one of the key strategic objectives for us, always through providing that.\nKevin Kopelman: Thanks Glenn. Thanks David. Really helpful.\nOperator: Your next question is from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Thanks. This is Zack on for Deepak. Thanks for taking the questions. First on pent-up demand. Obviously, it's been a nice tailwind for your business so far and general travel demand over the last few quarters. But just curious how you're thinking about whether there's another leg to run on the level of pent-up demand.  Asia is still depressed, as you noted, and across border restrictions are easing. So, as we look into next year, how are you guys thinking about the level of pent-up demand? And then second, when we dig a little further into the current trends, is there any reversal in terms of urban versus suburban or shorter versus longer-term [Indiscernible] you could call out? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Zach, so just to make sure I understood your first part of your question. You're just asking a little bit about how we're going to get the demand that's coming in the future, do I have that correct?\nDeepak Mathivanan: Just -- I guess like understanding whether the level of pent-up demand that you guys\u2019 kind of expecting as we move into next year given there's still current travel restrictions, especially on the cross-border side --\nGlenn Fogel: Right.\nDeepak Mathivanan: You just --\nGlenn Fogel: Okay.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Remain depressed.\nGlenn Fogel: Yeah.\nDeepak Mathivanan: So, as we look into next year, should we see another --\nGlenn Fogel: Right.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Kind of books.\nGlenn Fogel: I got it.\nGlenn Fogel: Okay. Why don't you about first half, but I'll let David say wherever we are -- what we feel, we can disclose regarding any of the trends regarding different parts of the business. So, we absolutely know there's huge pent-up demand by of course any time, any government, let's go restriction. We see immediate, immediate demand. So, for example, the announcement of the November 8th opening for people to come to the U.S. Immediately, we saw demand. In the U.K. when they changed restriction, immediate demand. So, we know it's there.  Absolutely. Now, how much have we don't have a way to quantify it, but we do note if you look at particularly in the U.S., when you look at what people savings rates are right now, you have been able to save a lot of money during this pandemic and they want to spend it. And one thing people have not been able to do as much they want to, is go travel.  So, I believe there is a significant amount of demand there, just waiting to come out. But of course, you'd have to -- we have to have these restrictions for the long-haul international travel open up. And we also -- we know that it's important that we always provide the best value so that when they do travel, they come to us and David what you can say about suburban and local far what you can say.\nDavid Goulden: Yeah, Zach (ph.). Q3 saw strong recovery across the geographies that we talked about. So, I'd say there's still a bias towards more leisure outdoor-oriented activity, particularly beach-oriented properties did very well in the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere.  But we do see some recovery into the cities as well, and I think this -- we all know that anecdotally, if you want to book a hotel room night in a city, it's becoming increasingly hard. So, we are seeing recovery across the board, although still more entry (ph.) towards the outdoor beach-oriented leisure locations.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Your next question is from Mark Mahaney on the Evercore ISI, your line is now open.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. Three quick ones, please. Any impact at all from IDFA. Secondly, those 100 million mobile app, MAUs, do you have enough history to know if those are actually materially different? Are they more or less profitable? They more or less loyal than, more or less likely to convert than the users that you had coming at you from other platforms.  And then third, please, the rolling out of the air products to more market. you have it in 21 markets, you rolled out some good statistics here about how 25% of the customers are new. And there was something you said about add-on sales. If you could just repeat what that was. But it all sounds like that's a really good product addition. So, I guess the action question is, why aren't you out -- how long will it take you to roll it out fully across our markets, given how positive it's been so far?\nGlenn Fogel: Thanks Mark. Why don't I take -- let me do the air question first, then I'll talk a little bit about IDFA, and I'll let David what he wants to say about our app and I'm not sure how -- I'll let him be streets if you wanted to be or not about what we see ensuring profitability, etc. You're absolutely right about the air business very exciting for us, of course, and we've been working on it. And it's interesting because I happen to have noticed that in the first quarter call in 2020, just as things started going very bad for the whole world.  We're talking about the -- just starting out the air business at Booking.com in the fourth quarter of 2019. And I mentioned about we're striving to get to that 50% coverage of Booking.com customers. I was looking forward to hopefully doing that for 2020. And of course, that didn't quite happen exactly we wanted, but the question and it wasn't from you, Mark, who is another analyst to ask that why not a 100%. And I said, well, the 15% was just don't want to get to that year. [Indiscernible] of course, we want to get to a 100% and that still is the same thing. Yes, we're 27 countries, of course, we want to get to every single country, to anybody we currently deal with.  We want to be able to provide them with an air ticket, but it takes time. It's not something you just flip a switch. You have to actually go to regulation is to get licensing and all sorts of things. So, we're enrolling out as we can, as we should, and we will get to a 100% at some point, I do want to point out though we are at that over that 50% number right now. So, I am pleased to where we are with that. I also want to say though it's still so early, we're not doing big marketing yet, real big marketing. There are a lot of opportunities to get a much higher number of people come into this air product.  And the reason that we like it, is not only the 25% new customers, of course fantastic, but it\u2019s that attachment rate, which I haven't given a number. But I'm pleased with where we are with that right now. And again, that's something we have not optimized yet. There's a lot of opportunity there to optimize that and get an even higher attachment rate. And that's part of the overall vision of being able to bring new customers in from different verticals, different ways than we've done in the past, which is primarily pay for performance marketing and delivering a lot more customer. And as we talked a little bit earlier in a previous answer about being able to provide them with a lot more value.  Your first question about IDFA, but these privacy related changes, they only impact a small part of our marketing, and it's obviously not unique to our Company. We know that very confident, we can manage through this. And as we know -- as you know, most of our marketing primarily paid marketing channels like PPC and [Indiscernible] and that's not going to be directly impacted by any of these kinds of changes. Our focus has always first-party data. We want to leverage the data into marketing, any of these changes to privacy, like the IDFA -- thing is this does not really impact us.  And I think you would know, we chose not to show us the app -- track and opt-in back in April 20 -- April 21 this year, April, while the IDFA specifically decided not to do that. And of course, you've seen our results since then, so I really don't think this is a big deal for us. Very proud of the team in our whole marketing. They will be able to work and come up with, I would say, privacy-oriented ways to continue to be able to market with good tracking and ROIs. And David, I think you had number 2, which is about the monthly active users through mobile.\nDavid Goulden: Yeah, I got number 2. And Mark, what I can tell you is we kind of watch very carefully how different types of direct user response. And obviously, the more direct we can get, the better. And the more those direct customers returned and there are three types of direct customers. The direct customers using the app, the direct customers that come to us on the mobile web, the direct customers who comes to us on desktop.  And perhaps not too surprisingly, the direct customers on the app measured by the [Indiscernible] you just talked about, are most [Indiscernible] of their customers. It's a good thing. We will get more of that. And a lot of our marketing that we do these days [Indiscernible] oriented. I'd getting people to download and use the app because it's sticky.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David.\nOperator: Next, we have Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. Want to come back to the comments you talked about a little bit earlier around the dynamics around hotel room night growth with traditional hotel supply room night growth versus alternative accommodations.  Curious what your view is on how the landscape on both the supply and the demand side might evolve as we move into a post-pandemic world and aim towards summer of 2022, and how you think about making investments on supply to match up the way in which there might be a more normalized travel environment in '22. Thanks so much.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. I'll give my first comments and I'll let -- David can always add if he'd like. So, we saw before the pandemic an increase in the alternative accommodations business as they became a larger and larger share of the total combinations business. And we're just going on a pretty steady rate going up. And pandemic happens and you get a step change. As people desire safety, being away from crowds and they go there. And now we've seen for ourselves, we've seen people liking hotels in that. I think the long-term trend that will continue.  And I think if you look five years in the future, I think alternative combinations will be a higher share. That means of course for us. We talked about this in the past how important is that we go out, make sure we get the best supply we can get. And that means working hard on that and making sure that the people own these properties, see us as a platform that they want to use, and it's first in their mind that this is a great way to fill up their properties, and that's something that we are working on absolutely.  The demand side similar. Go to Europe, and we've talked about in the past, and says, where can I get a villa? In the south of France, people will say, I think booking.com 's a great place. You went to the U.S. and we said, hey, I need a vacation place to ski. They may not think of booking.com first. We got to get that awareness up and I've talked about that in the past and that's what we have to do also. But one of the truly great things about booking.com is we offer more of both. Nobody offers -- you put together hotels and alternative accommodations, you put that together, were the ones that have both of those.  And I really believe that's a superior way for somebody to decide what they're going to choose in terms of accommodation. And we see this in our data. We see people come, they look -- first, start looking at one type and then they end up booking another type. And they're able to compare and contrast both. They'll see the reviews on both. Look at the prices on both. What are they going to get from one, what are they going to get from the other? That's why we believe we have a superior offering to the consumer.  And I do believe though that is something that absolutely, it's going to continue. But on the other side, you all see the hotels they're making some moves themselves. And they're coming up with ways to offer a better wall frame, providing some of the benefits of an alternative accommodation. Two of this silver, particularly so they are prepared as people work in a new way in the future and want to have both the benefits of the hotel but perhaps more room or more services that you can get in terms of making sure you have good WiFi or a place you can do your work at. And that's some nice, see also hotels are definitely be getting to that space. David, I don't know if you want to say anything more to that.\nDavid Goulden: That was good. I just point out that to your point, that does strengthen that balance in both clearly contributed to us having a strong Q3 because we saw strong demand in [Indiscernible] to continue that we saw sequentially, a much bigger increase from Q2 to Q3 in hotels that we could off the book.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for the color.\nOperator: Next, we have Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nStephen Ju: Okay. Thank you so much. Glenn, I think in the past we've talked about your payment\u2019s product helping to expand your term by their on-boarding those users who may not necessarily be using credit cards and instead online payment services. Given the overall, I guess, depressed state of travel in Asia, maybe much of that value of lock is still in front of us, but are you seeing evidence in other regions of the world that this is helping to bring in that incremental user? And also, just the rising ability for you guys to merchandise as you do more the Connected Trip, but -- opens up a greater opportunity for you guys to run promos and change prices, enhance -- flex your gross margins up and down to drive growth on top of what has always been a more of a performance marketing-driven growth. So, is there still a pretty material gap in ROI from doing one versus the other at this point in terms of what you perceive?\nGlenn Fogel: So, I'll talk about the first one about our payments. I'll let David talk about ROIs on our merchandising approach and how we're doing that. So, you're absolutely right. If somebody doesn't have the ability to pay for something because they don't have the appropriate payment method then they're not going to be able to buy from that person or in that Company like us. So, we always have to do that. So, if you are in Southeast Asia and let's say somebody is using most of the Grab, who is a partner of ours and they're using GrabPay.  Well, we're not able to use GrabPay for the hotel, taking the money in from the consumer, that person is not going to use us, they're going to use somebody else. We have obviously GrabPay our partner working on that. Or if you look at other ways, people who say they go and look, it's not their favorite, they could use it another way, they still decided not to use us. There's something else we've seen which is really interesting, is that just having more ways to accept payments seems to increase conversion sometimes.  I don't know why, I can give you a science, I just see data. This is a lot interesting. The other side is making sure we're paying the supplier the way they want to get the money. Because sometimes they say, you know I don't want to get it the way you're doing it with virtual credit card or I don't want to get it in terms of a bank transfer, I want to get it some other way. So, we've got to be able to do that, and that improves our relationship with the suppliers. If it particularly approves with the supplier when the method that we can get the money to them is cheaper than the method they are currently using.  That's a great thing when we can do that, that's another value add to that hotel or any other types of suppliers, lots of ways that we're going to do that and there are all other things we're working at, the ThinTec part of our business that we're just starting out. We talked last time about saving up that unit. There are a lot of opportunities there and we talked about how in 2019 we did over a $100 billion with a gross booking. And our idea is to -- let's find ways that we can monetize that better. And let's find ways we can provide value to both consumers and suppliers. And David, I don't know if you want to add a little ROIs and how we're doing merchandise.\nDavid Goulden: Sure, as Glenn said, payments is increasingly becoming heart of the core value proposition that we offer at booking.com in particular to both customers and partners. It's no longer just kind of we think as add-on, it really is solving problems for both all of them in cost-effective ways and risk reduction ways, they couldn't do as efficiently themselves. So as much as ROI is growing so rapidly, changing all that mix. Now, you're right, Steve. Once we're on payments, we can participate in merchandising.  Of course, with the most efficient way to get rates, is to source great rates, which Glenn talked about, frame out additional lines. But if we need to participate over and above sourcing and driving promotional targeting particular users. and particular markets, we can with payments platform. And we now have enough experience under our belt, enough instrumentation around that, that we can treat that as you mentioned, as a marketing investment.  And look at it in a very similar way to the way we look at spend in the performance channels for example, count, compare ROI s one versus the other, and decide what the right mix is. So correct, with payments becoming a bigger piece of all proposition, where we can, where we need to, where we think it makes sense. We can look our merchandising through a strong ROI [Indiscernible]. We can be quite proactive in that area and compare it directly with other forms of spending and marketing.\nStephen Ju: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have Doug Anmuth, of the JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask about social advertising and if the dollars there are still small, but just curious what gives you the confidence and that working to the point of potentially adding some real dollars there? It's an area you've tried before, so just curious kind of what's different now? And then secondly, David, if you could just walk through those 4Q sequential revenue dynamics again, and if there's something that's particularly different, as opposed to just the normal seasonality? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Doug. Yes. So absolutely small numbers right now, and I think I said that in my prepared remarks. These are small, small numbers right now. But obviously, there are a huge number of potential customers who are in those areas where we want to reach out, make sure they're aware of us, they're coming to us. So, it's a place that we're not going to ignore.  Now, we onset to come up with the right method, the right way to present and offer it, the way we are going to present our brand and be able to get them to come to us, and that means we've got to be able to measure, are we getting a good return or not. And I don't want to give too much in terms of sales, how we're doing what we're doing, but I'm feeling good about how we're building it up. And if we see the right returns, the right ROIs, because we are always very conscious of spending that advertising money the right way, then we will scale up and spend more money.  And then as I said in the prepared remarks, I feel good about where we are now because a great thing about our business, our Company, the way we think is, we're not dogmatic. We don't think just because we thought it first this would be great but then we absolutely do it. We're going to do it experiment, put money to work, see the results, test, and then we'll learn, and if it's great, we're going to put more money. If not, we'll come up with another way. That's how we built this Company, that's what we're doing in the future. And David, I think there's a question for you there.\nDavid Goulden: Yeah. Doug, let me explain that -- re-explain that whole seasonality thing because this is quite important than we can explain it high level. So Q3 was very strong. It was always artificially strong from a revenue for me because you've got two things naturally healthy it. First of all, remember a lot of bookings in Q1, Q2 that we're always stay in Q1, Q2 stayed in Q3. So, we got that benefit compared to the normal Q3.  On top of that, in the quarter, more bookings in Q3, the normal stayed in Q3. So, because of what you window while so short, so Q3 got topped up two ways from Q1, Q2 and in Q3. So now when you think of Q4 and you are now comparing it against a very top up Q3, Q3, and some of that top of in Q3 directly impacts Q4. So Q4 gets impacted by comparing against a strong Q3. But I think some those Q3 bookings that normally would stay in Q4 stay in Q3, to now book, if you like a double factor driving the comparison between Q3 and Q4.  Also, we believe the booking window will start expanding Q4 so more than bookings in Q4 will actually leak out of Q4 than did in Q3 relatively. So, you've got these two factors kind of driving a very unusual comparison between Q3 and Q4. So, a fair amount more sequential revenue decline. It's all timing and all mechanics. But think of it as a Q4 comparing a Q3 on steroids. And some of the reason why Q3 was in steroids will directly impact Q4 because that's what's going on.\nDoug Anmuth: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for the clarity there.\nOperator: And that concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to A - Glenn Fogel for closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. So, in closing, I want to repeat what I said at the close of last quarter's earnings call, and reiterate our strong belief that our industry's full recovery will be hastened by everyone who can get a vaccine, going out and getting it. We urge all people who are approved for and medically able to be vaccinated, to do their part, to make our society safer.  And we urge all who were advised to get a booster, to go get one. And as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our Company. Thank you and please be safe. Goodnight.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yeah, I'm calling back in Glenn. Sorry, have you just finished? All right. Perfect timing, thank you. I was cut off and I'm back in again. Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our results for the third quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the fourth quarter. To avoid comparisons to the pandemic impacted periods in 2020, all growth rates are relative to comparable periods in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results, can be found in our earnings release. Now onto our results for the third quarter.  On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends that that we saw throughout the second quarter driven by the U.S. and Europe, followed by loss pullback in July. After our earnings call, we saw our overall trends improve in August and continue to get better in September, which resulted in Q3 reported remise declining 18% versus Q3 2019, which was ahead of the 26% decline in Q2 and the 22% decline in July.  September was the strongest month in the third quarter, we remise declining for 14%, about the same level as June. The improvements in the Q3 room night decline versus Q2 was driven primarily by Europe, which benefited from strong cross-border travel with a duration. In Q3, room night in Europe, were down mid-single-digits versus 2019 with room night trends improving in August versus July, September was similar to August.  You will recall the room night growth pulled back from June to July in Europe due to concerns over the Delta variance. Rest-of-world also improved from Q2 to Q3. In the U.S we --, Q2 to Q3. However, the U.S. still have strong growth in the quarter and remained our strongest performing major country in Q3. Within the U.S. we saw a meaningful slowdown in August from the very strong growth we experienced in July, followed by a recovery to strong growth in September. The slowdown in the U.S. in August with due to concerns about the Delta variance.  Asia room night declined in Q3, or about in line with Q2. Room nights in Asia was still down significantly from 2019 levels. Mobile bookings primarily through our apps, represented about 2/3 of our total room nights are. Our apps continue to represent an increasing percentage of our mobile bookings. In Q3, as Glenn mentioned, we achieved an important milestone in use of our app at Booking.com, surpassing 100 million monthly active users.  We are also pleased to see the number of unique customers booking via our app in the quarter, grow strongly compared with Q3 2019. Our direct channel as a percentage of our room nights, year-on-year, and relative to Q3 2019, increased. While international room nights remain down versus 2019, we saw no sequential improvements in our international trends, with international mix of our room nights increasing to about 33% in Q3 from about 25% in Q2, and about 15% in Q1. Most of this improvement in international room nights came from bookings for travel within Europe. We continued to see double-digit growth in domestic room nights in Q3, but at a slightly lower level than in Q2. The pickup in international travel in the quarter was a driver of the improvement in overall room night trends from Q2 to Q3. However, international room nights were down almost 50% compared with Q3 2019 levels. Our Q3 cancellation rate was slightly above Q3 2019 levels. However, cancellation rates improved in the quarter and September was slightly better than 2019 for the month. Percentage of our 2,000 -- of our Q3 2021 bookings, made with flexible cancellation policies, remains significantly higher than in Q3, 2019.  The booking window of Booking.com remains shorter than it was in the third quarter of 2019 and contracted more they did in Q2, as we saw a high mix of near-term bookings during our peak summer season. All regions had a shorter booking window in Q3 than in Q3, 2019. alternative accommodations that the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3, 2019. The increase mix alternative accommodations in the quarter was less than it was in Q2, as we saw, a great sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3.  I will turn into Cornish room nights in Europe grew slightly in August and September versus 2019 down for the quarter were about in line with Q3 2019. We believe we benefited from the strength of our portfolio Europe where we could respond to solid demand for alternative accommodations and an improving demand for hotels. Gross bookings declined 6% in Q3, which is less than the decline in room nights due to the increase in average day rates for accommodations of about 10% versus 2019 on a constant-currency basis.  And also due to a couple of points of benefit from changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flight business. Our accommodations constant currency ADR benefited by just over 5% points for an increased mix of business in North America, which is a high ADR region, and a decrease of mix in Asia, which is a low ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up just about 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in Europe and North America across many destination-types with notable strength in beach-oriented leisure destinations.  [Indiscernible] figures booked in the third quarter were up 131% versus 2019, driven by very strong growth of Priceline. [Indiscernible] flight bookings at Booking.com We're encouraged to see another quarter of triple-digit growth from a [Indiscernible], which are key components of our multi-product Connected Trip strategy. [Indiscernible] revenue for third quarter was 4.7 billion, which was 7% below Q3, 2019, and was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2, 2021, a far greater sequential improvement in 2019. Our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with Q3 2019, which was in line with our expectations.  We experienced even more revenue seasonality in Q3 2021 than normal due to the concentration stays in Q3 from bookings made in the quarter and also for bookings [Indiscernible] when customers could book accommodations, but could not stay due to restrictions and other COVID related concerns. The strong top-line performance for performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion in the third quarter, which is 15% below Q3, 2019. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, decreased 3% versus Q3, 2019.  Marketing expense declined by few points less than gross bookings, due to slightly up low ROI in paid channels of the invested into capturing demand during the peak travel season. Sales to our expenses in Q3 were significantly higher than they were in Q2 on a dollar basis, due to higher volume of merchant gross bookings, which increased as a percentage of our total gross bookings in the third quarter. Our Booking.com announced a gross bookings process to our payment. Payment platform in Q3 was over $6 billion, which was almost 1/3 of Booking.com's business, up from about a quarter in Q2.  Our more fixed expense categories in Q3, in aggregate, came in 3% lower than Q2, after $136 million of personnel expense in the second quarter related to our decision to repay the government aid was mostly offset by an increase from Q2 to Q3 in our bonus accruals and digital service tax expense, both of which are crude proportional to revenue. Our non-GAAP EPS was $37.70, down 17% versus Q3 2019. non-GAAP net income of $1.6 billion reflects a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%, which is higher than the 19% in Q3 2019 due to a high proportion of non-tax-deductible expenses in relation to lower pre -tax income versus 2019.  On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $2 billion in Q3. We recorded GAAP net income of $769 million in the quarter, which includes a $1 billion pre -tax realized loss on our equity investments primarily relates to our [Indiscernible], as well as income tax expense of a $199 million. Now onto our cash and liquidity position, our Q3 ending cash investments balance of $15.4 billion was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $16.1 billion at the $1.5 billion of free cash flow was more than offset by the repayments for $1 billion convertible note matured in Q3 and the $1 billion unrealized loss on our equity investments.  The return of capital to shareholders, has and will be an important component of our value creation strategy. Throughout the COVID pandemic, we said that we will start returning capital to shareholders when we saw that our 3 largest regions, we're no longer a meaningful risk of [Indiscernible] reversal due to COVID, and also become more predictable. Assuming that travel recovery continues, we plan to restart returning capital in early 2022 under our remaining authorization.  Assuming continued recovery, we'd expect to complete this organization within 3 years from restarting. Now onto our thoughts for the fourth quarter. Our total room nights declined 10% versus 2019, which is better than the 14% decline in September. The improvements in October were driven mainly by Asia. Although the region comes -- a lot of the region remains down from suitably visiting. 2019. The improvement in Asia was led by domestic travel with the many countries and was driven by an improving vaccination progress and governments easing restrictions on travel.  Room night growth in the U.S. improved little from September to October and remains strong in October. Rest of the world also improved little in October, and was back close to 2019 levels. We were declines in Europe were about the same in October as they were in September, but weaken towards the end of the month. This resulted in overall room night declines being higher in the last week of October than the average for the month.  The slowdown at the end of October in Europe was driven by a number of countries that have seen recent increases in COVID infections, including Germany, Russia, and Italy. Given the ongoing uncertainty around COVID, it's difficult to predict how room nights in November-December will compare with the 10% reduction we saw in October. Looking forward to November-December, the rising case counts across many important Western European countries and across much of Eastern Europe, as well as the start of the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere, which in 2020 contributed to an increase in COVID cases, creates unpredictability.  Also, pre -pandemic contribution of Asia to total room nights was highest in November and December, and Asia is still our least recovered region. On a more positive note, since the U.S. announced in late September the plans to ease travel restrictions in November for international travelers who are vaccinated, we've seen a significant improvement in room nights booked by Europeans to travel to the U.S. as well as the reverse. Also, we're pleased to see more gross bookings on the books for the Christmas, New Year periods, that we saw at this time in 2019 in the U.S. and Western European. Change to the Income statement, we expect Q4 gross bookings to decline by a few points, less the room nights, driven by higher reported ADRs and flight bookings versus 2019. We expect less of an increase in our ADRs in Q4 than Q3 due to less of benefit from regional mix of the Asia region continues to recover, but also due to low occupancy rates after the peak travel season. We expect Q4 revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to a couple of factors.  The first, is due to short booking window in Q3. A low percentage of Q3 bookings [Indiscernible] normal will stay in Q4. The second, is due to our expectation that the booking window will contract less in Q4 than it did in Q3, resulting in more bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check-in in future quarters. As a result, we expect our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be more than 1% below Q4, 2019. This also means we expect Q4 revenue to have a greater sequential decrease from Q3, that we saw in 2019, and we expect Q4 revenue to decline more than it did in Q3.  We expect Q4 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings increased slightly versus 2019, as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect Q4 sales or expenses to be lower than they were in Q3 due to lower merchant transaction volumes. However, we expect sales or expenses in the fourth quarter to be higher than in Q4 2019 due to higher merchant, volumes, and mix.  We expect our more fixed expense categories in Q4 in aggregate to be about in line with Q3 on a dollar basis. We expect Q4 EBITDA to be positive but driven largely by the higher, the normal seasonal decrease in revenue, we expect a much greater seasonal sequential decrease in EBITDA from Q3 to Q4, the normal. In conclusion, we're pleased with our recovery and the top-line in Q3, which led to strong finance results for the quarter. The financial strength we saw in Q3 was [Indiscernible] by the concentration of stage in the quarter, which will lead to some differences in the comparison of Q4 to Q3 relative to what we've seen in prior years.  October room night trends improve relative to September, driven by some encouraging trends at Asia. However, recently, the rising case counts across Europe increases in certainty about how trends will progress in November and December. In closing with confidence in our ability to capture demand as the global recovery continues and execute against our strategic projects. With that, I will now take your questions and Eli, I'll turn over to you to open the line for questions. Yeah. So now, I [Indiscernible] as great, we'd actually be [Indiscernible] relatively quick on the puts and takes in the core combination business. Our underlying take rates have been solid, and obviously, the reported take rates are a function of timing, so that continues to go well for us. As we get to -- back to 2019 levels, there will be some inflation refresher on the personnel line. Everybody knows there's a war for tech talents out there, and we've had two for years whether the merit increases in other expenses in -- other increases in our cost base.  Of course, we did take expenses out, but there are variable expenses. So, they will come back with some efficiency over time, but there will be some pressure on the personnel line. But there are other things that are in the model that we can use to offset that pressure. We can get extra economy to scale as the business growth is beyond 2019 levels on both the fixed costs and on the variable cost side as well. There are opportunities in our direct mix, which of course is very important. And of course, a key element.  And this will grow happens to off over ROIs. And on the front marketing side where we saw some increase in the first half of the year, we saw some small compression in the second-half of this year, but those markets are very variable and very dynamic, and we're pleased with how we're doing in those markets. The last thing I want to leave you with on that topic is that within our core business, there's always a trade-off between growth market share, and profitability.  So, to the extent we see opportunities, we leaning in. We want to try and drive market share increases where we think that we can, that will pressure the business in the short-term as we lean into making those investments. And also, as the investment in marketing and other areas were basically be a leading indicated relative to revenue. So, there will -- we do believe that we're -- there are opportunities for us to gain share in accommodations through this -- the recovery and beyond. So that would be an additional factor in the mix and how we think about the long-term business margin in accommodations. Exactly. Thank you. Let us do that. So, Kevin, if you remember we -- on the last call, we said that we expect to see some reduction in our rise in Q3 versus 2019 and actually, our rise came out very much where we expected them to. Actually, our direct mix was slightly better than we expected in Q3. And that's why those less of a compression in the difference between gross bookings and marketing that we actually expected in Q3.  So that's positive. If it really -- something that we -- I say that was more what we did because we expect that to be the outcome. Of course, these markets are dynamic and as recovery continues, more, more play will come back into the marketplace. But basically, what happened in Q3 was very much in line with what we've told you a quarter ago would happen. The mix in between brands and the performance has not materially changed. If you recall, back in 2019, around 9% of all marketing spend was in imports, marketing.  We are looking to move up -- to move the brand spend up a little bit over time. But of course, brand has been very much shut down in 2020. It's not going back on in 2021. So, we're not in a very different position than where we were in 2019, but we do see the opportunity to continue to trend a little bit more towards brands, some of which might go on at the mid-funnel (ph.) market opportunities that Glenn talked about. And then Glenn, I'll turn -- hand over to you to talk about the 3rd one. Yeah, Zach (ph.). Q3 saw strong recovery across the geographies that we talked about. So, I'd say there's still a bias towards more leisure outdoor-oriented activity, particularly beach-oriented properties did very well in the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere.  But we do see some recovery into the cities as well, and I think this -- we all know that anecdotally, if you want to book a hotel room night in a city, it's becoming increasingly hard. So, we are seeing recovery across the board, although still more entry (ph.) towards the outdoor beach-oriented leisure locations. Yeah, I got number 2. And Mark, what I can tell you is we kind of watch very carefully how different types of direct user response. And obviously, the more direct we can get, the better. And the more those direct customers returned and there are three types of direct customers. The direct customers using the app, the direct customers that come to us on the mobile web, the direct customers who comes to us on desktop.  And perhaps not too surprisingly, the direct customers on the app measured by the [Indiscernible] you just talked about, are most [Indiscernible] of their customers. It's a good thing. We will get more of that. And a lot of our marketing that we do these days [Indiscernible] oriented. I'd getting people to download and use the app because it's sticky. That was good. I just point out that to your point, that does strengthen that balance in both clearly contributed to us having a strong Q3 because we saw strong demand in [Indiscernible] to continue that we saw sequentially, a much bigger increase from Q2 to Q3 in hotels that we could off the book. Sure, as Glenn said, payments is increasingly becoming heart of the core value proposition that we offer at booking.com in particular to both customers and partners. It's no longer just kind of we think as add-on, it really is solving problems for both all of them in cost-effective ways and risk reduction ways, they couldn't do as efficiently themselves. So as much as ROI is growing so rapidly, changing all that mix. Now, you're right, Steve. Once we're on payments, we can participate in merchandising.  Of course, with the most efficient way to get rates, is to source great rates, which Glenn talked about, frame out additional lines. But if we need to participate over and above sourcing and driving promotional targeting particular users. and particular markets, we can with payments platform. And we now have enough experience under our belt, enough instrumentation around that, that we can treat that as you mentioned, as a marketing investment.  And look at it in a very similar way to the way we look at spend in the performance channels for example, count, compare ROI s one versus the other, and decide what the right mix is. So correct, with payments becoming a bigger piece of all proposition, where we can, where we need to, where we think it makes sense. We can look our merchandising through a strong ROI [Indiscernible]. We can be quite proactive in that area and compare it directly with other forms of spending and marketing. Yeah. Doug, let me explain that -- re-explain that whole seasonality thing because this is quite important than we can explain it high level. So Q3 was very strong. It was always artificially strong from a revenue for me because you've got two things naturally healthy it. First of all, remember a lot of bookings in Q1, Q2 that we're always stay in Q1, Q2 stayed in Q3. So, we got that benefit compared to the normal Q3.  On top of that, in the quarter, more bookings in Q3, the normal stayed in Q3. So, because of what you window while so short, so Q3 got topped up two ways from Q1, Q2 and in Q3. So now when you think of Q4 and you are now comparing it against a very top up Q3, Q3, and some of that top of in Q3 directly impacts Q4. So Q4 gets impacted by comparing against a strong Q3. But I think some those Q3 bookings that normally would stay in Q4 stay in Q3, to now book, if you like a double factor driving the comparison between Q3 and Q4.  Also, we believe the booking window will start expanding Q4 so more than bookings in Q4 will actually leak out of Q4 than did in Q3 relatively. So, you've got these two factors kind of driving a very unusual comparison between Q3 and Q4. So, a fair amount more sequential revenue decline. It's all timing and all mechanics. But think of it as a Q4 comparing a Q3 on steroids. And some of the reason why Q3 was in steroids will directly impact Q4 because that's what's going on."

I am pleased to be reporting strong results today for our peak travel season. Compared with 2019, Q3 room nights were down 18% which was an improvement from the 22% decline we previously reported for the month of July, and the 26% decline in Q2. The improvement since July was primarily driven by stronger room night trends in Europe. In the United States, room night growth in Q3 was strong, but lower than Q2.  Asia room night declines in Q3, were about an online with Q2 and remain down significantly versus 2019. International travel, which is important to our business, drove the overall sequential improvement in room night trends from Q2 to Q3. Nevertheless, our international room nights remain significantly depressed versus 2019. Q3 consolidated revenue of $4.7 billion, was more than double the amount of revenue in Q2.  The third quarter was also our most profitable quarter since Q3, 2019, with $2.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA and a 45% adjusted EBITDA margin. Moving into the fourth quarter, we have seen a further improvement in our room night trends in October, including early signs of a pickup in room night trends in Asia. Now, well, recently rising COVID case counts in many countries, including several important European countries, adds to the uncertainty around how November and December trends will progress.  David will provide additional details on our third quarter results in what we are seeing so far in the fourth quarter, in his remarks. The improvement in trends we saw in the third quarter. And so far in the fourth quarter following the negative impact for the Delta variant in July and August, once again, demonstrates the resilience of leisure travelers, who are looking to travel, when it is safe to do so, and restrictions are lifted. We are confident that we are on the path to the eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally.  As the global recovery continues, we are making progress, strengthening our core accommodation businesses support its long-term growth. As I said before, the strength of our core business comes from driving benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike. For our customers, we are aiming to create a superior booking experience and build stronger relationships, which we believe is accomplished by addressing our customers critical needs of value, choice, and ease-of-use.  We continue to see Booking.com's pre-pandemic customers coming back and booking with us, while we're also attracting new customers. Importantly, we see our top customers from before the pandemic were turning to us at a meaningfully higher frequency than other customers. Providing attractive prices on accommodations is a key component of offerings value for our customers.  We work closely with our supply partners to increase participation in our targeted rate programs to ensure that compelling prices are available to our customers. Our Genius loyalty program at booking.com is a great example of a program where hundreds of thousands of our property partners are participating to offer lower rates and other benefits such as complementary practice, room upgrades, and discounted airport taxi to our large customer base.  In addition to offering lower rates on accommodations, we have recently extended lower rates on rental cars to our Genius customers. This is just 1 example of the way we continue to innovate and add value for our Genius members. With about 2/3 of our room nights booked on mobile devices, and the majority of those booked through the app, it's critical that we provide our customers with a positive booking experience on our app.  The app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and ultimately, we see it as the center of our Connected Trip experience. In the third quarter, booking.com was once again the number one downloaded OTT app globally, according to a third-party research firm. Also, in the third quarter, we surpassed 100 million monthly active app users for the first time. The recent growth of Booking.com's app is encouraging, and we are working hard to continue to build on this success. In the third quarter, we saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the third quarter of 2019.  A direct mix improved even as we leaned into performance marketing channels during our peak travel season. While we will continue to invest in performance marketing, we will also look to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels, as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increase consumer awareness of our brands. For example, with our ambition to acquire more customers in the medium intense space, we've made progress in strengthening our foundations for digital marketing, including social channels.  Though us spend so far has been small. However, we're increasingly confident in the potential for these channels. And as we see positive results, we expect to raise our level of participation there. Remaining active in investing effectively across marketing channels, is made even more important by the opportunity to acquire focus for new to online booking channels. Travel, like many industries during pandemic, has seen a meaningful shift from offline to online according to third-party data.  And this has increased our addressable market. For our support partners, we are focused on bringing incremental demand to their properties from a broad audience of potential customers on our platform. In a certainty of 600 small and medium hoteliers in Europe conducted earlier this year, 85% percent of respondents agreed that online platforms are a cost-efficient way to increase the reach to their hotel and source more diverse, yes. We agree with this statement and believe it applies more broadly.  Whether we are working with a small and medium hotel in Europe, or an alternative accommodation, or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform. With our chain hotel partners, we are continuing to see increased engagement relative to 2019 levels, which shows up in higher levels of participation in our programs that enable them to differentiate and promote themselves on our platform. For our alternative accommodations, the global mix of room nights in Q3 of about 30% was up slightly from Q3, 2019.  This increase in [Indiscernible] recombination share of our business in the quarter was less than it was in Q2 as we saw a greater sequential improvement in demand for hotel room nights in Europe from Q2 to Q3. Our property counts of about 2.4 million and reported listings of over 28 million on booking.com remains stable relative to the prior quarter. Let me talk more about some of our key strategic priorities. Payments, and the Connected Trip, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business, and support its continued growth.  Turning to payments of Booking.com. Last quarter, we spoke about the organization of all of our payments, initiatives and efforts within a new Fintech unit at booking.com The recently established Fintech nearly enables booking.com to have a dedicated focus on enhancing payments in our core business to both customers and partners, as well as monetizing our overall transaction flows, be a new payments, related products, and services. Adoption of our payment solutions by our supply partners in both the U.S. and Europe continues to grow. Adoption in the U.S. has seen significant increases recently, driven by the additions of some major hotel chains in the second and third quarters, which we will look to build on in the fourth quarter.  In Europe, more customers are choosing to pay using booking.com 's payment platform when finalizing their booking as an attractive and localized options are provided. This will result in nearly a third of booking.com 's total gross bookings in Q3 being processed through our payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full-year 2020. The Fintech unit is also driving continued payments innovation to ensure that growth is sustained into the future.  This includes offering a low-cost payout choice to our suppliers, as well as partnering with third-parties to provide payment solutions to our buckets, such as, buy now pay later. We believe these efforts help position booking.com as near transit and trusted payment intermediary for all parties on our platform. On our Connected Trip vision, we've been focused this year on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their attributing one place on Booking.com.  We continue to work on scaling up our robust flight platform on booking.com which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel generally, and allow us an opportunity to across LOR accommodation and other services to these bookers. Booking.com's for the product is now live in 27 countries. Total Company air tickets in the third quarter was up 131% versus Q3 2019, primarily driven by strength in Priceline's, but also helped by Booking.com slight offering, which continues to meaningfully exceed our expectations. Wallet remains early days for Booking slight product.  We're seeing that over 25% of Booking's flight bookers, are entirely new customers. With these new customers, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of accommodation bookings. However, there is more work to be done to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity. The early signals helped demonstrate though, that our flight offering can drive incremental new customers to the platform to which we can cross-sell our combination product.  We are beginning to test initiatives targeting these new flight customers, including, for example, encouraging account creation to activate Genius status, and in some cases, offering additional incentives for them to book accommodations. We remain focused on continuing to test and innovate in order to build on the early successes, we're seeing with flight at Booking.com. We're also continuing to run test using offerings from our verticals like rental cars and taxis.  Before closing, I do want to note that as world leaders assemble this week in Glasgow for the cop26 Summit discussing the urgency of tackling the global climate crisis. I cannot overstate the importance for our industry to come together to work for the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. De - carbonization is a major challenge for the entire industry. Excelling this challenge requires the commitment of all stakeholders. I am proud to say that our Company, Booking Holdings, is committed to addressing this challenge.  We recently released a report that we commissioned with EY-Parthenon that looks into what will it take to get the accommodations industry specifically to a carbon-neutral future. While a big task, data shows it is achievable. At booking.com, we are working on making it easier for travelers to find and choose sustainable accommodation options with booking their travel. In addition, we're working with our accommodation supply partners by sharing guidance, insights, and best practices to enhance sustainability initiatives at the property level.  Of course, there is much more that must be done, but we believe that we are taking important steps to contribute to a more sustainable future for our industry. And finally, we plan on publishing a Booking Holdings, climate transition plan in early 2022, which we'll speak more about at that time. In conclusion, we executed well and produced strong results in our peak travel season, which is a credit to the hard work and support provided by the many teams across our Company. I'm encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in many parts of the world.  And I'm confident that we are on the path to an eventual strong recovery in travel demand globally. We continue with our important work to strengthen our Company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. As I said before, we were thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand, and we are focused on building a larger and faster growing business that generates more earnings after the full recovery, and for the long run. And now turn the call over to our CFO, A - David Goulden, David [Indiscernible] David is dialing back in, I think. Yes. I just finished. Hi, Justin. I don't think it's a very hard answer really what we need. What we need is, obviously, more of a recovery against this pandemic, because that's clearly what's driving the problem than in many industries, ours particularly. For us, we've talked about this a few times. We talked about, our business has done well with international, and international generally has been hard hit, albeit we are seeing some better things. But that the long haul is still a problem. Yes, we're seeing some numbers coming up in Asia, great. I love it. The fact that people are getting more vaccinated in Asia, that's great. The fact that vaccines are being distributed more broadly and getting around, that's great.  The fact that the pharmaceutical Companies are coming out with new ways to combat against this terrible virus with pills now, that can help people who have caught it, end up being hopefully healthier quicker, all good things. But what we need really, is for everyone who can get a vaccine, to please go out and get that vaccine. If you're medically able to and you're capable getting it, please get. That will help hasten the recovery for not only the travel industry, but the entire world. And that's what we hope will happen.  Obviously, we're doing everything we can, so we're prepared when that day comes, which it will, we can't say when, but we know will come. And we're preparing by doing all the things that Dave and I have been talking about. Preparing with our partners, and getting our marketing prepared, and doing all the steps that you know we've been doing to make sure that when travel comes back to above 2019, we're getting the share we want to be getting. And David, you want to [Indiscernible] -- you're going to answer the second question and answer mine too. David, why don't you take the first 2, about the aired competitiveness, and I think some brand question? And I will talk a bit about some of the merchandising. Yeah. So, Kevin, obviously, merchandising is a very important reason why we built out, and are continuing to build-out, our payments platform in booking.com. Just making sure that we're able to compete and provide great value to our customers. And what's really important is not doing just out of our own pocket, but working with our partners, coming up with the right time to the right consumer, the right offer and helping them.  Our supply partners, also provide some of that, let's say, added value. For example, we may do flash sales. You may hope or you've seen some. Hope you've gotten some, hope you actually booked some of them. That's an example. One of the things, for example, when somebody is getting in accommodation and we are able to offer them either lower cost or even free sometimes, right from the airport to the hotel. In a [Indiscernible], different variations that we can do with the different verticals in coming up with the best combination, trying to do as much as we can with our suppliers' money, but sometimes using our own too to come up what really is an attractive offer. So, the consumer knows that when it come to our site, they're getting the best value, because value really is one of the key strategic objectives for us, always through providing that. Zach, so just to make sure I understood your first part of your question. You're just asking a little bit about how we're going to get the demand that's coming in the future, do I have that correct? Right. Okay. Yeah. Right. I got it. Okay. Why don't you about first half, but I'll let David say wherever we are -- what we feel, we can disclose regarding any of the trends regarding different parts of the business. So, we absolutely know there's huge pent-up demand by of course any time, any government, let's go restriction. We see immediate, immediate demand. So, for example, the announcement of the November 8th opening for people to come to the U.S. Immediately, we saw demand. In the U.K. when they changed restriction, immediate demand. So, we know it's there.  Absolutely. Now, how much have we don't have a way to quantify it, but we do note if you look at particularly in the U.S., when you look at what people savings rates are right now, you have been able to save a lot of money during this pandemic and they want to spend it. And one thing people have not been able to do as much they want to, is go travel.  So, I believe there is a significant amount of demand there, just waiting to come out. But of course, you'd have to -- we have to have these restrictions for the long-haul international travel open up. And we also -- we know that it's important that we always provide the best value so that when they do travel, they come to us and David what you can say about suburban and local far what you can say. Thanks Mark. Why don't I take -- let me do the air question first, then I'll talk a little bit about IDFA, and I'll let David what he wants to say about our app and I'm not sure how -- I'll let him be streets if you wanted to be or not about what we see ensuring profitability, etc. You're absolutely right about the air business very exciting for us, of course, and we've been working on it. And it's interesting because I happen to have noticed that in the first quarter call in 2020, just as things started going very bad for the whole world.  We're talking about the -- just starting out the air business at Booking.com in the fourth quarter of 2019. And I mentioned about we're striving to get to that 50% coverage of Booking.com customers. I was looking forward to hopefully doing that for 2020. And of course, that didn't quite happen exactly we wanted, but the question and it wasn't from you, Mark, who is another analyst to ask that why not a 100%. And I said, well, the 15% was just don't want to get to that year. [Indiscernible] of course, we want to get to a 100% and that still is the same thing. Yes, we're 27 countries, of course, we want to get to every single country, to anybody we currently deal with.  We want to be able to provide them with an air ticket, but it takes time. It's not something you just flip a switch. You have to actually go to regulation is to get licensing and all sorts of things. So, we're enrolling out as we can, as we should, and we will get to a 100% at some point, I do want to point out though we are at that over that 50% number right now. So, I am pleased to where we are with that. I also want to say though it's still so early, we're not doing big marketing yet, real big marketing. There are a lot of opportunities to get a much higher number of people come into this air product.  And the reason that we like it, is not only the 25% new customers, of course fantastic, but it's that attachment rate, which I haven't given a number. But I'm pleased with where we are with that right now. And again, that's something we have not optimized yet. There's a lot of opportunity there to optimize that and get an even higher attachment rate. And that's part of the overall vision of being able to bring new customers in from different verticals, different ways than we've done in the past, which is primarily pay for performance marketing and delivering a lot more customer. And as we talked a little bit earlier in a previous answer about being able to provide them with a lot more value.  Your first question about IDFA, but these privacy related changes, they only impact a small part of our marketing, and it's obviously not unique to our Company. We know that very confident, we can manage through this. And as we know -- as you know, most of our marketing primarily paid marketing channels like PPC and [Indiscernible] and that's not going to be directly impacted by any of these kinds of changes. Our focus has always first-party data. We want to leverage the data into marketing, any of these changes to privacy, like the IDFA -- thing is this does not really impact us.  And I think you would know, we chose not to show us the app -- track and opt-in back in April 20 -- April 21 this year, April, while the IDFA specifically decided not to do that. And of course, you've seen our results since then, so I really don't think this is a big deal for us. Very proud of the team in our whole marketing. They will be able to work and come up with, I would say, privacy-oriented ways to continue to be able to market with good tracking and ROIs. And David, I think you had number 2, which is about the monthly active users through mobile. Thank you. I'll give my first comments and I'll let -- David can always add if he'd like. So, we saw before the pandemic an increase in the alternative accommodations business as they became a larger and larger share of the total combinations business. And we're just going on a pretty steady rate going up. And pandemic happens and you get a step change. As people desire safety, being away from crowds and they go there. And now we've seen for ourselves, we've seen people liking hotels in that. I think the long-term trend that will continue.  And I think if you look five years in the future, I think alternative combinations will be a higher share. That means of course for us. We talked about this in the past how important is that we go out, make sure we get the best supply we can get. And that means working hard on that and making sure that the people own these properties, see us as a platform that they want to use, and it's first in their mind that this is a great way to fill up their properties, and that's something that we are working on absolutely.  The demand side similar. Go to Europe, and we've talked about in the past, and says, where can I get a villa? In the south of France, people will say, I think booking.com 's a great place. You went to the U.S. and we said, hey, I need a vacation place to ski. They may not think of booking.com first. We got to get that awareness up and I've talked about that in the past and that's what we have to do also. But one of the truly great things about booking.com is we offer more of both. Nobody offers -- you put together hotels and alternative accommodations, you put that together, were the ones that have both of those.  And I really believe that's a superior way for somebody to decide what they're going to choose in terms of accommodation. And we see this in our data. We see people come, they look -- first, start looking at one type and then they end up booking another type. And they're able to compare and contrast both. They'll see the reviews on both. Look at the prices on both. What are they going to get from one, what are they going to get from the other? That's why we believe we have a superior offering to the consumer.  And I do believe though that is something that absolutely, it's going to continue. But on the other side, you all see the hotels they're making some moves themselves. And they're coming up with ways to offer a better wall frame, providing some of the benefits of an alternative accommodation. Two of this silver, particularly so they are prepared as people work in a new way in the future and want to have both the benefits of the hotel but perhaps more room or more services that you can get in terms of making sure you have good WiFi or a place you can do your work at. And that's some nice, see also hotels are definitely be getting to that space. David, I don't know if you want to say anything more to that. So, I'll talk about the first one about our payments. I'll let David talk about ROIs on our merchandising approach and how we're doing that. So, you're absolutely right. If somebody doesn't have the ability to pay for something because they don't have the appropriate payment method then they're not going to be able to buy from that person or in that Company like us. So, we always have to do that. So, if you are in Southeast Asia and let's say somebody is using most of the Grab, who is a partner of ours and they're using GrabPay.  Well, we're not able to use GrabPay for the hotel, taking the money in from the consumer, that person is not going to use us, they're going to use somebody else. We have obviously GrabPay our partner working on that. Or if you look at other ways, people who say they go and look, it's not their favorite, they could use it another way, they still decided not to use us. There's something else we've seen which is really interesting, is that just having more ways to accept payments seems to increase conversion sometimes.  I don't know why, I can give you a science, I just see data. This is a lot interesting. The other side is making sure we're paying the supplier the way they want to get the money. Because sometimes they say, you know I don't want to get it the way you're doing it with virtual credit card or I don't want to get it in terms of a bank transfer, I want to get it some other way. So, we've got to be able to do that, and that improves our relationship with the suppliers. If it particularly approves with the supplier when the method that we can get the money to them is cheaper than the method they are currently using.  That's a great thing when we can do that, that's another value add to that hotel or any other types of suppliers, lots of ways that we're going to do that and there are all other things we're working at, the ThinTec part of our business that we're just starting out. We talked last time about saving up that unit. There are a lot of opportunities there and we talked about how in 2019 we did over a $100 billion with a gross booking. And our idea is to -- let's find ways that we can monetize that better. And let's find ways we can provide value to both consumers and suppliers. And David, I don't know if you want to add a little ROIs and how we're doing merchandise. Hi, Doug. Yes. So absolutely small numbers right now, and I think I said that in my prepared remarks. These are small, small numbers right now. But obviously, there are a huge number of potential customers who are in those areas where we want to reach out, make sure they're aware of us, they're coming to us. So, it's a place that we're not going to ignore.  Now, we onset to come up with the right method, the right way to present and offer it, the way we are going to present our brand and be able to get them to come to us, and that means we've got to be able to measure, are we getting a good return or not. And I don't want to give too much in terms of sales, how we're doing what we're doing, but I'm feeling good about how we're building it up. And if we see the right returns, the right ROIs, because we are always very conscious of spending that advertising money the right way, then we will scale up and spend more money.  And then as I said in the prepared remarks, I feel good about where we are now because a great thing about our business, our Company, the way we think is, we're not dogmatic. We don't think just because we thought it first this would be great but then we absolutely do it. We're going to do it experiment, put money to work, see the results, test, and then we'll learn, and if it's great, we're going to put more money. If not, we'll come up with another way. That's how we built this Company, that's what we're doing in the future. And David, I think there's a question for you there. Thank you. So, in closing, I want to repeat what I said at the close of last quarter's earnings call, and reiterate our strong belief that our industry's full recovery will be hastened by everyone who can get a vaccine, going out and getting it. We urge all people who are approved for and medically able to be vaccinated, to do their part, to make our society safer.  And we urge all who were advised to get a booster, to go get one. And as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our Company. Thank you and please be safe. Goodnight."

And now, I would like to introduce Booking Holdings first speaker for this afternoon, Mr. Glenn Fogel. You may begin your conference.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I\u2019m encouraged by another quarter of meaningful improvement in our accommodations business with Q2 room nights up sequentially 59% versus Q1. This compares very favorably to our pre-pandemic historical pattern of a slight decline in Q2 room nights versus Q1. Compared with 2019, Q2 room nights were down 26%, which was significantly better than the 43% decline we previously reported for the month of April and a 54% decline in Q1. The acceleration in the second quarter was primarily driven by domestic and international booking trends in Europe, following a ramp up in vaccination rates and the relaxation of many travel restrictions in the region. Good growth of international bookings in Europe was mainly from bookings within the European region. The very strong room night growth in the United States that we saw in April and highlighted on our last earnings call continued in May and June, resulting in very strong US room night growth for the full quarter versus Q2 2019. David will provide additional details on our second quarter results in his remarks. We are, of course, closely monitoring the impact of the Delta variant on the rising COVID case counts around the world as well as some newly imposed travel restrictions, which have led to a modest pullback in our booking trends in the month of July relative to June. However, the July booking trends were improved from our full Q2 results. While the rise of the Delta variant demonstrates the volatility and uncertainty around the exact timing and shape of the recovery for travel, we remain confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. The sharp return to growth initially in the U.S and then in the European markets that we have witnessed this year shows us clearly that leisure travelers are eager to get back to booking trips on our platform when restrictions are lifted and customers are able to travel. We expect to be much closer to our 2019 revenue levels in Q3 than we were in Q2, driven by the strong booking improvements we have seen in the last few months. As we\u2019ve done throughout the pandemic, we will continue to build on the strengths of our poor accommodation business and support its long-term growth. The strength of our core business comes from the flywheel effect we get from our two sided marketplace where we drive benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike. For our customers, we strive to deliver the best choice of accommodations offer the most value and provide the easiest booking experience, all backed by excellent customer service and support. By addressing these critical needs of choice, value and ease, we create a superior booking experience and strengthen the relationships with our customers. I'm pleased to report that at Booking.com we are seeing pre-pandemic customers coming back to us to book their trips, while also attracting new customers. And the current mix of prior and new customers is not significantly different than prior to the pandemic. One of the ways we drive value to our large customer base at Booking.com is through our Genius Loyalty program. This program provides discounts for Genius members at hundreds of thousands of properties on our platform, and also offers value and other benefits like complimentary breakfast, free room upgrades, and more recently, discounted airport taxes just to name a few. We will continue innovating and adding to the ways we provide value to our Genius customers who have historically had a higher repeat rate and a higher mix of direct bookings when compared to non-Genius customers. Our app is an important way we deliver an easier booking experience to our customers. Globally, in Q2, Booking.com was the number one downloaded OTA app according to a third-party research firm. In the U.S., in Q2, we were the most downloaded major OTA app as downloads of Booking.com app in the second quarter significantly increased sequentially. We also saw U.S app user in Q2 meaningfully surpassed the prior peak observed before the COVID pandemic. In the second quarter, we again saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the comparable period in 2019. It is encouraging to see these gains even as we look for opportunities to lean into performance marketing channels, where we see attractive ROIs. We have a long history of effectively managing our performance marketing channels to bring bookers to our platform profitably. We plan to continue with this proven approach in the future. In addition, we're leveraging our marketing expertise and ROI focus as we test into other channels like social and digital media, as well as when we deploy promotional campaigns like our Back to Travel campaign, which we ran first in the U.S and then launched in the U.K and across Europe. We will continue to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increase consumer awareness of our brands. While we will remain focused on our efforts to grow and retain our customer base, we believe we will continue to benefit from the secular tailwind of more people booking their trips online instead of offline. Historically, the accommodation industry has seen a steady increase in online share each year. And looking ahead, we believe this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. In April, McKinsey published a 24 country survey with results showing that across 11 major consumer facing industries, travel had the greatest percentage of customers that plan to increase their usage of digital channels after the pandemic. On the other side of our marketplace, we are focused on helping our supply partners reach a broader audience of potential customers. Our scale and global reach allows us to connect our supply partners with a significant amount of demand from around the world, demonstrated by the 845 million room nights booked across our platforms in 2019. In addition to being a large demand channel for our partners, we add value to our accommodation partners in other ways by providing customer service support for travelers in over 40 languages, localized partner service support teams, market intelligence and data, product innovations in response to new traveler trends and fraud liability shift and access to alternative payment methods for payment enabled transactions. With an alternative accommodation or independent hotel, or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all types of accommodations on our platform. In the second quarter, we saw the first sequential increase in the number of properties on Booking.com and the lowest number of properties coming off of our platform in the quarter since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, we had over 28 million reported listings on Booking.com, of which 6.6 million were for alternative accommodation properties. Within alternative accommodations in the U.S., Booking.com continue to add targeted new properties in the corner, and also saw encouraging share gains with some of our larger professional managers. While these are positive early developments, we recognize there is much work ahead to improve and grow our alternative accommodations product in the U.S market. Our alternative accommodations business in Europe was strong in the quarter and represented an increasing share of our European accommodations business. I want to move to our key strategic priorities of expanding Booking.com's payment platform and building the Connected Trip vision, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodation business and support its continued growth. On our integrated payment platform at Booking.com, we have made continued progress with increasing the adoption of payments by our supply partners in the U.S., including adding some major hotel chains in the second quarter. Around 24% of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q2 were processed through its payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full year 2020. We recently announced the organization of all of our payments initiatives and efforts into a new fintech unit at Booking.com. First, the fintech unit will be focused on enabling bookings core business to run better, faster and more efficiently for both customers and our supply partners. In addition, we recognize that we have opportunities to better monetize our overall transaction flows. In 2019, we did almost $100 billion of transaction value, and we believe setting up a separate fintech unit to better capitalize on these flows will benefit us in the long run. On our Connected Trip vision, I mentioned on our last earnings call that the development of the Connected Trip this year will be focused on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. The top priority of this -- on this front has been to scale up a robust flight platform on Booking.com, which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey, and allow us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. Since our last earnings call, we have launched our flight product in six new markets, and now alive in 24 countries. In air tickets booked through bookings flight offering have continued to meaningfully exceed our expectations. However, these still represented a small portion of our total reported air tickets, which were up 120% in Q2 versus Q2 2019, primarily this is driven by Priceline. While it remains early days for Booking's flight product, we are seeing positive data indicating we are getting entirely new customers for Booking.com. In addition, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of a combination bookings from these new customers. These early data points help demonstrate that our flight offering creates a new funnel to bring incremental customers to the platform, and then cross-sell an accommodation to these new customers. We expect to continue to build on the early success we are seeing with flight at Booking.com. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in some parts of the world. And I'm confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. We continue with our most important work to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. And our teams are working hard to support the strong summer travel season this year in North America and Europe. As I said before, we are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. And we are focused on building a larger and faster growing business to generate more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David?\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the second quarter and provide some color on trends we've seen so far in the third quarter. To avoid comparison to pandemic impacted periods in 2020, all growth rates will be relative to comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the second quarter. On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends in Q1 which continued into April, driven by strong results in the U.S and improvements in Europe. On the earnings call, we saw the overall improvements in our trends accelerate in May and continue to get better in June, which resulted in our Q2 reported room nights declining 26% versus Q2 2019, which was significantly ahead of the 54% decline in Q1, a 43% decline we saw in April and our expectations in May. The improvement in Q2 room nights growth rate versus Q1 was driven by Europe and the U.S as well as better results in rest of world. Europe showed the greatest level of recovery in the quarter and actually achieved slight room night growth versus 2019 in June. Booking trends in Europe clearly benefited from a notable improvement in vaccination rates, as well as loosening travel restrictions. The U.S was again the strongest performing major country in Q2, and have very strong room night growth versus 2019 for the full quarter. Asia partially offset improvements in other regions with greater room night declines in Q2 than in Q1, due to the increase in COVID outbreaks with related travel restrictions. In the month of June, our room nights were down 13% and our monthly active unique customer accounts at Booking.com reached about 90% of the level we saw in June 2019. As Glenn mentioned, we are pleased to see the solid rebound in our customer base of Booking.com as well as a healthy mix of new customers, which is only a little lower than the mix of new customers in Q2 2019. Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, represented over 60% of our total room nights. Our app continues to represent an increased percentage of our mobile bookings. Our direct channel increased as a percentage of room nights year-on-year and relative to Q2 2019. Domestic room nights grew in the mid teens in Q2, while international room nights remained down significantly versus 2019, we saw a sequential improvement in our international bookings resulting in the international mix of our room nights increasing to about 25% in Q2 from about 15% in Q1. Our cancellation rates improved from Q1 and were in line with Q2 2019 levels in the quarter. The percentage of our Q2 2021 bookings made with flexible cancellation policies remain significant higher than in Q2 2019. The booking window Booking.com remained shorter than it was in the second quarter of 2019 as we continue to see a higher mix of near-term bookings. However, the booking window contract is less than it did in the prior three quarters. The mix of alternative accommodation room nights on Booking.com in Q2 was 32%, which is three points higher than Q1. In June, our alternative accommodation room night growth was flat versus June 2019, the first time we've reached 2019 levels for this segment since the start of COVID. The sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 was due primarily to the overall improvements in room night growth in Europe in the quarter. As we noted, last quarter, Europe is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodation remained about the same as Q1, this represents a continued increase from 2019 to 2020 and in to2021. Gross bookings declined 12% in Q2, which is less than the decline in reported room nights, due to an increase in average day rates for accommodations of a 11% versus 2019 on a constant currency basis, and also due to a few points of changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flights business. Our accommodation constant currency ADR benefited by about 7% from an increased mix of business in North America, which is the high ADR region and a decrease of mix of business in Asia, which is a lower ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADR was up approximately 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in North America and in Europe. The increase in North America were driven by high levels of demand for beach oriented leisure destinations. And in Europe were driven by a higher mix of summer bookings which have higher ADRs. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up 120% versus 2019, driven by strong growth of Priceline and by flight bookings of Booking.com and Agoda, neither of which have flight products in Q2 2019. We are encouraged to see another record breaking quarter for air tickets booked for our flights business, which is a key component of a multiproduct Connected Trip strategy. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $2.2 billion and decreased 44% versus 2019, which is better than our expectations. Revenue in the quarter declined meaningfully more than gross bookings due to bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check-in in future quarters at which point the revenue will be recognized. Take rates in Q2 were about 10%, largely driven by these timing differences. As you will recall, we discussed the impact of timing on take rates in Q1, Q2 and for the full year during our last call. We continue to expect these timing factors to impact full year take rates, although the second half of the year will be less notably impacted than the first half of the year. Removing the impact of timing, our take rates on accommodation bookings in Q2 were stable versus Q2 2019. The better-than-expected top line performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $48 million in the second quarter, which came in better than our expectations. With the exception of Q3 last year, this is the first EBITDA positive quarter since the first wave of COVID. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line decreased 29% versus 2019. Marketing expense declined more than gross bookings due to higher ROIs in the paid channels and the increase in our direct mix. Sales and other expenses in Q2 were significantly higher than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis. Sales and other expenses has a percentage of revenue in Q2 with better than our expectations due to lower-than-expected by debt and customer service related expenses. Personnel expenses in Q2 were higher than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis, primarily due to the $136 million expenses related to our decision to repay the government aid in the second quarter. Excluding this repayments, personnel expenses in Q2 would have been in line with our expectations. G&A and IT expenses were both higher in Q2 than it were in Q1 on a dollar basis, and we're in line with our expectations. We recorded a non-GAAP loss of $105 million in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we have an operating loss of $56 million in Q2. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $167 million in the quarter, which includes income tax expense of $146 million. On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, in Q2, we recorded a tax expense on a pre-tax loss due to higher earnings expectations for the full year relative to our expectations for Q1. For the full year, we expect on GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly higher than in 2019. Now onto our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $16.1 billion was down versus our Q1 ending balance of $16.4 billion. However, our Q1 ending balance benefited from the timing of the $2 billion raised in our euro bond offering which we completed in March and the subsequent redemption of the two higher coupon senior notes occurring in April. Adjusting our Q1 ending cash balance for the redemption of the two notes that happened in April would have resulted in an adjusted Q1 cash balance of $14.4 billion. Our Q2 ending balance was higher than this adjusted Q1 balance primarily due to operating cash flow of $1.2 billion and a $0.5 billion unrealized gain on long-term investments. $0.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter was driven almost entirely by change in working capital. Change in working capital represented source of cash of $1.2 billion in the quarter due to the increase in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities, partially offset by the increase in our accounts receivable. We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position given the continued uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. Of the $16.1 billion of cash and investments at the end of Q2, $4.3 billion was related to our long-term strategic investments, and $11.7 billion was cash and short-term investments. We ended the quarter with about $12.3 billion in debt, which is about $3.6 billion higher than our pre-pandemic levels. We have a 1 billion convertible note maturing in Q3. While return of capital to shareholders will be an important component of our value creation strategy in the future, we remain on pause and we will wait to reinitiate and so we believe each of our three major regions is beyond the risk of a significant reversal in trends due to COVID. We're not there yet, given the current trends we're seeing in Asia and with our current close watch on how things are developing in Europe. Now on to our thoughts for the third quarter. With the recent rising case counts driven by Delta -- by the Delta variant in many countries, some governments around the world have responded with new travel and leisure restrictions as well as some stricter vaccination and testing requirements for tourists. However, there are indications that hospitalization rates are lagging the recent increases in case counts, particularly in countries with high vaccination rates, which could be an important factor in how governments plan their responses to the recent increase in COVID cases. We're closely watching the U.K where the vaccination rate is high, and the government's move forward with relaxing travel restrictions despite rising case counts in the country, which are among the highest in Europe. We are encouraged by the recent decline in new case counts and by the continued low level of hospitalizations in the U.K compared with other outbreaks. We saw booking trends improved in the U.K in July, leading up to an after travel restrictions lifted on July 8 -- on July 19.  Our July room nights declined about 22% versus 2019, which was a modest pullback from the 13% decline in June, family just softening booking trends in Europe. Looking within Europe, we saw a reduction to room nights in July across several of our key countries including Germany, France and Italy. But despite the recent pullback in these countries at the end of July, we had a high amount of gross bookings on the books for the remaining summer period in Europe than we did this same point in time in 2019. Outside of Europe, the U.S continued to have very strong room night growth in July, although modestly below Q2 levels. While Asia and rest of world room night declined for about the same in July as it were in June. Asia continues to be the least recovered region in July and continues to be down significantly from 2019 levels. The changing growth rates from June to July were similar for domestic and international room nights with domestic remaining positive and international room nights remaining down significantly versus 2019. Given the recent additional uncertainty around COVID, driven primarily by the Delta variant, it's difficult to predict exactly how room nights in August and September will compare with a 22% reduction we saw in July. Turning to the income statement. We expect Q3 gross bookings to decline several points less than room nights, driven by expected improvements in reported areas and my flight bookings. We expect that the Q3 revenue decline will significantly improve from Q2 reflecting the strong improvement in bookings in the last few months. I just mentioned we have more gross bookings for the summer than at this time in 2019 for Europe. The same is also true for North America. We expect our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings will increase meaningfully from Q2 due to the high concentration of checkings expected in the third quarter and will be about in line with Q3 2019. As a reminder, the exact relationship between revenue and gross bookings in Q3 will be impacted by how our bookings trend in August and September. We expect marketing expenses in Q3 will decline several points less than gross bookings, as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the peak travel season and ahead of the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect sales and other expenses in Q3 to be up significantly versus Q2 on dollar basis due to higher gross booking volumes in the third quarter as well as a mix -- as well as an increase in the mix of gross bookings process on a merchant basis. However, we expect sales and other as a percentage of revenue in Q3 will be a bit lower than in future. We expect our more fixed expense categories in Q3 in aggregate to be about in line with Q2 on a $1 basis. We expect Q3 EBITDA will be the highest since Q3 2019. In conclusion, we have pleased with our better-than-expected results in Q2, which benefited from a recurring travel demand, and also reflects the strong fundamentals of our business, a good execution by our teams. We remain confidence in the eventual full recovery of travel demand globally, and we're looking forward to a strong summer travel season this year in North America and Europe. We will continue to respond to invest in our business to ensure we're well-positioned for the full recovery of travel, and for building a larger and faster growing business generates more earnings than prior to the pandemic. We'll now take your questions. Maria, if you could open the lines for questions, please.\nOperator: Okay. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen. Your line is open.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks a lot. Could you talk more about key drivers of your competitive share gains that look like you're seeing in the U.S. And would you say growth in U.S over the past few months has been driven more by traditional hotel or more by alternative accommodation? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: So Kevin, why don't I take a little of this and let David add anything that he thinks I didn't put in that I should have said. So we are very pleased with the strong results that we're seeing in the U.S and that is a result of a lot of hard work by our team. A lot of it is just the blocking and tackling and making sure that we're getting the right inventory, the right price to the right marketing, presenting the right offer to the customer at the right time. And doing a bunch of things that we've been doing for so long in terms of improving conversion, a lot of AB testing, all the things we've always done, blocking and tackling. There's no silver bullet. There's no sense oh, this is the magic key to unlock extra demand in the U.S. It's just a lot of very good work. Now in terms of alternative accommodations, talked a little bit about how we're pleased to getting more inventory there. We're faced with gaining some share with some of our professional managers that's going well. But overall, it's everything that we do to improve our business provide a better service to both sides of that marketplace, both the customers given a paid offer and working with all of our suppliers from the biggest international chains to the small alternative accommodation and everything in between to make sure we're providing them with the demand they need to make their business successful. David anything specific you want to answer that?\nDavid Goulden: Oh, Glenn, I think you said it well, Just in response to your last part of the question, Kevin, as we said, our business in the U.S is more heavily mix to hotels alternatives than our global average. So therefore the growth rate has to be driven by both. We don't have levels of growth that we're seeing without seeing strong growth in the hotel business.\nKevin Kopelman: Yes, understood. Thanks, Glenn and thanks, David.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. Your line is open.\nMario Lu: Great, thanks for taking the question. As to on alternative accommodation, so I believe you mentioned you're gaining share on the manage properties globally. So can you provide some color onto what drove this share gain? Whether it was just mostly geo based, or specific actions that you guys made on your end? And then really, if you could share what percentage at the 6.6 million listings are actually managed properties versus by individual? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: I got a little backwards on that. So we don't disclose the breakdown of all the different categories of our alternative accommodations, how many are professionally managed, how many are single property owners and everything in between. I have said in the past and I'll repeat it that one of the areas that we do need to add more to is these single property owners. So we know that is an area that we need to focus on. In regards to your other questions about how we're doing adding care, I think we spoke a little bit about that. When I did the prepared remarks and when I just said now is a lot of this is just working hard with people are the property owners or the managers, people who have inventory that want to get it filled. It's a wonderful thing in this business that everybody knows an empty bed at night at zero revenue, you fill that bed, and you get an incredible margin on and they want to fill up their property. So we're there to make sure that they know we're there to help fill that into all things I mentioned before making sure that we can bring in that demand. I'll leave David, anything you want to disclose to them that is any different, I'm not sure if there's anything further to that.\nDavid Goulden: No, no additional data points on the mix of 6.6 million. What I just clarify, Mario, is that the comment that Glenn made about gaining share gains with a larger professional manager that's really related to how we're doing in the U.S. Now the specific U.S., like he point I'm not saying that's not the case worldwide. I'm just saying that if you remember, Australia's really get a lot of additional properties in the U.S with the target, more of the pressure managers where there's a lot of high quality supply available through those managers again, single property owner own properties that are available via managers. So the content we were making was there relative to what we're doing in the U.S.\nMario Lu: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Naved Khan from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nNaved Khan: Yes. Thanks a lot. A couple of questions. I think -- David, I think I heard you say marketing efficiency was higher versus 2019, and I did some rough math off of the bookings number. It does look -- it was higher in the last quarters. Can you just maybe talk about what are the drivers of efficiency in marketing? And then maybe one for Glenn. Maybe -- can you just talk about some reports of maybe flash deals being tested on the site maybe later this year? And what kind of interest you might be seeing from hotels in terms of participation?\nGlenn Fogel: So, David, do you want to take that first one?\nDavid Goulden: Yes, let me talk a little bit about marketing, what was going on. I think I understood the question. But basically what you see was in Q2 our marketing expense as a decline of our gross bookings, which is the way to look at it. Because if you look at it versus revenue, you\u2019ve got all the different books to say timing things in there. So look at some potential of our gross bookings. That ratio improved in the second quarter. So definitely, our marketing expenses declined more than our gross bookings did. Two factors, we do see higher ROIs across many of our paid channels that we store a couple years ago, but we also saw a nice increase in mixed awards direct as well. So the more you have direct mix analysis, then the less we're paying for marketing to attract those new customers. So I'd say, nothing particularly unique to fall out and that\u2019s the marketing environment that\u2019s still, I would say, isn't fully stable yet clearly. We are still going through a stage of recovery in the industry. So not all factors are directly comparable with where we were with 2019. But we were pleased to see that the ROI improved. Now bear in mind what I said about the Q3 implies that the opposite is likely to happen in Q3. Obviously, we're only a month into Q3. But we asked if we got a marketing spend in Q3 it is, historically the core, where we spend the most is the peak season. We want to recap the demand, the customers that are out there will also be increasing our spend -- brand spend in Q3 relative to Q2. So that's one of the contributors to essentially what will be some deleveraging marketing spend relative to gross bookings in Q3. So we'll see how the quarter develops, because that's what we expect to happen in the third quarter. But in the first two quarters, we did see that there is an ROI, helping us create some leverage on the marketing line.\nGlenn Fogel: And regarding your question about flash deals, if you read the same article that I did, I think there was something in there about there was no official response from Booking. So let me say that I have nothing to say specifically about this, but let me reemphasize that we are putting a lot of effort into working cooperatively with our supply partners to get the incremental demand through all different ways. Being a better merchandiser and providing more value to both sides of the marketplace, is where we're going.\nNaved Khan: Understood. Thank you, both.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Great. Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit about your experimentation with a more diversified marketing strategy. Historically, performance marketing has been the one that worked the best for the space. How should we think about your approach with some of the other channels? Are there specific kind of objectives that you look for kind of gravel comes back to leverage into those channels. And then the second question, kind of related to that, but how should we think about your market share during this time? I know it's sort of still early and there's not a lot of data points yet, but any color that you can provide on how your market share is trending in some of the markets where travel is recovering, that'd be great. Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: So regarding diversifying our marketing efforts, you are absolutely correctly, we built this company on doing a great, great job with performance marketing channels. So we know that. But what a lot of people don't know is that Priceline.com was very, very successful in its early days in brand marketing. And of course, we Booking.com, we brought the U.S., we have lots of brand marketing. The key thing in any type of marketing program is making sure that you're getting the ROI that you want to get. And we are going to continue to do that. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about how we are looking at new channels, like social channels, you've seen, I hope, some of the things that we've been putting out, we're going to continue to experiment and do all different ways to make sure we are reaching out for every pocket of demand. But we always do it with the knowledge that it's going to be cost effective. It's going to produce in the long run, because it takes longer for brand to actually produce results. So we recognize that, but in the long run, it's got to produce the results that we want. And we're going to keep on doing that. And I believe -- I really believe that in the long run, we will have many different ways that we're going to bring in marketing. One of the key things though, before you start spending a huge amount on a brand marketing campaign is making sure that you have the product the way you want it. And that's one of the things that we are keen to do and perhaps the alternative accommodations area is really working to make sure in the U.S., for example, that we've got that product the way we wanted. In regards to market shares, we're very pleased with how we're doing right now. I haven't seen results from some of our competitors. And I'm not really going to go down country by country in terms of what our shares are. But I am pleased with the results that we're achieving. I will let David say, if he wants to give any specificity.\nDavid Goulden: Glenn, I think you said well. We are pleased, we'll have to wait and see when the dust settles. I think market shares, better measure over the course of a year than a quarter or two quarters we're only two quarters into the year. But we're pleased with things with how things are going. Our growth rates relative to what we see happening out there. But we'll count that -- we will count that and talk about if we can more at the end of the year when we got some more concrete data on how the market actually developed.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Okay, thank you so much.\nOperator: And your next question will come from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great. A couple questions, I guess first, David, can you revisit your comment about July traveler bookings being better than summer of '19? And what that means for revenues in the third quarter? Any thoughts on that? And maybe, Glenn, you -- I think you said June was back to 13% from 2019. How does that make you feel about the confidence of a full travel recovery? And then when we do recover, maybe any high level thoughts on, could your market share be higher? Could your margins be higher than '19? Any new thoughts you have on either of those items would be really helpful? Thanks a lot.\nGlenn Fogel: All right [indiscernible].\nDavid Goulden: Yes, well, I'll start with just to kind of make sure that what we're saying. So to recalibrate or restate what we said, we have more gross bookings for the summer, for the remaining summer, then at the same time, in 2019, same time, I enjoyed 2019. Now we have that same time for Europe and North America. So assuming that cancellation rate stays the same, then that would potentially result in more revenue in those markets for the summer months for the remaining summer month. I did notice -- I did also point out that we will have -- that we have a high percentage of cancelable bookings out there or refundable bookings out there that we had at the same time in 2019 as well. So there's obviously some risks that more of those bookings cancelled than they were done in the same period of time. So it means basically that potential revenue base for the summer is higher now in those two markets than it was in 2019. Now, obviously, to offset that is what's happening in Europe -- sorry in Asia and what's happening in rest of world. We don't have a situation, the revenue or the bookings on the books, which will be potential revenue in those markets are substantially below where they were at the same time at the end of July in 2019.\nGlenn Fogel: Just I would say that nobody knows when this full recovery is going to happen. And I think everybody is able to throw a dart, but it's really throwing darts. Given all the variations that are happening, these new variants come out, we've seen the impact, there. The thing that I continue to say is how much we are very confident, I think everybody is that this will end at some point and we will come out of it strongly. Now, we've talked about this a bit in the past about how we want to come out of this, we want to have a bigger business, making more EBITDA, growing faster. But we've also talked a bit about margins, where we have a committee and we want to be a leader in the industry -- the leader in the industry. In terms of our margin, or EBITDA margin, but we recognize that a lot of things that we're doing nowadays can actually end up with a lower margin, obviously, air for example. I mean, it's wonderful when we say 120% increase over 2019 in air tickets, that\u2019s wonderful. But we all know, those margins are nowhere near what they are in the accommodation business, and I can go on at different examples. The key thing for us and for our shareholders, I believe, is coming back with more EBITDA doubts and contain to grow that fit our business, so there's more of that. That's the way we're looking at it.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nDae Lee: Hi, this is Dae Lee on for Doug. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Glenn. In your prepared remark you talked about better monetize the transaction flow and that's one of the drivers that led to the creation of this fintech. So just curious what\u2019s the opportunity that you're seeing there? Is this something that will affect user experience as well or more focused on the back end? And then second one for David, a follow-up question, on the sales and marketing ROI. You guys had called out higher ROIs last quarter and again this quarter. So I was curious if this is a result of something that you're doing differently, or is this just more on the outcome due to the competitive dynamic on the performance advertising channels?\nGlenn Fogel: So in terms of the fintech unit, there are many opportunities for us with a flow in 2019 a $100 billion worth of transaction flowing through there. We know that there are ways that we can save money for the consumers and the suppliers on both sides. And we can make good money on it too in the long run. So it's coming up with things like providing better FX tool. It's things for example, making sure that if somebody wants to pay an alternative payment method that we're able to provide that. It means making sure that we can do a better job with different types of regulations in terms of making sure that any type of transaction is not fraudulent. It's all sorts of things as a player in --- at scale, we can do things that many, many, many other partners with our partners could not do. And it's also providing conveniences to our customers who want it. But our suppliers can't do it on their own. And there are lots of different things that we can do. Even things as simple as our fintech unit setting something up, like our E-wallet, electronic wallet, that enables us to easily provide value to that customer, which can come from a supplier or it can be something that we're promoting ourselves, all different things. So what I see is not only the basics that we need to make our Connecting Trip work, which of course you have to have that if you want to create a Connected Trip with a single price point that one person pays one amount, but it's all the other types of things that we can provide that others really can't do on their own right now.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, and then on the second quarter ROIs, our playbook really has not changed. And our strategy and performance marketing channels have not changed. We continue to seek high quality traffic at the right price. And to us, high quality means high converting traffic, lower probability cancellation, which was recalculate a high probability of those coming back to us on a daily basis. And those are things that kind of go into our bidding strategy plus all the damage that occurred in each of those marketplaces. So we expect there'll be ROI volatility throughout the recovery. Of course, we also look at what the developer demand is and when there are time to get leading versus leading more. We are certainly looking at this as an opportunity to win customers onto our platform and get new customers and we mentioned a very healthy mix of new customers on -- in the business quite similar to nature as it was in feature '19. So we're pleased with how things are going. We like the way that we're bringing back existing customers. We like the way we're winning new customers. We are pleased to see the existing customers come back generally much more directly than the new customers, which you expect as part of the playbook. So I'd say many factors go into those ROI calculations, including cost per click conversion rates, cancellation rates, and we're still in a period of relatively high volatility in each of those compared to where we were in 2019.\nDae Lee: Got it. Thank you both.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nAlaxandar Wang: Hi, this is Alex Wong on for Brian. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions. One, I think you mentioned that your monthly traffic on Booking.com is backed about 90% of pre-pandemic, which is encouraging, particularly some of the headwinds, you're calling out in Asia. Just curious if we're able to segment out any differences in behavior on that new versus existing cohort and going forward any strategies to sort of grow those bases separately? Second question around air, like sounds like there's a lot of momentum there. Just curious on your views on some of the remaining execution hurdles you see for that initiative, and any plans to sort of grow consumer awareness for the new air product.\nGlenn Fogel: So I'll take the air first and we'll see what David wants to say or not say about breakup of our customer base. So, air, obviously, Priceline has been doing it forever, since the company started, but in the U.S only. And Booking.com only got going this very, very recently and I mentioned 24 countries nice, but that's a lot of countries that we haven't touched yet that has to be done. And there's so many things that need to be done to really prove the air part of it Booking.com, I'm not going to list them all. But I see a lot of ways we can make that even better than it is. And that's a little bit while we haven't done any real large marketing effort on the air side yet. We got to have to talk a little bit before we start really marketing. So make sure you got the product the way you want it. So it's so encouraging that we're doing well with it right now, even though I see a lot of things that still need to be done to improve that product. It's something that we're really pleased with is seeing the attachment rate again, and something that we obviously the reason they want to do this is not just to sell a flight ticket is to actually get some of those higher margin those accommodations and build out that Connected Trip. So it's nice to see at a very early stage. And I urge you to say, listen, Kevin, I think very early stage, we're seeing good results. So I do see a lot of opportunity here in the future. But we won't be bringing out any sort of marketing on it until I feel that we have the product where we want it to be. And David, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk about the other one.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, there's a lot more to say. I think we wanted to help, we will give you some data points to understand how our active customers by people are actually actively booking on the site have recovered. And the mix -- a healthy mix of new customers only slightly below what we saw in Q2 '19. I think those are good signs. So I don't want to get into the segmentation with our customers. Obviously, there are some customers who book very often, some customers took book wise much and we love them all. But we will make sure we can treat them differently. And I say that's part of the reason why we have a Genius program. Of course, the more often you work with us or book for us on Booking.com I move up the Genius ladder and you get more benefits from the Genius program, which is I think a nice way of driving loyalty. So other than the data points we've given out before, which we thought would just be helpful, stating the grounds people understand what's going on within the business. I don't want to get into a further details.\nAlaxandar Wang: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Mark Mahaney from Evercore. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Hey, thanks. I guess, I'll just follow-up on the -- keep sticking with the air and I guess learnings to date and talk about this is -- is this a new customer acquisition tool? Is this a cross-sell product? You notice greater engagement with the people in those 24 markets were you brought to that with booking. This has increased the overall spend, frequency of purchase. Well, what have you seen so far, and maybe it's all too early. So I guess if you're going to respond that way, then I'll ask when do you think you'll have a decent read and to what impact if any permanent -- if it's had a permanent impact on your Booking com customer base? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Mark. So [indiscernible] just on what you said like too early, but I will add a little bit more -- I will add a little more to that. In a sense, I'm very pleased because we haven't been out really marking this yet. new customers are coming to the site, and then we're seeing them get a attractive cross-sell that I really like seeing that as a sign that this is the right direction that we're going in now. I had a good sense that was going to happen anyway, because we've been seeing that happen in Priceline for two decades where that's been happening. So I had good confidence that this would happen. But it's something that I believe we want to have a lot more data before we start coming back, U.S start showing you, here's what attachment rates are heroes, it compares to price lines, here's what we see versus industry and how many new people are coming from the air funnel versus the others, I would just leave everyone with the sense that we're very pleased. This is bringing us new customers, new customers who are buying not just flight tickets, but some of them are buying hotels, too. This is proving out a little bit of our long-term vision on this Connected Trip. Now, do I expect that to happen with something like activities? No, I'm not really think a lot of people are going to come for an activity first, then they're going to buy a flight or then they're going to buy a hotel. It's -- that's going to be a lot more the other way and helping produce the loyalty and the repeat business that we talked about. And then goes into all the things I was talking about in terms of using a wallet so we can get credits. Now, different suppliers, be able to promote different offerings in different ways to different customers, all that spins together, increasing that flywheel. And that's what we're trying to achieve, and it's just so great to see it start happening right now, even though it's very early.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, thanks, Glenn.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nVince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about your perspective on leisure versus corporate. I believe you historically see about 80% of the business in leisure. So first there, some markets are running 15%, 20% ahead of '19 levels. And I'm curious your perspective on the long-term trend line within leisure and how COVID has changed that maybe people's ability to work remote. You mentioned more leisure business shifting online with that McKinsey study. But just curious how you think about leisure over the long run. And then the second part is on the corporate side, any early indications of recovery there and how you think that evolved through the second half of this year?\nGlenn Fogel: Yes, let me give a generalities about what I think about leader versus business and the purpose general what I think is going to be happening in the future. And David, go back and talk about what we've disclosed in the past about the mix. So I think you're right, in the sense that we are much more leisure oriented, and much of our business travel is small business people, these are people who are doing their own travel, this is not part of the big travel management company operation. So it's a little bit differently when we have business travelers and they act somewhat similar to leisure sometimes. The fact is, we've all seen is that leisure is out of the gate much faster than any business travel, which makes perfect sense. Because on the one hand, you have business people who say there's a risk factor when you put people in travel, etcetera. There's also the issue of costs. Why have people travel? You don't have to,. That second part, I think is very key for the future of the business. I believe that there's still going to be resistance by CFOs, now the people who are cost conscious in their businesses about do we really have to have all the travel we did in the past? Maybe not. Because with these new technologies, what we seem to be pretty effective without having to send somebody from New York to London and $15,000 for a one day meeting. I think that's going to somewhat change how the business of travel is done. There'll be fewer people up front in the plane, and spending a lot of money in those very high cost five star hotels, etcetera, which will change things a little bit. For us, we're leisure so it's not going to impact us negatively so much. In fact, they help us because there's more availability that needs to get filled up. The other thing you mentioned, though, was the NCR plays out though, with more people being able to work-from-home and deciding [indiscernible], I think Friday, I'm going to work from somewhere else and have a Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, mini holiday somewhere working Thursday, Friday, but at different location. How much is that going to actually build more travel? Uncertain at this time since everybody is still shifting around? What the way to work in the future? How many days are we in offices? How many days are we not in office? Nobody knows the answer to that yet. It's going to take a long time to play out. But I do hope that we'll hopefully build out more travel, we like more travel. So there's a lot of uncertainty about this and nobody really knows And even as much as I've heard the encouraging signs from some of the suppliers to some of the airlines, I saw a Deloitte report came out a couple of days ago, maybe yesterday in which the expectation of corporate travel was not as optimistic in the near-term. So I think we'd have to say, we don't know, we'll find out as it rolls out. And David, I don\u2019t know if you want to give anything more than that in terms of the numbers for us in business trial, because I heard a now where he quoted, I'm not sure those are right or not.\nDavid Goulden: No the number. First of all we have given recently, but we're over 88% leisure. And as we said, our business, first of all, it's a self declared metric when you make a booking, so it's hard to be precise about it. But the type of business travel we do have is much more unknown business travelers, Glenn explained. So we're heavily biased towards that larger segments.\nVince Ciepiel: Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nJed Kelly: Great, great. Thanks for taking my question. Two, if I may. Just as you sort of you mentioned earlier in your prepared remarks that you're gaining share with professional property managers. Can you sort of talk about like your supply strategy, heading into this winter in the U.S., trying to increase that single unit inventory? And then, can you give us an update just on how APAC is trending, particularly with the Gouda. Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: So I will let David talk what you say about Asia in general. And regarding this year, I just want to be a little careful. We said we were pleased with that we are doing better, we're gaining. We're gaining share with the professional managers. And I like what we're seeing there. It's going to be a long haul in terms of building out the U.S inventory for all types of alternative accommodations, whether it be professionally managed, getting as many as you want there or single property is going to be a while to get to where we want to be in that. I understand that this is a goal that we're working on hard by having boots on the ground, talking to managers, sending out the right information, getting people to understand why we have a great proposition for them. And I'm confident we're going to do that. When you look at what we've achieved in Europe, you look at the share of our alternative accommodations in Europe, you say, boy, that's a goal to have in the U.S., too. We should be pushing for that. There's no reason we should. Customers are similar. The proposition is similar. There's nothing that we shouldn't be -- the reason we shouldn't be able to achieve that over time. But it's going to take time. David, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk about Asia a little bit there?\nDavid Goulden: Yes, so Asia, APAC, I mentioned that the room night growth was worse in Q2 than it was in Q1. So that really deteriorated to counteract some of the benefits and frankly, saw in the Europe and North America, of course, both puffy and Agoda cyber businesses in APAC, although clearly that's the majority of Agoda's. So the whole region is very depressed as you know. Vaccination rates are lagging in most parts of Asia. Also, response to COVID outbreaks tend to be more aggressive. And restrictions are put in place more quickly, based upon outbreaks in the Asia region across almost all countries. So travel level is very low, particularly in international travel levels exceptionally low, and still a long way to go. No recovery in Q2, in fact, worse in Q2, this Q1.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes our Q&A. I will turn the call over back to Glenn Fogel for closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. So in closing, I want to reiterate our strong belief that our industry's full recovery will be hastened by everyone who can get a vaccine going out and getting it. We urge all people who are approved for a medically able to be vaccinated, to do their part to make our society safer and go out and get a vaccine. And as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders, we appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you and please be safe. Good night.\nOperator: And that concludes our conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the second quarter and provide some color on trends we've seen so far in the third quarter. To avoid comparison to pandemic impacted periods in 2020, all growth rates will be relative to comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the second quarter. On our last earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends in Q1 which continued into April, driven by strong results in the U.S and improvements in Europe. On the earnings call, we saw the overall improvements in our trends accelerate in May and continue to get better in June, which resulted in our Q2 reported room nights declining 26% versus Q2 2019, which was significantly ahead of the 54% decline in Q1, a 43% decline we saw in April and our expectations in May. The improvement in Q2 room nights growth rate versus Q1 was driven by Europe and the U.S as well as better results in rest of world. Europe showed the greatest level of recovery in the quarter and actually achieved slight room night growth versus 2019 in June. Booking trends in Europe clearly benefited from a notable improvement in vaccination rates, as well as loosening travel restrictions. The U.S was again the strongest performing major country in Q2, and have very strong room night growth versus 2019 for the full quarter. Asia partially offset improvements in other regions with greater room night declines in Q2 than in Q1, due to the increase in COVID outbreaks with related travel restrictions. In the month of June, our room nights were down 13% and our monthly active unique customer accounts at Booking.com reached about 90% of the level we saw in June 2019. As Glenn mentioned, we are pleased to see the solid rebound in our customer base of Booking.com as well as a healthy mix of new customers, which is only a little lower than the mix of new customers in Q2 2019. Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, represented over 60% of our total room nights. Our app continues to represent an increased percentage of our mobile bookings. Our direct channel increased as a percentage of room nights year-on-year and relative to Q2 2019. Domestic room nights grew in the mid teens in Q2, while international room nights remained down significantly versus 2019, we saw a sequential improvement in our international bookings resulting in the international mix of our room nights increasing to about 25% in Q2 from about 15% in Q1. Our cancellation rates improved from Q1 and were in line with Q2 2019 levels in the quarter. The percentage of our Q2 2021 bookings made with flexible cancellation policies remain significant higher than in Q2 2019. The booking window Booking.com remained shorter than it was in the second quarter of 2019 as we continue to see a higher mix of near-term bookings. However, the booking window contract is less than it did in the prior three quarters. The mix of alternative accommodation room nights on Booking.com in Q2 was 32%, which is three points higher than Q1. In June, our alternative accommodation room night growth was flat versus June 2019, the first time we've reached 2019 levels for this segment since the start of COVID. The sequential improvement from Q1 to Q2 was due primarily to the overall improvements in room night growth in Europe in the quarter. As we noted, last quarter, Europe is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodation remained about the same as Q1, this represents a continued increase from 2019 to 2020 and in to2021. Gross bookings declined 12% in Q2, which is less than the decline in reported room nights, due to an increase in average day rates for accommodations of a 11% versus 2019 on a constant currency basis, and also due to a few points of changes in FX rates and strong performance in our flights business. Our accommodation constant currency ADR benefited by about 7% from an increased mix of business in North America, which is the high ADR region and a decrease of mix of business in Asia, which is a lower ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADR was up approximately 4%, driven mainly by rate increases in North America and in Europe. The increase in North America were driven by high levels of demand for beach oriented leisure destinations. And in Europe were driven by a higher mix of summer bookings which have higher ADRs. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up 120% versus 2019, driven by strong growth of Priceline and by flight bookings of Booking.com and Agoda, neither of which have flight products in Q2 2019. We are encouraged to see another record breaking quarter for air tickets booked for our flights business, which is a key component of a multiproduct Connected Trip strategy. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $2.2 billion and decreased 44% versus 2019, which is better than our expectations. Revenue in the quarter declined meaningfully more than gross bookings due to bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check-in in future quarters at which point the revenue will be recognized. Take rates in Q2 were about 10%, largely driven by these timing differences. As you will recall, we discussed the impact of timing on take rates in Q1, Q2 and for the full year during our last call. We continue to expect these timing factors to impact full year take rates, although the second half of the year will be less notably impacted than the first half of the year. Removing the impact of timing, our take rates on accommodation bookings in Q2 were stable versus Q2 2019. The better-than-expected top line performance resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $48 million in the second quarter, which came in better than our expectations. With the exception of Q3 last year, this is the first EBITDA positive quarter since the first wave of COVID. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line decreased 29% versus 2019. Marketing expense declined more than gross bookings due to higher ROIs in the paid channels and the increase in our direct mix. Sales and other expenses in Q2 were significantly higher than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis. Sales and other expenses has a percentage of revenue in Q2 with better than our expectations due to lower-than-expected by debt and customer service related expenses. Personnel expenses in Q2 were higher than they were in Q1 on a dollar basis, primarily due to the $136 million expenses related to our decision to repay the government aid in the second quarter. Excluding this repayments, personnel expenses in Q2 would have been in line with our expectations. G&A and IT expenses were both higher in Q2 than it were in Q1 on a dollar basis, and we're in line with our expectations. We recorded a non-GAAP loss of $105 million in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we have an operating loss of $56 million in Q2. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $167 million in the quarter, which includes income tax expense of $146 million. On a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, in Q2, we recorded a tax expense on a pre-tax loss due to higher earnings expectations for the full year relative to our expectations for Q1. For the full year, we expect on GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly higher than in 2019. Now onto our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $16.1 billion was down versus our Q1 ending balance of $16.4 billion. However, our Q1 ending balance benefited from the timing of the $2 billion raised in our euro bond offering which we completed in March and the subsequent redemption of the two higher coupon senior notes occurring in April. Adjusting our Q1 ending cash balance for the redemption of the two notes that happened in April would have resulted in an adjusted Q1 cash balance of $14.4 billion. Our Q2 ending balance was higher than this adjusted Q1 balance primarily due to operating cash flow of $1.2 billion and a $0.5 billion unrealized gain on long-term investments. $0.2 billion of operating cash flow in the quarter was driven almost entirely by change in working capital. Change in working capital represented source of cash of $1.2 billion in the quarter due to the increase in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities, partially offset by the increase in our accounts receivable. We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position given the continued uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. Of the $16.1 billion of cash and investments at the end of Q2, $4.3 billion was related to our long-term strategic investments, and $11.7 billion was cash and short-term investments. We ended the quarter with about $12.3 billion in debt, which is about $3.6 billion higher than our pre-pandemic levels. We have a 1 billion convertible note maturing in Q3. While return of capital to shareholders will be an important component of our value creation strategy in the future, we remain on pause and we will wait to reinitiate and so we believe each of our three major regions is beyond the risk of a significant reversal in trends due to COVID. We're not there yet, given the current trends we're seeing in Asia and with our current close watch on how things are developing in Europe. Now on to our thoughts for the third quarter. With the recent rising case counts driven by Delta -- by the Delta variant in many countries, some governments around the world have responded with new travel and leisure restrictions as well as some stricter vaccination and testing requirements for tourists. However, there are indications that hospitalization rates are lagging the recent increases in case counts, particularly in countries with high vaccination rates, which could be an important factor in how governments plan their responses to the recent increase in COVID cases. We're closely watching the U.K where the vaccination rate is high, and the government's move forward with relaxing travel restrictions despite rising case counts in the country, which are among the highest in Europe. We are encouraged by the recent decline in new case counts and by the continued low level of hospitalizations in the U.K compared with other outbreaks. We saw booking trends improved in the U.K in July, leading up to an after travel restrictions lifted on July 8 -- on July 19.  Our July room nights declined about 22% versus 2019, which was a modest pullback from the 13% decline in June, family just softening booking trends in Europe. Looking within Europe, we saw a reduction to room nights in July across several of our key countries including Germany, France and Italy. But despite the recent pullback in these countries at the end of July, we had a high amount of gross bookings on the books for the remaining summer period in Europe than we did this same point in time in 2019. Outside of Europe, the U.S continued to have very strong room night growth in July, although modestly below Q2 levels. While Asia and rest of world room night declined for about the same in July as it were in June. Asia continues to be the least recovered region in July and continues to be down significantly from 2019 levels. The changing growth rates from June to July were similar for domestic and international room nights with domestic remaining positive and international room nights remaining down significantly versus 2019. Given the recent additional uncertainty around COVID, driven primarily by the Delta variant, it's difficult to predict exactly how room nights in August and September will compare with a 22% reduction we saw in July. Turning to the income statement. We expect Q3 gross bookings to decline several points less than room nights, driven by expected improvements in reported areas and my flight bookings. We expect that the Q3 revenue decline will significantly improve from Q2 reflecting the strong improvement in bookings in the last few months. I just mentioned we have more gross bookings for the summer than at this time in 2019 for Europe. The same is also true for North America. We expect our Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings will increase meaningfully from Q2 due to the high concentration of checkings expected in the third quarter and will be about in line with Q3 2019. As a reminder, the exact relationship between revenue and gross bookings in Q3 will be impacted by how our bookings trend in August and September. We expect marketing expenses in Q3 will decline several points less than gross bookings, as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the peak travel season and ahead of the continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect sales and other expenses in Q3 to be up significantly versus Q2 on dollar basis due to higher gross booking volumes in the third quarter as well as a mix -- as well as an increase in the mix of gross bookings process on a merchant basis. However, we expect sales and other as a percentage of revenue in Q3 will be a bit lower than in future. We expect our more fixed expense categories in Q3 in aggregate to be about in line with Q2 on a $1 basis. We expect Q3 EBITDA will be the highest since Q3 2019. In conclusion, we have pleased with our better-than-expected results in Q2, which benefited from a recurring travel demand, and also reflects the strong fundamentals of our business, a good execution by our teams. We remain confidence in the eventual full recovery of travel demand globally, and we're looking forward to a strong summer travel season this year in North America and Europe. We will continue to respond to invest in our business to ensure we're well-positioned for the full recovery of travel, and for building a larger and faster growing business generates more earnings than prior to the pandemic. We'll now take your questions. Maria, if you could open the lines for questions, please. Oh, Glenn, I think you said it well, Just in response to your last part of the question, Kevin, as we said, our business in the U.S is more heavily mix to hotels alternatives than our global average. So therefore the growth rate has to be driven by both. We don't have levels of growth that we're seeing without seeing strong growth in the hotel business. No, no additional data points on the mix of 6.6 million. What I just clarify, Mario, is that the comment that Glenn made about gaining share gains with a larger professional manager that's really related to how we're doing in the U.S. Now the specific U.S., like he point I'm not saying that's not the case worldwide. I'm just saying that if you remember, Australia's really get a lot of additional properties in the U.S with the target, more of the pressure managers where there's a lot of high quality supply available through those managers again, single property owner own properties that are available via managers. So the content we were making was there relative to what we're doing in the U.S. Yes, let me talk a little bit about marketing, what was going on. I think I understood the question. But basically what you see was in Q2 our marketing expense as a decline of our gross bookings, which is the way to look at it. Because if you look at it versus revenue, you've got all the different books to say timing things in there. So look at some potential of our gross bookings. That ratio improved in the second quarter. So definitely, our marketing expenses declined more than our gross bookings did. Two factors, we do see higher ROIs across many of our paid channels that we store a couple years ago, but we also saw a nice increase in mixed awards direct as well. So the more you have direct mix analysis, then the less we're paying for marketing to attract those new customers. So I'd say, nothing particularly unique to fall out and that's the marketing environment that's still, I would say, isn't fully stable yet clearly. We are still going through a stage of recovery in the industry. So not all factors are directly comparable with where we were with 2019. But we were pleased to see that the ROI improved. Now bear in mind what I said about the Q3 implies that the opposite is likely to happen in Q3. Obviously, we're only a month into Q3. But we asked if we got a marketing spend in Q3 it is, historically the core, where we spend the most is the peak season. We want to recap the demand, the customers that are out there will also be increasing our spend -- brand spend in Q3 relative to Q2. So that's one of the contributors to essentially what will be some deleveraging marketing spend relative to gross bookings in Q3. So we'll see how the quarter develops, because that's what we expect to happen in the third quarter. But in the first two quarters, we did see that there is an ROI, helping us create some leverage on the marketing line. Glenn, I think you said well. We are pleased, we'll have to wait and see when the dust settles. I think market shares, better measure over the course of a year than a quarter or two quarters we're only two quarters into the year. But we're pleased with things with how things are going. Our growth rates relative to what we see happening out there. But we'll count that -- we will count that and talk about if we can more at the end of the year when we got some more concrete data on how the market actually developed. Yes, well, I'll start with just to kind of make sure that what we're saying. So to recalibrate or restate what we said, we have more gross bookings for the summer, for the remaining summer, then at the same time, in 2019, same time, I enjoyed 2019. Now we have that same time for Europe and North America. So assuming that cancellation rate stays the same, then that would potentially result in more revenue in those markets for the summer months for the remaining summer month. I did notice -- I did also point out that we will have -- that we have a high percentage of cancelable bookings out there or refundable bookings out there that we had at the same time in 2019 as well. So there's obviously some risks that more of those bookings cancelled than they were done in the same period of time. So it means basically that potential revenue base for the summer is higher now in those two markets than it was in 2019. Now, obviously, to offset that is what's happening in Europe -- sorry in Asia and what's happening in rest of world. We don't have a situation, the revenue or the bookings on the books, which will be potential revenue in those markets are substantially below where they were at the same time at the end of July in 2019. Yes, and then on the second quarter ROIs, our playbook really has not changed. And our strategy and performance marketing channels have not changed. We continue to seek high quality traffic at the right price. And to us, high quality means high converting traffic, lower probability cancellation, which was recalculate a high probability of those coming back to us on a daily basis. And those are things that kind of go into our bidding strategy plus all the damage that occurred in each of those marketplaces. So we expect there'll be ROI volatility throughout the recovery. Of course, we also look at what the developer demand is and when there are time to get leading versus leading more. We are certainly looking at this as an opportunity to win customers onto our platform and get new customers and we mentioned a very healthy mix of new customers on -- in the business quite similar to nature as it was in feature '19. So we're pleased with how things are going. We like the way that we're bringing back existing customers. We like the way we're winning new customers. We are pleased to see the existing customers come back generally much more directly than the new customers, which you expect as part of the playbook. So I'd say many factors go into those ROI calculations, including cost per click conversion rates, cancellation rates, and we're still in a period of relatively high volatility in each of those compared to where we were in 2019. Yes, there's a lot more to say. I think we wanted to help, we will give you some data points to understand how our active customers by people are actually actively booking on the site have recovered. And the mix -- a healthy mix of new customers only slightly below what we saw in Q2 '19. I think those are good signs. So I don't want to get into the segmentation with our customers. Obviously, there are some customers who book very often, some customers took book wise much and we love them all. But we will make sure we can treat them differently. And I say that's part of the reason why we have a Genius program. Of course, the more often you work with us or book for us on Booking.com I move up the Genius ladder and you get more benefits from the Genius program, which is I think a nice way of driving loyalty. So other than the data points we've given out before, which we thought would just be helpful, stating the grounds people understand what's going on within the business. I don't want to get into a further details. No the number. First of all we have given recently, but we're over 88% leisure. And as we said, our business, first of all, it's a self declared metric when you make a booking, so it's hard to be precise about it. But the type of business travel we do have is much more unknown business travelers, Glenn explained. So we're heavily biased towards that larger segments. Yes, so Asia, APAC, I mentioned that the room night growth was worse in Q2 than it was in Q1. So that really deteriorated to counteract some of the benefits and frankly, saw in the Europe and North America, of course, both puffy and Agoda cyber businesses in APAC, although clearly that's the majority of Agoda's. So the whole region is very depressed as you know. Vaccination rates are lagging in most parts of Asia. Also, response to COVID outbreaks tend to be more aggressive. And restrictions are put in place more quickly, based upon outbreaks in the Asia region across almost all countries. So travel level is very low, particularly in international travel levels exceptionally low, and still a long way to go. No recovery in Q2, in fact, worse in Q2, this Q1."

            "content": "Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I'm encouraged by another quarter of meaningful improvement in our accommodations business with Q2 room nights up sequentially 59% versus Q1. This compares very favorably to our pre-pandemic historical pattern of a slight decline in Q2 room nights versus Q1. Compared with 2019, Q2 room nights were down 26%, which was significantly better than the 43% decline we previously reported for the month of April and a 54% decline in Q1. The acceleration in the second quarter was primarily driven by domestic and international booking trends in Europe, following a ramp up in vaccination rates and the relaxation of many travel restrictions in the region. Good growth of international bookings in Europe was mainly from bookings within the European region. The very strong room night growth in the United States that we saw in April and highlighted on our last earnings call continued in May and June, resulting in very strong US room night growth for the full quarter versus Q2 2019. David will provide additional details on our second quarter results in his remarks. We are, of course, closely monitoring the impact of the Delta variant on the rising COVID case counts around the world as well as some newly imposed travel restrictions, which have led to a modest pullback in our booking trends in the month of July relative to June. However, the July booking trends were improved from our full Q2 results. While the rise of the Delta variant demonstrates the volatility and uncertainty around the exact timing and shape of the recovery for travel, we remain confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. The sharp return to growth initially in the U.S and then in the European markets that we have witnessed this year shows us clearly that leisure travelers are eager to get back to booking trips on our platform when restrictions are lifted and customers are able to travel. We expect to be much closer to our 2019 revenue levels in Q3 than we were in Q2, driven by the strong booking improvements we have seen in the last few months. As we've done throughout the pandemic, we will continue to build on the strengths of our poor accommodation business and support its long-term growth. The strength of our core business comes from the flywheel effect we get from our two sided marketplace where we drive benefits to our traveler customers and our supply partners alike. For our customers, we strive to deliver the best choice of accommodations offer the most value and provide the easiest booking experience, all backed by excellent customer service and support. By addressing these critical needs of choice, value and ease, we create a superior booking experience and strengthen the relationships with our customers. I'm pleased to report that at Booking.com we are seeing pre-pandemic customers coming back to us to book their trips, while also attracting new customers. And the current mix of prior and new customers is not significantly different than prior to the pandemic. One of the ways we drive value to our large customer base at Booking.com is through our Genius Loyalty program. This program provides discounts for Genius members at hundreds of thousands of properties on our platform, and also offers value and other benefits like complimentary breakfast, free room upgrades, and more recently, discounted airport taxes just to name a few. We will continue innovating and adding to the ways we provide value to our Genius customers who have historically had a higher repeat rate and a higher mix of direct bookings when compared to non-Genius customers. Our app is an important way we deliver an easier booking experience to our customers. Globally, in Q2, Booking.com was the number one downloaded OTA app according to a third-party research firm. In the U.S., in Q2, we were the most downloaded major OTA app as downloads of Booking.com app in the second quarter significantly increased sequentially. We also saw U.S app user in Q2 meaningfully surpassed the prior peak observed before the COVID pandemic. In the second quarter, we again saw a higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in the comparable period in 2019. It is encouraging to see these gains even as we look for opportunities to lean into performance marketing channels, where we see attractive ROIs. We have a long history of effectively managing our performance marketing channels to bring bookers to our platform profitably. We plan to continue with this proven approach in the future. In addition, we're leveraging our marketing expertise and ROI focus as we test into other channels like social and digital media, as well as when we deploy promotional campaigns like our Back to Travel campaign, which we ran first in the U.S and then launched in the U.K and across Europe. We will continue to expand the diversity of our marketing and customer acquisition channels as we aim to drive incremental traffic to our platform and increase consumer awareness of our brands. While we will remain focused on our efforts to grow and retain our customer base, we believe we will continue to benefit from the secular tailwind of more people booking their trips online instead of offline. Historically, the accommodation industry has seen a steady increase in online share each year. And looking ahead, we believe this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. In April, McKinsey published a 24 country survey with results showing that across 11 major consumer facing industries, travel had the greatest percentage of customers that plan to increase their usage of digital channels after the pandemic. On the other side of our marketplace, we are focused on helping our supply partners reach a broader audience of potential customers. Our scale and global reach allows us to connect our supply partners with a significant amount of demand from around the world, demonstrated by the 845 million room nights booked across our platforms in 2019. In addition to being a large demand channel for our partners, we add value to our accommodation partners in other ways by providing customer service support for travelers in over 40 languages, localized partner service support teams, market intelligence and data, product innovations in response to new traveler trends and fraud liability shift and access to alternative payment methods for payment enabled transactions. With an alternative accommodation or independent hotel, or a large global hotel chain, we strive to be a valuable partner to all types of accommodations on our platform. In the second quarter, we saw the first sequential increase in the number of properties on Booking.com and the lowest number of properties coming off of our platform in the quarter since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, we had over 28 million reported listings on Booking.com, of which 6.6 million were for alternative accommodation properties. Within alternative accommodations in the U.S., Booking.com continue to add targeted new properties in the corner, and also saw encouraging share gains with some of our larger professional managers. While these are positive early developments, we recognize there is much work ahead to improve and grow our alternative accommodations product in the U.S market. Our alternative accommodations business in Europe was strong in the quarter and represented an increasing share of our European accommodations business. I want to move to our key strategic priorities of expanding Booking.com's payment platform and building the Connected Trip vision, both of which we believe will further enhance the strength of our core accommodation business and support its continued growth. On our integrated payment platform at Booking.com, we have made continued progress with increasing the adoption of payments by our supply partners in the U.S., including adding some major hotel chains in the second quarter. Around 24% of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q2 were processed through its payment platform, which is up from about 22% for the full year 2020. We recently announced the organization of all of our payments initiatives and efforts into a new fintech unit at Booking.com. First, the fintech unit will be focused on enabling bookings core business to run better, faster and more efficiently for both customers and our supply partners. In addition, we recognize that we have opportunities to better monetize our overall transaction flows. In 2019, we did almost $100 billion of transaction value, and we believe setting up a separate fintech unit to better capitalize on these flows will benefit us in the long run. On our Connected Trip vision, I mentioned on our last earnings call that the development of the Connected Trip this year will be focused on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. The top priority of this -- on this front has been to scale up a robust flight platform on Booking.com, which will give us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey, and allow us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. Since our last earnings call, we have launched our flight product in six new markets, and now alive in 24 countries. In air tickets booked through bookings flight offering have continued to meaningfully exceed our expectations. However, these still represented a small portion of our total reported air tickets, which were up 120% in Q2 versus Q2 2019, primarily this is driven by Priceline. While it remains early days for Booking's flight product, we are seeing positive data indicating we are getting entirely new customers for Booking.com. In addition, we are seeing an encouraging attach rate of a combination bookings from these new customers. These early data points help demonstrate that our flight offering creates a new funnel to bring incremental customers to the platform, and then cross-sell an accommodation to these new customers. We expect to continue to build on the early success we are seeing with flight at Booking.com. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in some parts of the world. And I'm confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally. We continue with our most important work to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. And our teams are working hard to support the strong summer travel season this year in North America and Europe. As I said before, we are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. And we are focused on building a larger and faster growing business to generate more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David? So Kevin, why don't I take a little of this and let David add anything that he thinks I didn't put in that I should have said. So we are very pleased with the strong results that we're seeing in the U.S and that is a result of a lot of hard work by our team. A lot of it is just the blocking and tackling and making sure that we're getting the right inventory, the right price to the right marketing, presenting the right offer to the customer at the right time. And doing a bunch of things that we've been doing for so long in terms of improving conversion, a lot of AB testing, all the things we've always done, blocking and tackling. There's no silver bullet. There's no sense oh, this is the magic key to unlock extra demand in the U.S. It's just a lot of very good work. Now in terms of alternative accommodations, talked a little bit about how we're pleased to getting more inventory there. We're faced with gaining some share with some of our professional managers that's going well. But overall, it's everything that we do to improve our business provide a better service to both sides of that marketplace, both the customers given a paid offer and working with all of our suppliers from the biggest international chains to the small alternative accommodation and everything in between to make sure we're providing them with the demand they need to make their business successful. David anything specific you want to answer that? I got a little backwards on that. So we don't disclose the breakdown of all the different categories of our alternative accommodations, how many are professionally managed, how many are single property owners and everything in between. I have said in the past and I'll repeat it that one of the areas that we do need to add more to is these single property owners. So we know that is an area that we need to focus on. In regards to your other questions about how we're doing adding care, I think we spoke a little bit about that. When I did the prepared remarks and when I just said now is a lot of this is just working hard with people are the property owners or the managers, people who have inventory that want to get it filled. It's a wonderful thing in this business that everybody knows an empty bed at night at zero revenue, you fill that bed, and you get an incredible margin on and they want to fill up their property. So we're there to make sure that they know we're there to help fill that into all things I mentioned before making sure that we can bring in that demand. I'll leave David, anything you want to disclose to them that is any different, I'm not sure if there's anything further to that. So, David, do you want to take that first one? And regarding your question about flash deals, if you read the same article that I did, I think there was something in there about there was no official response from Booking. So let me say that I have nothing to say specifically about this, but let me reemphasize that we are putting a lot of effort into working cooperatively with our supply partners to get the incremental demand through all different ways. Being a better merchandiser and providing more value to both sides of the marketplace, is where we're going. So regarding diversifying our marketing efforts, you are absolutely correctly, we built this company on doing a great, great job with performance marketing channels. So we know that. But what a lot of people don't know is that Priceline.com was very, very successful in its early days in brand marketing. And of course, we Booking.com, we brought the U.S., we have lots of brand marketing. The key thing in any type of marketing program is making sure that you're getting the ROI that you want to get. And we are going to continue to do that. I mentioned in my prepared remarks about how we are looking at new channels, like social channels, you've seen, I hope, some of the things that we've been putting out, we're going to continue to experiment and do all different ways to make sure we are reaching out for every pocket of demand. But we always do it with the knowledge that it's going to be cost effective. It's going to produce in the long run, because it takes longer for brand to actually produce results. So we recognize that, but in the long run, it's got to produce the results that we want. And we're going to keep on doing that. And I believe -- I really believe that in the long run, we will have many different ways that we're going to bring in marketing. One of the key things though, before you start spending a huge amount on a brand marketing campaign is making sure that you have the product the way you want it. And that's one of the things that we are keen to do and perhaps the alternative accommodations area is really working to make sure in the U.S., for example, that we've got that product the way we wanted. In regards to market shares, we're very pleased with how we're doing right now. I haven't seen results from some of our competitors. And I'm not really going to go down country by country in terms of what our shares are. But I am pleased with the results that we're achieving. I will let David say, if he wants to give any specificity. All right [indiscernible]. Just I would say that nobody knows when this full recovery is going to happen. And I think everybody is able to throw a dart, but it's really throwing darts. Given all the variations that are happening, these new variants come out, we've seen the impact, there. The thing that I continue to say is how much we are very confident, I think everybody is that this will end at some point and we will come out of it strongly. Now, we've talked about this a bit in the past about how we want to come out of this, we want to have a bigger business, making more EBITDA, growing faster. But we've also talked a bit about margins, where we have a committee and we want to be a leader in the industry -- the leader in the industry. In terms of our margin, or EBITDA margin, but we recognize that a lot of things that we're doing nowadays can actually end up with a lower margin, obviously, air for example. I mean, it's wonderful when we say 120% increase over 2019 in air tickets, that's wonderful. But we all know, those margins are nowhere near what they are in the accommodation business, and I can go on at different examples. The key thing for us and for our shareholders, I believe, is coming back with more EBITDA doubts and contain to grow that fit our business, so there's more of that. That's the way we're looking at it. So in terms of the fintech unit, there are many opportunities for us with a flow in 2019 a $100 billion worth of transaction flowing through there. We know that there are ways that we can save money for the consumers and the suppliers on both sides. And we can make good money on it too in the long run. So it's coming up with things like providing better FX tool. It's things for example, making sure that if somebody wants to pay an alternative payment method that we're able to provide that. It means making sure that we can do a better job with different types of regulations in terms of making sure that any type of transaction is not fraudulent. It's all sorts of things as a player in --- at scale, we can do things that many, many, many other partners with our partners could not do. And it's also providing conveniences to our customers who want it. But our suppliers can't do it on their own. And there are lots of different things that we can do. Even things as simple as our fintech unit setting something up, like our E-wallet, electronic wallet, that enables us to easily provide value to that customer, which can come from a supplier or it can be something that we're promoting ourselves, all different things. So what I see is not only the basics that we need to make our Connecting Trip work, which of course you have to have that if you want to create a Connected Trip with a single price point that one person pays one amount, but it's all the other types of things that we can provide that others really can't do on their own right now. So I'll take the air first and we'll see what David wants to say or not say about breakup of our customer base. So, air, obviously, Priceline has been doing it forever, since the company started, but in the U.S only. And Booking.com only got going this very, very recently and I mentioned 24 countries nice, but that's a lot of countries that we haven't touched yet that has to be done. And there's so many things that need to be done to really prove the air part of it Booking.com, I'm not going to list them all. But I see a lot of ways we can make that even better than it is. And that's a little bit while we haven't done any real large marketing effort on the air side yet. We got to have to talk a little bit before we start really marketing. So make sure you got the product the way you want it. So it's so encouraging that we're doing well with it right now, even though I see a lot of things that still need to be done to improve that product. It's something that we're really pleased with is seeing the attachment rate again, and something that we obviously the reason they want to do this is not just to sell a flight ticket is to actually get some of those higher margin those accommodations and build out that Connected Trip. So it's nice to see at a very early stage. And I urge you to say, listen, Kevin, I think very early stage, we're seeing good results. So I do see a lot of opportunity here in the future. But we won't be bringing out any sort of marketing on it until I feel that we have the product where we want it to be. And David, I don't know if you want to talk about the other one. Hi, Mark. So [indiscernible] just on what you said like too early, but I will add a little bit more -- I will add a little more to that. In a sense, I'm very pleased because we haven't been out really marking this yet. new customers are coming to the site, and then we're seeing them get a attractive cross-sell that I really like seeing that as a sign that this is the right direction that we're going in now. I had a good sense that was going to happen anyway, because we've been seeing that happen in Priceline for two decades where that's been happening. So I had good confidence that this would happen. But it's something that I believe we want to have a lot more data before we start coming back, U.S start showing you, here's what attachment rates are heroes, it compares to price lines, here's what we see versus industry and how many new people are coming from the air funnel versus the others, I would just leave everyone with the sense that we're very pleased. This is bringing us new customers, new customers who are buying not just flight tickets, but some of them are buying hotels, too. This is proving out a little bit of our long-term vision on this Connected Trip. Now, do I expect that to happen with something like activities? No, I'm not really think a lot of people are going to come for an activity first, then they're going to buy a flight or then they're going to buy a hotel. It's -- that's going to be a lot more the other way and helping produce the loyalty and the repeat business that we talked about. And then goes into all the things I was talking about in terms of using a wallet so we can get credits. Now, different suppliers, be able to promote different offerings in different ways to different customers, all that spins together, increasing that flywheel. And that's what we're trying to achieve, and it's just so great to see it start happening right now, even though it's very early. Yes, let me give a generalities about what I think about leader versus business and the purpose general what I think is going to be happening in the future. And David, go back and talk about what we've disclosed in the past about the mix. So I think you're right, in the sense that we are much more leisure oriented, and much of our business travel is small business people, these are people who are doing their own travel, this is not part of the big travel management company operation. So it's a little bit differently when we have business travelers and they act somewhat similar to leisure sometimes. The fact is, we've all seen is that leisure is out of the gate much faster than any business travel, which makes perfect sense. Because on the one hand, you have business people who say there's a risk factor when you put people in travel, etcetera. There's also the issue of costs. Why have people travel? You don't have to,. That second part, I think is very key for the future of the business. I believe that there's still going to be resistance by CFOs, now the people who are cost conscious in their businesses about do we really have to have all the travel we did in the past? Maybe not. Because with these new technologies, what we seem to be pretty effective without having to send somebody from New York to London and $15,000 for a one day meeting. I think that's going to somewhat change how the business of travel is done. There'll be fewer people up front in the plane, and spending a lot of money in those very high cost five star hotels, etcetera, which will change things a little bit. For us, we're leisure so it's not going to impact us negatively so much. In fact, they help us because there's more availability that needs to get filled up. The other thing you mentioned, though, was the NCR plays out though, with more people being able to work-from-home and deciding [indiscernible], I think Friday, I'm going to work from somewhere else and have a Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, mini holiday somewhere working Thursday, Friday, but at different location. How much is that going to actually build more travel? Uncertain at this time since everybody is still shifting around? What the way to work in the future? How many days are we in offices? How many days are we not in office? Nobody knows the answer to that yet. It's going to take a long time to play out. But I do hope that we'll hopefully build out more travel, we like more travel. So there's a lot of uncertainty about this and nobody really knows And even as much as I've heard the encouraging signs from some of the suppliers to some of the airlines, I saw a Deloitte report came out a couple of days ago, maybe yesterday in which the expectation of corporate travel was not as optimistic in the near-term. So I think we'd have to say, we don't know, we'll find out as it rolls out. And David, I don't know if you want to give anything more than that in terms of the numbers for us in business trial, because I heard a now where he quoted, I'm not sure those are right or not. So I will let David talk what you say about Asia in general. And regarding this year, I just want to be a little careful. We said we were pleased with that we are doing better, we're gaining. We're gaining share with the professional managers. And I like what we're seeing there. It's going to be a long haul in terms of building out the U.S inventory for all types of alternative accommodations, whether it be professionally managed, getting as many as you want there or single property is going to be a while to get to where we want to be in that. I understand that this is a goal that we're working on hard by having boots on the ground, talking to managers, sending out the right information, getting people to understand why we have a great proposition for them. And I'm confident we're going to do that. When you look at what we've achieved in Europe, you look at the share of our alternative accommodations in Europe, you say, boy, that's a goal to have in the U.S., too. We should be pushing for that. There's no reason we should. Customers are similar. The proposition is similar. There's nothing that we shouldn't be -- the reason we shouldn't be able to achieve that over time. But it's going to take time. David, I don't know if you want to talk about Asia a little bit there? Thank you. So in closing, I want to reiterate our strong belief that our industry's full recovery will be hastened by everyone who can get a vaccine going out and getting it. We urge all people who are approved for a medically able to be vaccinated, to do their part to make our society safer and go out and get a vaccine. And as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders, we appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you and please be safe. Good night."

And welcome to Booking Holdings first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.  I am pleased to start by reporting further improvement in our accommodations business, with first quarter room nights declining 54% versus Q1 2019, which was 6 percentage points better than our fourth quarter 2020 decline. This improvement was driven by solid signs of increasing travel demand in certain countries and by our team's strong execution. David will provide the details on our first quarter results in his remarks.  As we have said before, we believe that the rate of recovery for travel will depend heavily on the rate and severity of new COVID-19 cases, the timing of effective and broad-based vaccine distribution, and hopefully, even more effective treatments in the future.  While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the UK and the US are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs. In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends. We support our view that vaccine distribution is a key to unlocking pent up travel demand.  In our own survey work earlier in the year, we found that over 70% of Americans said that the early distribution stage of COVID-19 vaccines made them feel more hopeful and optimistic about traveling in 2021.  As countries ramp up vaccine distribution, which we are now starting to see in more European countries, we believe that we will start to see booking strength expand to more parts of the world.  While there are encouraging signs of recovery in some countries right now, the current situation in other countries such as India, where we are seeing staggering increases in COVID-19 cases and an enormous human tragedy happening reminds us that recovery is not underway everywhere. And unfortunately, in some countries, the situation is getting worse.  Last week, the World Health Organization warned that the pace of the pandemic is accelerating. We're mindful that governments may continue to take actions such as general area lockdowns or reintroducing travel restrictions, including barring people from high infection locations from entering the country. Any of these actions can have an impact on our performance, and it's difficult to predict when and to what extent such actions may be taken in the future.  Furthermore, international travel must recover for there to be a complete global travel recovery, and many governments may be cautious in fully opening international travel for some time.  Focusing on the US where the vaccination program is going well, I am very pleased with our first quarter results in the US and there's strong rebound in US travel demand. For Q1 in the US, we had positive room night growth versus Q1 2019 and it was our strongest performing major country. These results were driven by domestic bookings as our international business is still very slow.  We were pleased to see improvements in our US room night trends each month in Q1, and these improvements continued into April. The strength in the market benefited all of our travel products and helped drive the highest number of air tickets ever booked in a single quarter for our company. And we know that both Priceline and Booking.com had good US results during the first quarter.  In this improving environment, we continue to press ahead with one of our most important strategic strategies, strengthening the Booking.com brand in the US. You may have seen Booking.com US Back to Travel promotional campaign that we launched in April, which offered a $50 post-stay promotional travel credit for US travelers who activated the promotion in the Booking.com app and booked travel by the end of May.  This is just one example of the marketing methods that we will be employing to increase awareness of the Booking.com brand in the US. And in this case, drive further consumer engagement with our app.  We also remain focused on expanding the supply of Booking.com's alternative accommodation offering in the US and we targeted and signed new properties to the platform in the quarter. However, we recognize there's more work to be done to improve the breadth of this product in the US.  During the first quarter, we continued to execute against other key strategic priorities, such as expanding Booking.com's payment platform and building the Connected Trip vision.  Regarding our integrated payment platform at Booking.com, we've made recent progress primarily through increased adoption by our supply partners in the US. As I have mentioned previously, this platform provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions, and is foundational for enabling our Connected Trip strategy.  The Connected Trip is our vision of a multi-product offering including combinations, flight, ground transportation, attractions and dining, connected by our payment network, and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence to provide a frictionless, seamless experience for our bookers, all the way from first thinking about the initial booking to experiencing their trip to arriving back home.  Building out our full Connected Trips vision will be a multi-year endeavor. However, we expect that our business will benefit from the steps we are taking to achieve this vision long before reaching the ultimate end state.  For example, developing a robust flight product at Booking.com gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. We have not had these opportunities historically at Booking.com, given its accommodation only focus in the past.  As we think about the journey for building the Connected Trip, this year, we'll be focused on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. This means we will be working to build up our economic combination products like flights, ground transportation and attractions by increasing supply, as well as exposing more of our customers to these products.  And Booking.com's flight offering, we are now live in 18 countries with the most recent launch in the UK. We can now expose a large segment of customers to flights as these 18 countries collectively represented more than half of Booking.com's room nights booked in 2019. Booking.com's flight offering is now fully native in the app. And while early, we are in the process of beginning to utilize marketing channels to bring potential customers to the product.  On attractions, we have continued to expand the breadth of supply available to our travelers through our recent partnership with Viator along with our ongoing partnership with Musement that was announced last year.  We see real benefits of a strong attractions offering given the potential bundling opportunities, as well as the ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination.  Of course, many of our key strategic priorities \u2013 I mentioned the app, which indicates the importance of the app for our business. We've been investing in the app platform for some time, and will continue to invest as the app becomes the center of our connected trip experience.  In addition, we see better customer loyalty, lower customer acquisition costs, and more opportunities to engage directly with travelers through our app. Booking.com was the most downloaded travel app globally in the first quarter, according to a leading third party research firm. We now see over two-thirds of our bookings come through the mobile devices, a majority of which are on the app. One of Booking Holdings' goals is to do well in the area of sustainability. I was very pleased to recently make public our 2020 sustainability report. And one achievement that I am particularly proud of is Booking Holdings becoming operationally carbon neutral in 2020. This is a significant milestone for our business, and one we were working towards even prior to the pandemic. We intend to remain carbon neutral in our operations in the future and look forward to making progress on our sustainability strategy, including diversity and inclusion and sustainable travel. In conclusion, the exact shape and timing of the full recovery for travel remains uncertain. However, I am encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in some countries, and I'm confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally.  That being said, we are likely to experience volatility between now and then, with some countries recovering well, others beginning to recover, and unfortunately, some getting worse.  I'm proud of the actions that our teams across Booking Holdings continue to take to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. We are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. We are focused on building a larger and faster growing business that generates more earnings into the recovery and for the long run.  I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. \nDavid Goulden : Thank you, Glenn. And good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the first quarter and provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the second quarter. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread of the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated.  Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release.  I also want to remind you that, during the period of bookings recovering, revenue will recover more slowly than bookings due to timing differences and this will impact our booking to revenue take rates.  Now on to our results for the first quarter. On our February earnings call, we discussed the improvements in trends we saw starting the middle of January and continuing into February, driven by domestic travel in most parts of the world.  The improvement in trends continued into March, resulting in our Q1 reported room night declining 54% versus Q1 2019, which was a 6% improvement versus the decline we reported in Q4. As a reminder, reported room night include the impact of cancellations.  The improvements in the Q1 room night decline rate versus Q4 is driven by the US and Europe, while Asia and rest of world declines were about the same in Q1 as they were in Q4.  The US was the strongest performing major country in Q1 and had a positive room night growth versus 2019 for the full quarter. The trends in the US improved through Q1, with very strong room night growth versus 2019 for the month of March. Spring Break was a contributor to growth in March. US domestic room night growth was positive for each month of the quarter, with very strong growth for the full quarter.  In Q1, other countries also experienced very strong domestic room night growth, including Russia and Australia. And we saw continued strengthening in domestic bookings in Israel.  While Europe improved for the full quarter compared with Q4, we did see trends soften towards the end of March, driven by rising COVID case counts and new impositions of travel restrictions. Europe was the least recovered region in terms of room nights booked in Q4 and it remained the least recovered region in Q1.  Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continue to represent over two-thirds of our total room nights. Our direct channel gained share both sequentially and year-on-year.  Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q1, in line with our Q4 2020 mix of room nights and up significantly versus 2019. Our cancellation rates continue to be elevated versus 2019 in the quarter, but improved from levels we saw in Q4.  The booking window of Booking.com remained shorter than it was in the first quarter 2019 as we continue to see a higher mix of near-term bookings. However, the booking window contracted less than it did in the fourth quarter.  As we noted on the last call in January in February, we saw expansion of the booking window versus 2019 in Western Europe. And this expansion continued into March as the share of further out bookings, including those of summer travel, increased versus the same time in 2019. Due to the situation in Europe with new COVID cases, vaccination rates and travel restrictions, bookings are generally either very near term or for the summer period. The overall mix of customers booking alternative accommodations on Booking.com in Q1 was about the same as Q1 last year. As we noted last quarter, Europe is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations and Europe was the slowest growing region in the first quarter, which negatively impacted our alternative accommodation mix on a global basis. The mix of alternative accommodation in bookings in Europe increased by several percentage points year-over-year.  Gross bookings declined 53% in Q1, which is less than the decline in reported room nights, primarily due to strong performance in our flights business and partially offset by a 1% decline in average daily rates for accommodations versus 2019.  Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up 49% versus 2019, driven by strong growth of Priceline and by flight bookings of Booking.com and Agoda, both of which did not have flight products in Q1 2019.  Our accommodations' average day rates only declined 1% versus 2019, benefiting from a higher mix of North America, which is a higher ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, ADRs were down approximately mid-single digits. ADRs in the quarter were helped by the higher mix of summer bookings in Western Europe, which typically have higher ADRs. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $1.1 billion and decreased 61% versus 2019. Revenue in the quarter declined more than gross bookings due to bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check in in future quarters, at which points in time to revenue will be recognized.  Take rates in Q1 were a little less than 10%, largely driven by these timing differences. As you'll recall, we discussed the impact of timing on take rates in 2020 and 2021 during our last call. We expect timing to impact take rates all year, assuming the booking growth continues to improve during the year.  The 61% reduction in revenue resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $195 million in the quarter. We significantly reduced our variable expense lines, like marketing, sales and other, and while fixed expenses in Q1 were broadly in line with the commentary we provide our last call.  Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% versus 2019. Marketing expenses declined more than gross bookings due to an increase in our direct mix and slightly higher ROIs in paid channels.  Sales and other expenses in Q1 will lower than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, which was slightly better than our expectations. Personnel expenses were in line with our expectations. Q1 expenses were higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis due primarily to increased stock-based compensation expenses and seasonal increases in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to restriction actions we have taken.  G&A expenses were lower in Q1 than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis versus our expectation for them to be about in line due to lower-than-expected personnel-related costs and professional fees.  Information technology expenses were higher in Q1 than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, but were lower than our expectations due to timing of spend.  Finally, we recorded $8 million restructuring charges in Q1, which was lower than our prior expectations primarily due to timing of real estate restructuring charges. I note, these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results.  We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $215 million in the quarter. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 38% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impacts of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings.  On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $311 million in Q1. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $55 million in the quarter, helped by an income tax benefit of $223 million. Our Q1 tax rate of 80% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 21% due to the impact of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings and the impact of the discrete items recorded in the quarter.  Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of $16.4 billion benefited from the $2 billion raised in our euro bond offering completed in March.  In April, we used all the proceeds from the euro bond offering to redeem to higher coupon senior notes that we issued earlier in the pandemic last year. These refinancing actions we took will result in approximately $70 million in annualized interest rate expense savings and were NPV positive transactions. Adjusting our Q1 ending cash investments for the redemption of the two senior notes that happened in April will result in a balance of $14.4 billion, which is down from our December ending balance of $14.8 billion. We had a $207 million operating cash outflow in the quarter, driven primarily by change in working capital, which represented the use of cash about $216 million in the quarter.  We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our clients over the last year, we halted our repurchases of our stock and will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery.  Now on to our thoughts for the second quarter. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of recovery for travel, which means that we're unable to provide detailed guidance at this time.  April room night declined about 43% versus 2019 which is better than the decline in March. Domestic room night growth was about flat versus 2019 for the month of April, the best monthly result for domestic room nights since last summer.  On a regional basis, the US continued to have very strong room night growth in April and was above March levels. Europe room nights declines were better in April than in March, recovering from a softening of trends we saw at the end of March and the first week of April. Room night declines in Europe were down over 50% in April.  Asia room night declines worsened in April versus March as outbreaks in new cases increased, vaccination progress has been slow, and governments continued to impose restrictions on travel. Asia was the least recovered region in April.  The rest of the world declines were about the same in April as we were in Q1 and Q4.  While difficult to predict with accuracy, if current trends continue, Q2 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than in April. To give you a snapshot of what we're seeing recently, room night declines over the last seven days of April were about 38%.  As I noted earlier, in Western Europe, the booking window expanded in Q1. This expansion continues into April, and we continue to see positive summer booking trends in Western Europe. Across all of Western Europe, gross bookings for the summer period are now within 30% of where we were at the same time in 2019. And for the UK, they're now at about the same level as we were at the same time in 2019. We remind you that the significant majority of summer bookings are cancelable.  Turning to the income statements, as I said, we expect Q2 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than the decline in April. We expect Q2 gross bookings decline slightly less than room nights, driven by the same trends we saw in the first quarter.  We expect Q2 revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to timing factors we have discuss. As a result, we expect our Q2 revenue, as a percentage of gross bookings, will improve from Q1, but will be a few percentage points lower than in Q2 of 2019.  We expect marketing expenses in Q2 will decline a little more than gross bookings, but less than revenue. We expect sales and other expenses in Q2 to be up significantly versus Q1 on a dollar basis and will be a higher percentage of revenue due to higher gross booking volumes in the second quarter, as well as an increase in the mix of gross bookings processed on a merchant basis.  We expect personnel expenses in Q2 will be about the same as they were in Q1 on a dollar basis. Compared with Q1, SBC and benefit expenses are expected to be less, but this is offset by an increase in bonus accruals, which are recorded proportional to revenue.  We expect G&A expenses in Q2 will be higher than Q1 on a dollar basis, driven by a higher personnel related costs such as recruiting and T&E as well as higher professional fees and digital service taxes.  We expect IT expenses in Q2 will be higher than Q1 on a dollar basis due to increased investments in security, data privacy, and some operational systems enhancements, including some deferred expenses from Q1. We currently estimate the full year restructuring charges related to our actions of Booking.com will be approximately $30 million and we expect to record about half of these charges in the second quarter.  Given what we just explained, especially the timing difference between recovery of bookings and revenue, we expect recording an EBITDA loss in Q2, albeit less than the loss we reported in Q1. Depending upon how demand develops during the quarter, this could potentially be a small EBITDA loss in Q2.  For full-year 2021, we continue to expect that the overall environment for travel will improve during the year, but the shape and timing of that improvement remains uncertain.  As Glenn mentioned in his remarks, while we're seeing recovery and other encouraging signs in some countries, other countries and regions are struggling with a rapidly growing COVID wave.  Globally, the number of new cases reported is increasing, with a record 5.7 million new cases recorded the week of April 19. This is directly impacting our business across much of Asia.  As a reminder about the [indiscernible] of our model during the recovery, we continue to expect that if we see continued recovery in 2021, there'll be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in in 2022 than there were bookings made in 2020 that checked in in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, and also drive de-leverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our marketing expenses at the time of booking. To remind you, in 2018 and 2019, our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was approximately 15.6%. This increased to 19.2% in 2020. We expect this percentage will be well below 15.6% in 2021. And the faster the recovery occurs, the lower this percentage will be.  Before closing, there's been a lot of interest in our commentary in February about the longer-term model for our business. I want to reiterate what we said previously and also provide some more color.  We continue to believe it will be years, not quarters, before we see a full recovery of the travel market, especially international travel. Looking beyond 2021, we continue to look forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we had prior to COVID. We also remain focused on the potential for higher growth and market share.  We expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely levels below those in 2019, driven by mix shifts within the business that I discussed on the last call. As a reminder, these mix shifts include the continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other Connected Trip verticals, which will add revenue and EBITDA, but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations.  As we think about the future shape of our accommodation business, there are a few factors to consider. As discussed on the last call, we expect our personnel expenses in 2021 to be about the same as in 2019 as the savings from restructuring actions taken in 2020 are expected to be offset by personnel run rate investments made pre-COVID and personnel investments expected in 2021. Of course, some of these investments are to support payments and the Connected Trip.  As we look beyond 2021, the $370 million in savings from restructuring actions were mainly involving related functions, meaning that as volumes grow back to levels which we expect \u2013 which means as volumes go beyond levels we expect in 2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business.  As we mentioned before, we'll look to do this in cost effective ways. But the work will come back. And when added to our 2021 personnel cost base will put pressure on our accommodation business EBITDA margins relative to 2019 at the same level of volumes we had in 2019 and at the same growth rates.  Of course, there are offsetting factors that could improve margins, including variable cost efficiencies for additional scale, as we build well beyond 2019 volumes from fixed cost efficiencies and from increased direct mix.  The last thought I'd like to leave you with on this topic is that we believe that the recovery of the travel market will create opportunities to invest, to gain share in accommodations, which could put pressure on margins during a period of share gains.  In conclusion, we are pleased to see the recovery discussed in February continued into March and April in some parts of the world, leading to improvement in our top line metrics.  We're also watching the spread of COVID and the distribution of effective vaccines very carefully and realize this may lead to continued volatility ahead. We remain confident that we can emerge from this crisis in a stronger position.  With that, we'll take your questions. And, Grace, we'll hand over to you to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America.\nJustin Post: I think a couple of things would help. Can you give us any updates or your thoughts on mix between US, Europe and Asia, just so we can think about the recovery? And then, can you remind us what happened in Europe last summer when cases came down? Did you see a rapid increase? And are you seeing bookings pick up as people are vaccinated right now in Europe? \nDavid Goulden: David, why don't you take the\u2026? \nDavid Goulden: Justin, let me take that. So, just to remind you of our historic mix, we have basically said that Europe is, of course, our largest region historically. If you think kind of roughly 50% or maybe a little bit more, you wouldn't be far off being correct. Asia, we said, historically, again pre-COVID, was about 20% with no single country being more than low-single digits. And that means that you've really got 30% left for US and rest of world combined. So, that is our pre-COVID mix. Obviously, that mix changed a little bit with the dynamic of what's happened recently. Obviously, the US has gone up as that's been the most recovered marketplace. So, that's the historic reference points.  In terms of last summer, we saw a couple of things. We, of course, did see, after the first wave came down, we saw people getting more confident with traveling. Of course, vaccines were still not available at that point in time. So, people were kind of traveling quite carefully and traveling locally. What we have seen and we saw in several places, what we've seen so far is a very consistent trend, that when cases come down, when vaccination rates go up, when government restrictions start to lift, good things happen. We see that happening in the US right now. We see that happening in Israel. We mentioned a couple of other areas that are doing better than the average. So, our expectation is that we'll see those positive trends start to occur in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe as things are starting to improve. As we mentioned, we are seeing things improving on April versus March and Europe is now no longer the least recovered region.\nJustin Post: Maybe one follow-up. You mentioned share gains. Maybe for Glenn, the opportunities. Maybe you can give us a little more color on that. And do you think your US bookings are trending above kind of industry averages right now.\nGlenn Fogel: As I said, I'm very pleased with the Q1 results in the US. I mentioned both Priceline.com and Booking.com doing well. So, we are very happy about that. I don't have \u2013 we're not done with the quarter yet. So, we don't have industrywide numbers to go against. So, I'm just going to say that I'm pleased with what we're producing and we'll see everybody's reported how we did.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: I have a couple of follow-ups on the US growth. Can you give us any more of a sense of how much Q1 improved versus Q4. And obviously, the overall industry improved in the US in the first quarter quite a bit, but was Booking.Com or bookings growth in the US also a product of any specific decisions you made in the first quarter along the lines of your new strategic \u2013 increasing strategic focus on US share gains, for example, changing the way you're doing marketing or anything like that?\nGlenn Fogel: Why don't I talk generally about strategy and then, David, if he wants \u2013 I'm not sure he wants to disclose anything more about specific numbers and gains. I will say this. I've said this in several calls in the past, actually many, about increasing our performance in the US is a strategic priority. And we have said that we under index in the US. So, we are doing many, many things to try and improve that. And everything from the basics of making sure we have the right selections of properties that people want to making sure it's the right price, making sure we're competitive. I talked about how we had to have the US payments platform up and running for Booking.com, so we can do creative, new things such as our back to travel promo, which of course wasn't in Q1, but just another example of things that we're doing.  And there's a lot of just blocking and tackling done by both teams, Priceline.com and the people at Booking.com, working with our suppliers, coming up with ways that we can help them get more customers. So, it's so many different things. There's no one thing to say that was the silver bullet. And I expect that we will be able to continue to do this. I hope to be able to continue to do this in the future. It will remain a priority for us. And, David, if you want to talk about numbers.\nDavid Goulden: I will just, Kevin, reiterate what we said and give you a little flavor, make sure you understand where the emphasis was. So, things did improve significantly sequentially in the US during the quarter, and we have positive room night growth in the US year-on-year, which is great, because, obviously, international business was still down a fair amount. When we got into March, that room night growth in the US was very strong, which I characterize that as above any of our normal growth rates. That strengthened further into April. So, very strong plus. And then if you just kind of double click down and look at just the domestic, recognizing there is some substitution effect in there, the growth rates in the US was very strong for the entire quarter, positive for each month of the quarter and getting stronger, was again stronger in April than it was in March. \nKevin Kopelman: If I could, just one follow-up on, you did the $50 travel credit promo in April. You see that as kind of an ongoing tactic or strategy that you might use? How much would this shift be a shift in costs from marketing spend to contra-revenue? \nGlenn Fogel: Well, we just put it out. Still an opportunity still to book on that one. It goes till the end of May for US people. They can still do a book, but they had to do the \u2013 in April, they had to actually activate it. So, we don't have a lot of [indiscernible] to tell you what we think that's going to be. It certainly is something that \u2013 it's one different thing that I pointed out, not because a huge driver, but just an example of things that we haven't done in the past that we will do in the future. And in fact, you may have noticed it, we started a very similar, but not exactly the same program in the UK yesterday. Or maybe it's two days ago.  The point being that we're trying to be more creative and going forward coming up with different ways to bring those customers to us, show them what a great product we have, great service we have and make sure they come back to us in the future, albeit not with the promotion. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: I've got two questions. I want to first start off, I think, Glenn, you made some comments about the mix of alternative accommodations, and being I think relatively similar in the March quarter versus a year ago. And I guess, I would have thought that it would have been kind of structurally higher, that somehow because of \u2013 during the COVID crisis. I know you talked about that mix increasing. Did you expect it to recover back? Would you expect it to revert back to where it was before? That is alternative accommodations as a percentage of your lodging mix. Or would you expect it to be somewhat elevated post COVID just because of the greater exposure that a lot of consumers had to that during the crisis? \nGlenn Fogel: Mark, I'll answer your question first about the general, what I expect in the future, and I'll let \u2013 it was Dave that talked about the mix and he can talk about \u2013 because we have more in Europe and it's the US, and I'll let him go through that [indiscernible] why we are where we are.  In terms of the future, here's the situation. We've been seeing for many, many years \u2013 and everyone's aware of this \u2013 that people have been more interested in the alternative accommodation. This is a global phenomenon. It's been going up at a steady rate for some time. COVID created a step functional change where people who may never have thought about an alternative accommodations, now they're thinking I want to go to a home that's not near people, maybe near the beach or near the mountains and I feel safer there. Now, having tried that, in the future, the question is you just asked is, will people go back to their former habits of some people going to hotels, some people homes and it will be a more gradual increase and will be a drop back first and then back up? I don't think anybody really knows.  But I would make the guess that people having tried the alternative accommodations during the pandemic will forever have it in their consideration set. And they may not always use it, they will choose what type of property fits their needs. But now, because it is part of their consideration set, I think there is a functional change in increased mix in the long run. That being said, for us, we do both. We have the greatest selection of both hotels and non-hotel accommodations together combined. So, we feel we are very well positioned globally for that. Though I have spoken in the past, in some regions, we are definitely in sufficient supply that we need to build up.  And David, do you want to explain again about the issue because of mix in terms of geographies and the mix in properties? \nDavid Goulden: Mark, let me just explain that maybe in a slightly different way. So, starting with Europe, if you just look at our business within Europe, you only looked at it with that lens, you would see alternative accommodation mix in Q1 this last year up a fair amount compared to Q1 2020 and also versus Q1 of 2019. So within Europe, where we have our largest mix of alternative accommodation, we see an increase in mix. But you also remember, I said that Europe in Q1 was our lowest performing region. And of course, the highest performing region was the US where we have a much larger mix of alternative accommodation. So, that's mix effect means that, in total, our alternative accommodation mix did not increase. But in Europe, for example, where it's the largest, it did increase a fair amount. So mix effect is really the biggest region. In total, in Q1, the mix of alternative accommodations was very similar to the 30% number we gave out for all of FY 2020. But again, within different regions, there are shifts occurring. \nMark Mahaney: If I can ask one follow-on question, I think you talked about a better ROI in paid marketing channels. And just your guess as to whether that's sustainable or not. Thanks a lot. \nDavid Goulden: That's a good question. There are many things going on in ROI. So, yes, we did see slightly improved ROI on the paid channels. We also saw an increase in direct mix. And those two together let us have marketing grow less than bookings in the quarter. But there are many factors that go into accounting ROI, including your cost per click, conversion rate, cancellation rates, and we're still in a period of, I'd say, high volatility across all of those. So, it's not reasonable to point to any one factor as to why ROIs were up, but they were up slightly [indiscernible]. And it's only just one quarter. So, given the volatility of things happening, we wanted to point it out, but too early to call a trend. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank.\nChristopher Kuntarich: This is Chris on for Lloyd. Can you just talk a little bit about, I guess, booking frequency associated. It sounds like there has been meaningful pickup in share with you guys' app. Just kind of talk to us a little bit about booking frequency on app and how that compares to non-app users. Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: David, I don't know if you ever disclosed anything in terms of frequency on the app? \nDavid Goulden: No. Chris, let me tell you about what we have talked about and see if that answers the question and then maybe we haven't got your question completely right. But just to kind of remind us where we are right now, over two thirds of our bookings are mobile, majority of those are on app. Our app booking customers are our most frequent bookers relative to other direct channels. Because always we can have a direct booking through a mobile web direct booking or through a desktop booking. And the app bookers are the most loyal and the most returning. But we really haven't gone into frequency. And also, I'd say right now, in the current environment where we're still very much recovering, frequency metrics are not the most critical ones that we focus on right now. It's more the overall top line growth rates.  But we are pleased what we're seeing with a trend towards app usage, the increase in the mix and the repeat behavior of app users. Those are all positive things for us. \nChristopher Kuntarich: Just want to make sure, more of a housekeeping question. I saw a little bit of repurchase activity that was not related to you guys starting up your buyback again, is that correct? \nDavid Goulden: No, that was related to employee stock purchases. That was not buyback related.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. \nAlaxandar Wang: This is Alax Wang on for Brian. Thanks for taking our question. First, just on flights, I appreciate the update on the rollout to 18 countries. Maybe any early learnings you could share with us, particularly in the US and potentially attach rates that you could share and sort of what do you foresee as the key two or three incremental investments to sort of execute on flights as we progress through the year?\nGlenn Fogel: We don't give away \u2013 I don't believe we ever talked about the actual attach rates. But I will say that that is an important reason we do flights and that getting that booker upfront is important, so that we can then get them to buy something that will have a higher margin.  The 18 countries in the Booking.com is now working in, we are getting initial \u2013 and we've been doing it for some time now, obviously, I guess a year now approximately. We are getting some learnings, how can we improve it, how can we make it better? We really haven't marketed this at all in terms of the way we market our hotels offering because we want to get it right before we start spending a lot of money. We don't want to waste money as you know.  I am very pleased, though, with the very limited effort that we've done that people are using it and we are getting feedback that people are coming back. So, that's good. It's something that's important for the long run. And I want to emphasize how much this is a long game we're playing here because, as you know, the number is still very, very, very small and this is very early. But we hope in the long run that this connected trip, which is not just the flights, but it's also the ground transportation and the attractions and the dining, all the things that people do when they are traveling, to create something that makes them want to always use our app more than anything else. When they think of travel, they come back to us. So, it's critical that we have that first thing, which is important to a lot of people, flights. And we're going to continue to make investments into it to make sure that is absolutely a great, great service. \nAlaxandar Wang: Just one follow-up. I think a couple quarters ago, you guys had tested a digital brand campaign. I'm not sure if there's anything you can share on that. But maybe bigger picture, as we look at the performance channels ex search, do you see any opportunities to sort of lean into more of the non-search performance channels with online video as we're seeing increasing sort of digital transformation as a result of the pandemic? \nGlenn Fogel: We recognize that's where the eyeballs are going. So, we need to make sure that we are putting our name appropriately in front. So, people when they think of travel, they think of us. So we are cognizant of that fact and we are we are working on that. So yes, we will continue to work with that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu from Barclays. \nMario Lu: I have one on agency versus merchant bookings and one on payments. So, the one on agency versus a merchant, it looks like the merchant bookings recovered to a level much quicker in 1Q compared to agency. Is there anything to kind of call out there to explain the quicker recovery?  And then on payments, you guys mentioned you guys are north of 20% of bookings. Is there a specific target you guys plan to reach in the long term? And how should that flow through to say revenue and operating margins over time?\nGlenn Fogel: Dave, why don't you talk to about agency/merchant question and I'll talk about the long vision on payments. \nDavid Goulden: Actually, we saw a slightly lower mix of merchants in Q1 this year than in Q1 last year, both in total and at Booking.com. Because bear in mind, you're kind of comparing essentially an almost a non-crisis quarter \u2013 last year, of course, Q1, in March, things got worse, but most of the quarter was not crisis. And now you're talking about \u2013 comparing with a quarter that is very much still in the crisis with recovery mode. So, people in the short term, looking at the more flexible agency, pay the hotel model because that has just an attractive proposition in times like this when flexibility becomes very, very important. We do expect the merchant business to actually increase during the year at Booking.com where we have obviously the big mix shift happening. And we still think that the merchants business in total in 2021 will be a slightly higher mix than it was in 2020. But of course, flexibility is one of the factors that is important as people are looking at the bookings in this environment. So that's what's going on this year. \nGlenn Fogel: In the long view, we'd like to get as much business as possible on payments because we believe we'll create a better service for both our customers for traveling and our supplier partners to be able to do all sorts of things you can't do when it's just a straight agency play. And we believe we can provide value to everyone in that way. And I gave that example earlier about \u2013 we couldn't do a back to trial promotion if we didn't have a payment product to do that. And there are many ways we're going to be able to merchandise people's \u2013 our supplier partners, different ways to merchandise their offerings in ways that you can really only do well with a payment platform. And, of course, putting things together, bundling, all different things. So obviously, we would like to get as many people in because it's good for everybody who comes into it, both the customer and the supplier. That being said, we know that we'll never get to 100%. There will be \u2013 still be lots of people who will say, all I need is hotel, I like this agency thing, I pay the desk, it's all fine, we'll see if that happens, whatever. But even in that situation, we may actually do the payment for the hotel in a way that we can save them money. So it's a great opportunity for us. But it's the long view and it's going to take some time to get there. \nDavid Goulden: Just to kind of reiterate what we said before about how it plays out in the income statements, we get additional revenue from providing the payment service. We have a variable cost related to that sitting in sales and other, which is where you see the biggest offsetting a cost element to offset \u2013 to match the revenue. There are some incremental expenses, obviously, in our other lines as well related to running the payments program, but the biggest variable cost is sitting in sales and other. As we mentioned, in 2020, the payments business operated very close to breakeven when factoring particularly variable costs into account, which is an improvement from what it was before. And it's obviously an enabler for business, as Glenn just articulated. So, we want to continue to grow the mix and maintain that breakeven profile as we're growing it out, recognizing that, in the future, we recognize there are monetization opportunities that can lead to incremental EBITDA from the payments business, which we expect, albeit at lower margin rates than core accommodations. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. \nDae Lee: This is Dae on for Doug. Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on your alternative accommodation product. You've talked about works needed to improve the product in the US. Is that just inventory and awareness that you've talked about in the past? Or are there other areas where you see opportunities to improve?  And then, just on the room night growth and booking growth, it seems like there's been a sizable divergence in trajectory. Kind of feel [indiscernible] anything else notable that's driving that and how should we think about the relationship between the two going forward?\nGlenn Fogel: I'll take the first and, Dave, why don't you take the second? So, in terms of the alternative accommodations in the States, the things you mentioned are very, very important. We've got to have the right properties for the customer. And I've talked about this in the past that we under-index with the private homes, the single homes in the States. And that has been a popular product in the States because of the pandemic. And that's something that we are continuing to work on in the future. It's also just the process in general, how we get people on board, who we're dealing with to get them to come in. And we currently are using the multi-product property managers more than, say, some of our competitors who go out and get individual properties. So, there's a difference in how we're doing it right now.  I do believe this is a very, very achievable goal to be as competitive as anybody else. As David mentioned earlier about mix, we do a great business in Europe in the alternative accommodations area. A very good business. And there's no reason we shouldn't be able to do the exact same thing here in the States, though it is taking time. \nDavid Goulden: On what's going on between the dynamic between room night growth and booking growth, a couple of factors going on here. One, I mentioned the fact that we're doing \u2013 that we're seeing better booking growth performance from flights because of volume. And also, we are doing \u2013 even though the units are down for 4% to 6% in car, there's actually fairly good increase in rates for cars. So total bookings, the TGV, has done better for both flights and cars than it did for accommodations. But the biggest factor is really what's going on with ADRs. And there has been a bit of a shift in what we've seen even in the last couple of months. And we are \u2013 saw that ADRs in the quarter were only down 1%. Now, I would say a couple of things. Now, the like-for-like ADRs are absolutely still under pressure due to lower occupancy rates. But there are some mix benefits that really impact the year-on-year comparison. The first mix benefit was the mix shift towards the US as the US really started to accelerate, particularly in March. You saw a really fast pickup in growth rates in March that we were not forecasting when we last met you. So, that was a positive for room night growth, but also for ADRs.  And also in Europe, what's happening is, right now, because there are still a lot of restrictions, people booking today are booking generally more often for the summer holiday and the summer holiday period in Europe has higher ADRs than most short-term stays. So, those two mix effects are really helping the ADR picture. And we expect this \u2013 both the phenomena that I talked about in terms of air and car and ADRs are likely to go through to Q2 as well.  But we do think the ADRs will start to be driven down again in the second half due to a couple of reasons. Again, the like-for-like ADRs are under pressure. As an example, our stay ADRs in the first quarter were down mid-teens if you exclude regional mix. That's more of a kind of like-for-like comparison. So, that like-for-like comparison is more likely to kind of be exposed in the second half. Regional mix may continue to help. But then, we do think that this earlier booking of the summer \u2013 benefit of the summer bookings will fade and the reported ADRs will become more comparable with the underlying stay ADRs and those will converge back together more in the second half than they did in the first half. So, some interesting phenomena going on with mix and with booking window in Europe driving what we're going to see in Q1 and Q2.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research.\nDeepak Mathivanan: Just a couple ones. So, first, wanted to go back to your comment about investing to gain share with the margin opportunity? How should we think about your approach strategically? Is it on variable marketing channels? Obviously, there's a few products that you have talked about before, but are there any other initiatives that you would know that's something that could be impactful during this recovery period?  And then the second question is on the labor market situation here in the US. Obviously, it is very tight. And some of the hotel operators have called out the challenges there as well. How do you think this affects your business, if at all? Maybe broadly, talk about how supply side is evolving during the recovery.\nGlenn Fogel: I'll start with the second part, labor. And I'll let David go back to margins and how things can look as we continue to go for the future. So, certainly, we've all read news articles about shortages right now popping up in different areas of the hospitality industry. And some of the leaders in the industry, particularly some of the hotels and restaurants saying just can't get workers. But I don't believe that's going to impact where people aren't going to be able to find a place to stay at all. Right now, there is no shortage in my mind of great places for people to go to. And I don't see that happening. Yes, some property types may be short at certain times during high season, particularly, some of the very popular areas in the summer as leisure comes back in some parts of the world. But overall for the business, I don't see this as a significant or even a small risk to the business at all.  And Dave, you can talk a little bit about margin.\nDavid Goulden: Clearly, in a business like ours, there's always a trade-off between growth and profitability or growth and margins, particularly in the short term. And the areas that we would expect to be leaning into, there are a number of initiatives that we can drive to \u2013 lean into to drive further growth. Obviously, we need to be smart and we need to be nimble, we need to look at where the pockets of opportunity are. But we continue to be, I think, a very good marketeer in the pay channels and look at those demand opportunities and really have the opportunity to lean into those where we think we can and where we think we can actually gain incremental traffic.  We can do things with merchandising, and we can also do things with things like promotions, like back to travel. Also, there are areas like brands. So, there are multiple levers we can pull to drive growth above market where we believe there are opportunities to do so. We believe that the recovery obviously presents a very dynamic environment for everybody. And we want to make sure that we are taking advantage of opportunities that we can either make or made for us. And those are the things that would, in the short term, impact margins. Bear in mind, as we talked about what's happening this year, during periods of time when bookings are growing faster than revenue, that impacts the business because, generally, our expenses are associated upfront with capturing the booking and the revenue comes later. So those are all things that go into the dynamics around growth versus margin in the accommodation business. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone. And that's all the questions that we have for today. I'll turn the call over back to our CEO, Glenn Fogel, for any closing remarks. \nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. So, in closing, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to navigate through these better, though still difficult times, and we want to continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, and please be safe. Good night.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn. And good afternoon. I'll review our operating results for the first quarter and provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the second quarter. To avoid the comparison to the initial spread of the pandemic in 2020, all growth rates are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated.  Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release.  I also want to remind you that, during the period of bookings recovering, revenue will recover more slowly than bookings due to timing differences and this will impact our booking to revenue take rates.  Now on to our results for the first quarter. On our February earnings call, we discussed the improvements in trends we saw starting the middle of January and continuing into February, driven by domestic travel in most parts of the world.  The improvement in trends continued into March, resulting in our Q1 reported room night declining 54% versus Q1 2019, which was a 6% improvement versus the decline we reported in Q4. As a reminder, reported room night include the impact of cancellations.  The improvements in the Q1 room night decline rate versus Q4 is driven by the US and Europe, while Asia and rest of world declines were about the same in Q1 as they were in Q4.  The US was the strongest performing major country in Q1 and had a positive room night growth versus 2019 for the full quarter. The trends in the US improved through Q1, with very strong room night growth versus 2019 for the month of March. Spring Break was a contributor to growth in March. US domestic room night growth was positive for each month of the quarter, with very strong growth for the full quarter.  In Q1, other countries also experienced very strong domestic room night growth, including Russia and Australia. And we saw continued strengthening in domestic bookings in Israel.  While Europe improved for the full quarter compared with Q4, we did see trends soften towards the end of March, driven by rising COVID case counts and new impositions of travel restrictions. Europe was the least recovered region in terms of room nights booked in Q4 and it remained the least recovered region in Q1.  Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, continue to represent over two-thirds of our total room nights. Our direct channel gained share both sequentially and year-on-year.  Domestic room nights represented about 85% of our reported room nights in Q1, in line with our Q4 2020 mix of room nights and up significantly versus 2019. Our cancellation rates continue to be elevated versus 2019 in the quarter, but improved from levels we saw in Q4.  The booking window of Booking.com remained shorter than it was in the first quarter 2019 as we continue to see a higher mix of near-term bookings. However, the booking window contracted less than it did in the fourth quarter.  As we noted on the last call in January in February, we saw expansion of the booking window versus 2019 in Western Europe. And this expansion continued into March as the share of further out bookings, including those of summer travel, increased versus the same time in 2019. Due to the situation in Europe with new COVID cases, vaccination rates and travel restrictions, bookings are generally either very near term or for the summer period. The overall mix of customers booking alternative accommodations on Booking.com in Q1 was about the same as Q1 last year. As we noted last quarter, Europe is where we have our highest mix of alternative accommodations and Europe was the slowest growing region in the first quarter, which negatively impacted our alternative accommodation mix on a global basis. The mix of alternative accommodation in bookings in Europe increased by several percentage points year-over-year.  Gross bookings declined 53% in Q1, which is less than the decline in reported room nights, primarily due to strong performance in our flights business and partially offset by a 1% decline in average daily rates for accommodations versus 2019.  Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up 49% versus 2019, driven by strong growth of Priceline and by flight bookings of Booking.com and Agoda, both of which did not have flight products in Q1 2019.  Our accommodations' average day rates only declined 1% versus 2019, benefiting from a higher mix of North America, which is a higher ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, ADRs were down approximately mid-single digits. ADRs in the quarter were helped by the higher mix of summer bookings in Western Europe, which typically have higher ADRs. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $1.1 billion and decreased 61% versus 2019. Revenue in the quarter declined more than gross bookings due to bookings made in the quarter that are expected to check in in future quarters, at which points in time to revenue will be recognized.  Take rates in Q1 were a little less than 10%, largely driven by these timing differences. As you'll recall, we discussed the impact of timing on take rates in 2020 and 2021 during our last call. We expect timing to impact take rates all year, assuming the booking growth continues to improve during the year.  The 61% reduction in revenue resulted in an adjusted EBITDA loss of $195 million in the quarter. We significantly reduced our variable expense lines, like marketing, sales and other, and while fixed expenses in Q1 were broadly in line with the commentary we provide our last call.  Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 61% versus 2019. Marketing expenses declined more than gross bookings due to an increase in our direct mix and slightly higher ROIs in paid channels.  Sales and other expenses in Q1 will lower than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, which was slightly better than our expectations. Personnel expenses were in line with our expectations. Q1 expenses were higher than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis due primarily to increased stock-based compensation expenses and seasonal increases in benefit costs, partially offset by a higher amount of savings in Q1 related to restriction actions we have taken.  G&A expenses were lower in Q1 than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis versus our expectation for them to be about in line due to lower-than-expected personnel-related costs and professional fees.  Information technology expenses were higher in Q1 than they were in Q4 on a dollar basis, but were lower than our expectations due to timing of spend.  Finally, we recorded $8 million restructuring charges in Q1, which was lower than our prior expectations primarily due to timing of real estate restructuring charges. I note, these restructuring charges are included in our non-GAAP results.  We recorded a non-GAAP net loss of $215 million in the quarter. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 38% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 19% due to the greater impacts of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings.  On a GAAP basis, we had an operating loss of $311 million in Q1. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $55 million in the quarter, helped by an income tax benefit of $223 million. Our Q1 tax rate of 80% was meaningfully higher than our 2019 tax rate of 21% due to the impact of non-tax deductible expenses on a lower base of earnings and the impact of the discrete items recorded in the quarter.  Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of $16.4 billion benefited from the $2 billion raised in our euro bond offering completed in March.  In April, we used all the proceeds from the euro bond offering to redeem to higher coupon senior notes that we issued earlier in the pandemic last year. These refinancing actions we took will result in approximately $70 million in annualized interest rate expense savings and were NPV positive transactions. Adjusting our Q1 ending cash investments for the redemption of the two senior notes that happened in April will result in a balance of $14.4 billion, which is down from our December ending balance of $14.8 billion. We had a $207 million operating cash outflow in the quarter, driven primarily by change in working capital, which represented the use of cash about $216 million in the quarter.  We will continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position, given the high level of uncertainty created by the COVID pandemic. And consistent with our clients over the last year, we halted our repurchases of our stock and will not initiate repurchases until we have better visibility into the shape and timing of a recovery.  Now on to our thoughts for the second quarter. There continues to be considerable uncertainty about the shape and timing of recovery for travel, which means that we're unable to provide detailed guidance at this time.  April room night declined about 43% versus 2019 which is better than the decline in March. Domestic room night growth was about flat versus 2019 for the month of April, the best monthly result for domestic room nights since last summer.  On a regional basis, the US continued to have very strong room night growth in April and was above March levels. Europe room nights declines were better in April than in March, recovering from a softening of trends we saw at the end of March and the first week of April. Room night declines in Europe were down over 50% in April.  Asia room night declines worsened in April versus March as outbreaks in new cases increased, vaccination progress has been slow, and governments continued to impose restrictions on travel. Asia was the least recovered region in April.  The rest of the world declines were about the same in April as we were in Q1 and Q4.  While difficult to predict with accuracy, if current trends continue, Q2 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than in April. To give you a snapshot of what we're seeing recently, room night declines over the last seven days of April were about 38%.  As I noted earlier, in Western Europe, the booking window expanded in Q1. This expansion continues into April, and we continue to see positive summer booking trends in Western Europe. Across all of Western Europe, gross bookings for the summer period are now within 30% of where we were at the same time in 2019. And for the UK, they're now at about the same level as we were at the same time in 2019. We remind you that the significant majority of summer bookings are cancelable.  Turning to the income statements, as I said, we expect Q2 room night declines could be a few percentage points better than the decline in April. We expect Q2 gross bookings decline slightly less than room nights, driven by the same trends we saw in the first quarter.  We expect Q2 revenue to decline more than gross bookings due to timing factors we have discuss. As a result, we expect our Q2 revenue, as a percentage of gross bookings, will improve from Q1, but will be a few percentage points lower than in Q2 of 2019.  We expect marketing expenses in Q2 will decline a little more than gross bookings, but less than revenue. We expect sales and other expenses in Q2 to be up significantly versus Q1 on a dollar basis and will be a higher percentage of revenue due to higher gross booking volumes in the second quarter, as well as an increase in the mix of gross bookings processed on a merchant basis.  We expect personnel expenses in Q2 will be about the same as they were in Q1 on a dollar basis. Compared with Q1, SBC and benefit expenses are expected to be less, but this is offset by an increase in bonus accruals, which are recorded proportional to revenue.  We expect G&A expenses in Q2 will be higher than Q1 on a dollar basis, driven by a higher personnel related costs such as recruiting and T&E as well as higher professional fees and digital service taxes.  We expect IT expenses in Q2 will be higher than Q1 on a dollar basis due to increased investments in security, data privacy, and some operational systems enhancements, including some deferred expenses from Q1. We currently estimate the full year restructuring charges related to our actions of Booking.com will be approximately $30 million and we expect to record about half of these charges in the second quarter.  Given what we just explained, especially the timing difference between recovery of bookings and revenue, we expect recording an EBITDA loss in Q2, albeit less than the loss we reported in Q1. Depending upon how demand develops during the quarter, this could potentially be a small EBITDA loss in Q2.  For full-year 2021, we continue to expect that the overall environment for travel will improve during the year, but the shape and timing of that improvement remains uncertain.  As Glenn mentioned in his remarks, while we're seeing recovery and other encouraging signs in some countries, other countries and regions are struggling with a rapidly growing COVID wave.  Globally, the number of new cases reported is increasing, with a record 5.7 million new cases recorded the week of April 19. This is directly impacting our business across much of Asia.  As a reminder about the [indiscernible] of our model during the recovery, we continue to expect that if we see continued recovery in 2021, there'll be more bookings made in 2021 that will check in in 2022 than there were bookings made in 2020 that checked in in 2021. This timing factor could have a meaningfully negative impact on our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, and also drive de-leverage in our marketing expenses in 2021 as we incur the majority of our marketing expenses at the time of booking. To remind you, in 2018 and 2019, our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was approximately 15.6%. This increased to 19.2% in 2020. We expect this percentage will be well below 15.6% in 2021. And the faster the recovery occurs, the lower this percentage will be.  Before closing, there's been a lot of interest in our commentary in February about the longer-term model for our business. I want to reiterate what we said previously and also provide some more color.  We continue to believe it will be years, not quarters, before we see a full recovery of the travel market, especially international travel. Looking beyond 2021, we continue to look forward to being a larger business with more diverse offerings and with more earnings than we had prior to COVID. We also remain focused on the potential for higher growth and market share.  We expect to continue to have industry-leading EBITDA margin rates, albeit most likely levels below those in 2019, driven by mix shifts within the business that I discussed on the last call. As a reminder, these mix shifts include the continued growth of payments and the growth of flights and other Connected Trip verticals, which will add revenue and EBITDA, but at much lower margin rates than traditional accommodations.  As we think about the future shape of our accommodation business, there are a few factors to consider. As discussed on the last call, we expect our personnel expenses in 2021 to be about the same as in 2019 as the savings from restructuring actions taken in 2020 are expected to be offset by personnel run rate investments made pre-COVID and personnel investments expected in 2021. Of course, some of these investments are to support payments and the Connected Trip.  As we look beyond 2021, the $370 million in savings from restructuring actions were mainly involving related functions, meaning that as volumes grow back to levels which we expect \u2013 which means as volumes go beyond levels we expect in 2021, we'll need to add expenses back to business.  As we mentioned before, we'll look to do this in cost effective ways. But the work will come back. And when added to our 2021 personnel cost base will put pressure on our accommodation business EBITDA margins relative to 2019 at the same level of volumes we had in 2019 and at the same growth rates.  Of course, there are offsetting factors that could improve margins, including variable cost efficiencies for additional scale, as we build well beyond 2019 volumes from fixed cost efficiencies and from increased direct mix.  The last thought I'd like to leave you with on this topic is that we believe that the recovery of the travel market will create opportunities to invest, to gain share in accommodations, which could put pressure on margins during a period of share gains.  In conclusion, we are pleased to see the recovery discussed in February continued into March and April in some parts of the world, leading to improvement in our top line metrics.  We're also watching the spread of COVID and the distribution of effective vaccines very carefully and realize this may lead to continued volatility ahead. We remain confident that we can emerge from this crisis in a stronger position.  With that, we'll take your questions. And, Grace, we'll hand over to you to open the line for questions. David, why don't you take the...? Justin, let me take that. So, just to remind you of our historic mix, we have basically said that Europe is, of course, our largest region historically. If you think kind of roughly 50% or maybe a little bit more, you wouldn't be far off being correct. Asia, we said, historically, again pre-COVID, was about 20% with no single country being more than low-single digits. And that means that you've really got 30% left for US and rest of world combined. So, that is our pre-COVID mix. Obviously, that mix changed a little bit with the dynamic of what's happened recently. Obviously, the US has gone up as that's been the most recovered marketplace. So, that's the historic reference points.  In terms of last summer, we saw a couple of things. We, of course, did see, after the first wave came down, we saw people getting more confident with traveling. Of course, vaccines were still not available at that point in time. So, people were kind of traveling quite carefully and traveling locally. What we have seen and we saw in several places, what we've seen so far is a very consistent trend, that when cases come down, when vaccination rates go up, when government restrictions start to lift, good things happen. We see that happening in the US right now. We see that happening in Israel. We mentioned a couple of other areas that are doing better than the average. So, our expectation is that we'll see those positive trends start to occur in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe as things are starting to improve. As we mentioned, we are seeing things improving on April versus March and Europe is now no longer the least recovered region. I will just, Kevin, reiterate what we said and give you a little flavor, make sure you understand where the emphasis was. So, things did improve significantly sequentially in the US during the quarter, and we have positive room night growth in the US year-on-year, which is great, because, obviously, international business was still down a fair amount. When we got into March, that room night growth in the US was very strong, which I characterize that as above any of our normal growth rates. That strengthened further into April. So, very strong plus. And then if you just kind of double click down and look at just the domestic, recognizing there is some substitution effect in there, the growth rates in the US was very strong for the entire quarter, positive for each month of the quarter and getting stronger, was again stronger in April than it was in March. Mark, let me just explain that maybe in a slightly different way. So, starting with Europe, if you just look at our business within Europe, you only looked at it with that lens, you would see alternative accommodation mix in Q1 this last year up a fair amount compared to Q1 2020 and also versus Q1 of 2019. So within Europe, where we have our largest mix of alternative accommodation, we see an increase in mix. But you also remember, I said that Europe in Q1 was our lowest performing region. And of course, the highest performing region was the US where we have a much larger mix of alternative accommodation. So, that's mix effect means that, in total, our alternative accommodation mix did not increase. But in Europe, for example, where it's the largest, it did increase a fair amount. So mix effect is really the biggest region. In total, in Q1, the mix of alternative accommodations was very similar to the 30% number we gave out for all of FY 2020. But again, within different regions, there are shifts occurring. That's a good question. There are many things going on in ROI. So, yes, we did see slightly improved ROI on the paid channels. We also saw an increase in direct mix. And those two together let us have marketing grow less than bookings in the quarter. But there are many factors that go into accounting ROI, including your cost per click, conversion rate, cancellation rates, and we're still in a period of, I'd say, high volatility across all of those. So, it's not reasonable to point to any one factor as to why ROIs were up, but they were up slightly [indiscernible]. And it's only just one quarter. So, given the volatility of things happening, we wanted to point it out, but too early to call a trend. No. Chris, let me tell you about what we have talked about and see if that answers the question and then maybe we haven't got your question completely right. But just to kind of remind us where we are right now, over two thirds of our bookings are mobile, majority of those are on app. Our app booking customers are our most frequent bookers relative to other direct channels. Because always we can have a direct booking through a mobile web direct booking or through a desktop booking. And the app bookers are the most loyal and the most returning. But we really haven't gone into frequency. And also, I'd say right now, in the current environment where we're still very much recovering, frequency metrics are not the most critical ones that we focus on right now. It's more the overall top line growth rates.  But we are pleased what we're seeing with a trend towards app usage, the increase in the mix and the repeat behavior of app users. Those are all positive things for us. No, that was related to employee stock purchases. That was not buyback related. Actually, we saw a slightly lower mix of merchants in Q1 this year than in Q1 last year, both in total and at Booking.com. Because bear in mind, you're kind of comparing essentially an almost a non-crisis quarter \u2013 last year, of course, Q1, in March, things got worse, but most of the quarter was not crisis. And now you're talking about \u2013 comparing with a quarter that is very much still in the crisis with recovery mode. So, people in the short term, looking at the more flexible agency, pay the hotel model because that has just an attractive proposition in times like this when flexibility becomes very, very important. We do expect the merchant business to actually increase during the year at Booking.com where we have obviously the big mix shift happening. And we still think that the merchants business in total in 2021 will be a slightly higher mix than it was in 2020. But of course, flexibility is one of the factors that is important as people are looking at the bookings in this environment. So that's what's going on this year. Just to kind of reiterate what we said before about how it plays out in the income statements, we get additional revenue from providing the payment service. We have a variable cost related to that sitting in sales and other, which is where you see the biggest offsetting a cost element to offset \u2013 to match the revenue. There are some incremental expenses, obviously, in our other lines as well related to running the payments program, but the biggest variable cost is sitting in sales and other. As we mentioned, in 2020, the payments business operated very close to breakeven when factoring particularly variable costs into account, which is an improvement from what it was before. And it's obviously an enabler for business, as Glenn just articulated. So, we want to continue to grow the mix and maintain that breakeven profile as we're growing it out, recognizing that, in the future, we recognize there are monetization opportunities that can lead to incremental EBITDA from the payments business, which we expect, albeit at lower margin rates than core accommodations. On what's going on between the dynamic between room night growth and booking growth, a couple of factors going on here. One, I mentioned the fact that we're doing \u2013 that we're seeing better booking growth performance from flights because of volume. And also, we are doing \u2013 even though the units are down for 4% to 6% in car, there's actually fairly good increase in rates for cars. So total bookings, the TGV, has done better for both flights and cars than it did for accommodations. But the biggest factor is really what's going on with ADRs. And there has been a bit of a shift in what we've seen even in the last couple of months. And we are \u2013 saw that ADRs in the quarter were only down 1%. Now, I would say a couple of things. Now, the like-for-like ADRs are absolutely still under pressure due to lower occupancy rates. But there are some mix benefits that really impact the year-on-year comparison. The first mix benefit was the mix shift towards the US as the US really started to accelerate, particularly in March. You saw a really fast pickup in growth rates in March that we were not forecasting when we last met you. So, that was a positive for room night growth, but also for ADRs.  And also in Europe, what's happening is, right now, because there are still a lot of restrictions, people booking today are booking generally more often for the summer holiday and the summer holiday period in Europe has higher ADRs than most short-term stays. So, those two mix effects are really helping the ADR picture. And we expect this \u2013 both the phenomena that I talked about in terms of air and car and ADRs are likely to go through to Q2 as well.  But we do think the ADRs will start to be driven down again in the second half due to a couple of reasons. Again, the like-for-like ADRs are under pressure. As an example, our stay ADRs in the first quarter were down mid-teens if you exclude regional mix. That's more of a kind of like-for-like comparison. So, that like-for-like comparison is more likely to kind of be exposed in the second half. Regional mix may continue to help. But then, we do think that this earlier booking of the summer \u2013 benefit of the summer bookings will fade and the reported ADRs will become more comparable with the underlying stay ADRs and those will converge back together more in the second half than they did in the first half. So, some interesting phenomena going on with mix and with booking window in Europe driving what we're going to see in Q1 and Q2. Clearly, in a business like ours, there's always a trade-off between growth and profitability or growth and margins, particularly in the short term. And the areas that we would expect to be leaning into, there are a number of initiatives that we can drive to \u2013 lean into to drive further growth. Obviously, we need to be smart and we need to be nimble, we need to look at where the pockets of opportunity are. But we continue to be, I think, a very good marketeer in the pay channels and look at those demand opportunities and really have the opportunity to lean into those where we think we can and where we think we can actually gain incremental traffic.  We can do things with merchandising, and we can also do things with things like promotions, like back to travel. Also, there are areas like brands. So, there are multiple levers we can pull to drive growth above market where we believe there are opportunities to do so. We believe that the recovery obviously presents a very dynamic environment for everybody. And we want to make sure that we are taking advantage of opportunities that we can either make or made for us. And those are the things that would, in the short term, impact margins. Bear in mind, as we talked about what's happening this year, during periods of time when bookings are growing faster than revenue, that impacts the business because, generally, our expenses are associated upfront with capturing the booking and the revenue comes later. So those are all things that go into the dynamics around growth versus margin in the accommodation business."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you. And welcome to Booking Holdings first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.  I am pleased to start by reporting further improvement in our accommodations business, with first quarter room nights declining 54% versus Q1 2019, which was 6 percentage points better than our fourth quarter 2020 decline. This improvement was driven by solid signs of increasing travel demand in certain countries and by our team's strong execution. David will provide the details on our first quarter results in his remarks.  As we have said before, we believe that the rate of recovery for travel will depend heavily on the rate and severity of new COVID-19 cases, the timing of effective and broad-based vaccine distribution, and hopefully, even more effective treatments in the future.  While the pace of vaccine distribution remains frustratingly slow in most places around the world, Israel, the UK and the US are benefiting from successful vaccine distribution programs. In each of these countries, we have seen encouraging booking trends. We support our view that vaccine distribution is a key to unlocking pent up travel demand.  In our own survey work earlier in the year, we found that over 70% of Americans said that the early distribution stage of COVID-19 vaccines made them feel more hopeful and optimistic about traveling in 2021.  As countries ramp up vaccine distribution, which we are now starting to see in more European countries, we believe that we will start to see booking strength expand to more parts of the world.  While there are encouraging signs of recovery in some countries right now, the current situation in other countries such as India, where we are seeing staggering increases in COVID-19 cases and an enormous human tragedy happening reminds us that recovery is not underway everywhere. And unfortunately, in some countries, the situation is getting worse.  Last week, the World Health Organization warned that the pace of the pandemic is accelerating. We're mindful that governments may continue to take actions such as general area lockdowns or reintroducing travel restrictions, including barring people from high infection locations from entering the country. Any of these actions can have an impact on our performance, and it's difficult to predict when and to what extent such actions may be taken in the future.  Furthermore, international travel must recover for there to be a complete global travel recovery, and many governments may be cautious in fully opening international travel for some time.  Focusing on the US where the vaccination program is going well, I am very pleased with our first quarter results in the US and there's strong rebound in US travel demand. For Q1 in the US, we had positive room night growth versus Q1 2019 and it was our strongest performing major country. These results were driven by domestic bookings as our international business is still very slow.  We were pleased to see improvements in our US room night trends each month in Q1, and these improvements continued into April. The strength in the market benefited all of our travel products and helped drive the highest number of air tickets ever booked in a single quarter for our company. And we know that both Priceline and Booking.com had good US results during the first quarter.  In this improving environment, we continue to press ahead with one of our most important strategic strategies, strengthening the Booking.com brand in the US. You may have seen Booking.com US Back to Travel promotional campaign that we launched in April, which offered a $50 post-stay promotional travel credit for US travelers who activated the promotion in the Booking.com app and booked travel by the end of May.  This is just one example of the marketing methods that we will be employing to increase awareness of the Booking.com brand in the US. And in this case, drive further consumer engagement with our app.  We also remain focused on expanding the supply of Booking.com's alternative accommodation offering in the US and we targeted and signed new properties to the platform in the quarter. However, we recognize there's more work to be done to improve the breadth of this product in the US.  During the first quarter, we continued to execute against other key strategic priorities, such as expanding Booking.com's payment platform and building the Connected Trip vision.  Regarding our integrated payment platform at Booking.com, we've made recent progress primarily through increased adoption by our supply partners in the US. As I have mentioned previously, this platform provides payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions, and is foundational for enabling our Connected Trip strategy.  The Connected Trip is our vision of a multi-product offering including combinations, flight, ground transportation, attractions and dining, connected by our payment network, and ultimately supported by personalized intelligence to provide a frictionless, seamless experience for our bookers, all the way from first thinking about the initial booking to experiencing their trip to arriving back home.  Building out our full Connected Trips vision will be a multi-year endeavor. However, we expect that our business will benefit from the steps we are taking to achieve this vision long before reaching the ultimate end state.  For example, developing a robust flight product at Booking.com gives us the ability to engage with flight bookers early in their travel journey and allows us an opportunity to cross sell our accommodation and other services to these bookers. We have not had these opportunities historically at Booking.com, given its accommodation only focus in the past.  As we think about the journey for building the Connected Trip, this year, we'll be focused on enabling travelers to book the major elements of their trip in one place on Booking.com. This means we will be working to build up our economic combination products like flights, ground transportation and attractions by increasing supply, as well as exposing more of our customers to these products.  And Booking.com's flight offering, we are now live in 18 countries with the most recent launch in the UK. We can now expose a large segment of customers to flights as these 18 countries collectively represented more than half of Booking.com's room nights booked in 2019. Booking.com's flight offering is now fully native in the app. And while early, we are in the process of beginning to utilize marketing channels to bring potential customers to the product.  On attractions, we have continued to expand the breadth of supply available to our travelers through our recent partnership with Viator along with our ongoing partnership with Musement that was announced last year.  We see real benefits of a strong attractions offering given the potential bundling opportunities, as well as the ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination.  Of course, many of our key strategic priorities \u2013 I mentioned the app, which indicates the importance of the app for our business. We've been investing in the app platform for some time, and will continue to invest as the app becomes the center of our connected trip experience.  In addition, we see better customer loyalty, lower customer acquisition costs, and more opportunities to engage directly with travelers through our app. Booking.com was the most downloaded travel app globally in the first quarter, according to a leading third party research firm. We now see over two-thirds of our bookings come through the mobile devices, a majority of which are on the app. One of Booking Holdings' goals is to do well in the area of sustainability. I was very pleased to recently make public our 2020 sustainability report. And one achievement that I am particularly proud of is Booking Holdings becoming operationally carbon neutral in 2020. This is a significant milestone for our business, and one we were working towards even prior to the pandemic. We intend to remain carbon neutral in our operations in the future and look forward to making progress on our sustainability strategy, including diversity and inclusion and sustainable travel. In conclusion, the exact shape and timing of the full recovery for travel remains uncertain. However, I am encouraged by the signs of recovery we are seeing in some countries, and I'm confident that we will eventually see a strong recovery in travel demand globally.  That being said, we are likely to experience volatility between now and then, with some countries recovering well, others beginning to recover, and unfortunately, some getting worse.  I'm proud of the actions that our teams across Booking Holdings continue to take to strengthen our company's position and execute against our strategic priorities. We are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. We are focused on building a larger and faster growing business that generates more earnings into the recovery and for the long run.  I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. As I said, I'm very pleased with the Q1 results in the US. I mentioned both Priceline.com and Booking.com doing well. So, we are very happy about that. I don't have \u2013 we're not done with the quarter yet. So, we don't have industrywide numbers to go against. So, I'm just going to say that I'm pleased with what we're producing and we'll see everybody's reported how we did. Why don't I talk generally about strategy and then, David, if he wants \u2013 I'm not sure he wants to disclose anything more about specific numbers and gains. I will say this. I've said this in several calls in the past, actually many, about increasing our performance in the US is a strategic priority. And we have said that we under index in the US. So, we are doing many, many things to try and improve that. And everything from the basics of making sure we have the right selections of properties that people want to making sure it's the right price, making sure we're competitive. I talked about how we had to have the US payments platform up and running for Booking.com, so we can do creative, new things such as our back to travel promo, which of course wasn't in Q1, but just another example of things that we're doing.  And there's a lot of just blocking and tackling done by both teams, Priceline.com and the people at Booking.com, working with our suppliers, coming up with ways that we can help them get more customers. So, it's so many different things. There's no one thing to say that was the silver bullet. And I expect that we will be able to continue to do this. I hope to be able to continue to do this in the future. It will remain a priority for us. And, David, if you want to talk about numbers. Well, we just put it out. Still an opportunity still to book on that one. It goes till the end of May for US people. They can still do a book, but they had to do the \u2013 in April, they had to actually activate it. So, we don't have a lot of [indiscernible] to tell you what we think that's going to be. It certainly is something that \u2013 it's one different thing that I pointed out, not because a huge driver, but just an example of things that we haven't done in the past that we will do in the future. And in fact, you may have noticed it, we started a very similar, but not exactly the same program in the UK yesterday. Or maybe it's two days ago.  The point being that we're trying to be more creative and going forward coming up with different ways to bring those customers to us, show them what a great product we have, great service we have and make sure they come back to us in the future, albeit not with the promotion. Mark, I'll answer your question first about the general, what I expect in the future, and I'll let \u2013 it was Dave that talked about the mix and he can talk about \u2013 because we have more in Europe and it's the US, and I'll let him go through that [indiscernible] why we are where we are.  In terms of the future, here's the situation. We've been seeing for many, many years \u2013 and everyone's aware of this \u2013 that people have been more interested in the alternative accommodation. This is a global phenomenon. It's been going up at a steady rate for some time. COVID created a step functional change where people who may never have thought about an alternative accommodations, now they're thinking I want to go to a home that's not near people, maybe near the beach or near the mountains and I feel safer there. Now, having tried that, in the future, the question is you just asked is, will people go back to their former habits of some people going to hotels, some people homes and it will be a more gradual increase and will be a drop back first and then back up? I don't think anybody really knows.  But I would make the guess that people having tried the alternative accommodations during the pandemic will forever have it in their consideration set. And they may not always use it, they will choose what type of property fits their needs. But now, because it is part of their consideration set, I think there is a functional change in increased mix in the long run. That being said, for us, we do both. We have the greatest selection of both hotels and non-hotel accommodations together combined. So, we feel we are very well positioned globally for that. Though I have spoken in the past, in some regions, we are definitely in sufficient supply that we need to build up.  And David, do you want to explain again about the issue because of mix in terms of geographies and the mix in properties? David, I don't know if you ever disclosed anything in terms of frequency on the app? We don't give away \u2013 I don't believe we ever talked about the actual attach rates. But I will say that that is an important reason we do flights and that getting that booker upfront is important, so that we can then get them to buy something that will have a higher margin.  The 18 countries in the Booking.com is now working in, we are getting initial \u2013 and we've been doing it for some time now, obviously, I guess a year now approximately. We are getting some learnings, how can we improve it, how can we make it better? We really haven't marketed this at all in terms of the way we market our hotels offering because we want to get it right before we start spending a lot of money. We don't want to waste money as you know.  I am very pleased, though, with the very limited effort that we've done that people are using it and we are getting feedback that people are coming back. So, that's good. It's something that's important for the long run. And I want to emphasize how much this is a long game we're playing here because, as you know, the number is still very, very, very small and this is very early. But we hope in the long run that this connected trip, which is not just the flights, but it's also the ground transportation and the attractions and the dining, all the things that people do when they are traveling, to create something that makes them want to always use our app more than anything else. When they think of travel, they come back to us. So, it's critical that we have that first thing, which is important to a lot of people, flights. And we're going to continue to make investments into it to make sure that is absolutely a great, great service. We recognize that's where the eyeballs are going. So, we need to make sure that we are putting our name appropriately in front. So, people when they think of travel, they think of us. So we are cognizant of that fact and we are we are working on that. So yes, we will continue to work with that. Dave, why don't you talk to about agency/merchant question and I'll talk about the long vision on payments. In the long view, we'd like to get as much business as possible on payments because we believe we'll create a better service for both our customers for traveling and our supplier partners to be able to do all sorts of things you can't do when it's just a straight agency play. And we believe we can provide value to everyone in that way. And I gave that example earlier about \u2013 we couldn't do a back to trial promotion if we didn't have a payment product to do that. And there are many ways we're going to be able to merchandise people's \u2013 our supplier partners, different ways to merchandise their offerings in ways that you can really only do well with a payment platform. And, of course, putting things together, bundling, all different things. So obviously, we would like to get as many people in because it's good for everybody who comes into it, both the customer and the supplier. That being said, we know that we'll never get to 100%. There will be \u2013 still be lots of people who will say, all I need is hotel, I like this agency thing, I pay the desk, it's all fine, we'll see if that happens, whatever. But even in that situation, we may actually do the payment for the hotel in a way that we can save them money. So it's a great opportunity for us. But it's the long view and it's going to take some time to get there. I'll take the first and, Dave, why don't you take the second? So, in terms of the alternative accommodations in the States, the things you mentioned are very, very important. We've got to have the right properties for the customer. And I've talked about this in the past that we under-index with the private homes, the single homes in the States. And that has been a popular product in the States because of the pandemic. And that's something that we are continuing to work on in the future. It's also just the process in general, how we get people on board, who we're dealing with to get them to come in. And we currently are using the multi-product property managers more than, say, some of our competitors who go out and get individual properties. So, there's a difference in how we're doing it right now.  I do believe this is a very, very achievable goal to be as competitive as anybody else. As David mentioned earlier about mix, we do a great business in Europe in the alternative accommodations area. A very good business. And there's no reason we shouldn't be able to do the exact same thing here in the States, though it is taking time. I'll start with the second part, labor. And I'll let David go back to margins and how things can look as we continue to go for the future. So, certainly, we've all read news articles about shortages right now popping up in different areas of the hospitality industry. And some of the leaders in the industry, particularly some of the hotels and restaurants saying just can't get workers. But I don't believe that's going to impact where people aren't going to be able to find a place to stay at all. Right now, there is no shortage in my mind of great places for people to go to. And I don't see that happening. Yes, some property types may be short at certain times during high season, particularly, some of the very popular areas in the summer as leisure comes back in some parts of the world. But overall for the business, I don't see this as a significant or even a small risk to the business at all.  And Dave, you can talk a little bit about margin. Thank you. So, in closing, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to navigate through these better, though still difficult times, and we want to continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, and please be safe. Good night."

And now I\u2019d like to introduce Booking Holdings\u2019 speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings\u2019 fourth quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report a strong finish to 2022 as we delivered fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4 billion and $1.2 million respectively, which were both ahead of our previous expectations. Room night growth versus 2019 of 10% in the fourth quarter improved from 8% growth in Q3. And for the first time, we saw room nights across four of our major regions above 2019 levels for the quarter, which was another important milestone for our recovery. Room night growth trends have further strengthened in 2023, with January room nights up 26% compared to 2019 or up about 60% year-over-year. We are very encouraged by the continued strength and resiliency of travel demand last year and into the new year which speaks to consumers\u2019 strong desire to travel. However, as we stated last year, month-on-month trends can be volatile and we recognize that there is uncertainty regarding the future path of the world\u2019s economy. And David will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and on the recent trends we have been seeing in 2023. Looking back at the full year of 2022, I am proud of our company\u2019s performance during what was a challenging and very competitive environment. Our customers booked an all-time high of nearly 900 million room nights on our platforms in 2022, which was an improvement of 52% versus 2021 and 6% higher than in 2019. Gross bookings of $121 billion exceeded the $100 billion mark for the first time in our history and increased 58% versus 2021 and 26% versus 2019 or 73% and 36% on a constant currency basis. These are record levels per room night and gross bookings were achieved despite travel restrictions still in place in many parts of the world at the onset of 2022. And I note that most of Asia did not begin to open until towards the end of the year and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine negatively impacted our business. In terms of our P&L last year, we reached a new revenue record of slightly more than $17 billion, which was 56% higher than 2021 and 13% higher than 2019 or up about 71% and 24% on a constant currency basis, respectively. We achieved this strong top line result while improving our profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 billion, increasing 82% versus 2021 and margins expanding by 4 percentage points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was 10% below the 2019 levels. However, on a constant currency basis, it was actually 6% higher after accounting for the FX headwinds we faced in 2022. I believe these results demonstrate that we are making significant progress against our goal to build a larger and faster growing business that generates more earning dollars than it did prior to the pandemic. While there is more work to be done to achieve this long-term goal, I am encouraged by the progress we have seen so far. Regarding our long-term outlook for travel, we are pleased with the positioning of our business and are positive about the future. This, coupled with our strong balance sheet, led us to return $6.5 billion to shareholders during 2022 by purchasing our shares. At year end, our share count was 8% lower versus the prior year and returning capital to shareholders will remain a high priority for the company going forward. David will provide further thoughts on our approach in his remarks. In addition to our strong financial results in 2022, we made meaningful progress against the key strategic priorities that I highlighted on our earnings call 2 years ago. These are expanding payments at Booking.com, building out our connected trip capabilities, and strengthening our position in the U.S. market. Let me address the progress we have made in each of these areas. On payments, in the fourth quarter, we processed 42% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings on a merchant basis and are pleased with our progress in this area. As mentioned in the past, moving Booking.com\u2019s model from agent to merchant drives important benefits for both our supplier partners and our travelers. For our supplier partners, offering a payment solution adds value in several key ways, including providing access to additional traveler demand by enabling alternative payment methods, reducing cancellations, decreasing operational workloads and enabling fraud protection. For our travelers, Booking.com\u2019s platform allows many consumers to pay how they want to pay and we believe ultimately helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience. On the connected trip, on our long-term vision is to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. We have expanded our offering into travel verticals other than accommodations with a focus on flights. And in the future, we will work to link relevant travel components together to provide a more seamless and flexible booking and travel experience. We believe that as a result of this initiative and the improved consumer experience we will drive increases in customer engagement and loyalty to our platform over time. We have continued to make progress on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com, which is now available in over 50 countries. This flight offering gives us the ability to help our consumers book another important component of their travel in one place on our platform and allows us to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their travel discovery process. We continue to see that over 20% of all of our flight bookers globally are new to Booking.com. We will continue this important work to provide our customers the best possible trip experience we can offer. In the U.S., both our Priceline and Booking.com brands continue to execute well and contributed to U.S. room night growth of almost 30% and gross bookings growth of about 60% in 2022 versus 2019. On our volume and consumer spend basis, we have grown our U.S. business to be meaningfully larger than it was prior to the pandemic. And we believe that our growth rate has outpaced the recovery in the broader market for U.S. accommodations, which means we believe we gained market share. At Booking.com, we have taken steps to improve our offering in the U.S. by utilizing marketing to improve awareness of our brand, introducing and ramping up our flight target, scaling adoption of payments and working closely with our combination partners to ensure we are delivering incremental value to them. We are encouraged by our achievements in strengthening our positioning in the U.S., but there is much more work ahead as we continue to execute against this priority over the long-term. In terms of our core accommodation business, we continue to drive benefits for our traveler customers and for our supply partners. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. For example, as I mentioned earlier, payments brings an important benefit to our partners. In the area of alternative accommodations, Booking.com alternative accommodation room nights for the full year grew about 56% versus 2021 and about 11% versus 2019 and represented about 30% of Booking.com\u2019s total room nights. During the year, we made progress with our alternative accommodation offering for the full spectrum of property types by rolling out an enhanced payment solution for professionals, launching partner liability insurance, introducing a damage policy and piloting request-to-book functionality, which is an important feature for some individual partners. We have seen improvements in the time to first booking and better retention rates for new partners. At the same time, we are incorporating our alternative accommodation offering in some of our recent brand advertising to help raise awareness, customer awareness of this product. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product offering to our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the United States. We remain focused on building a better experience for our customers and increasing loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest level ever in the fourth quarter. Our goal over time is to further increase our direct mix through several initiatives, including continued efforts to enhance the benefits of our Genius loyalty program, further building out our connected trip vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app. The mobile app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. And ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. About 45% of our room nights were booked through apps for the year, which is about 13 percentage points higher than in 2019. For 2022, Booking.com\u2019s app remained the number one downloaded OTA app globally, and for the first time, moved into the number one position in the U.S. according to one of the leading third-party research firms. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. We believe providing attractive prices on accommodations, is very important as we aim to deliver value to our travelers. Our first priority, as we think about providing attractive prices is to work directly with our supply partners to source competitive rates. In addition to sourcing competitive rates directly from our partners, we have built up our ability to selectively offer discounts and incentives at Booking.com over the last few years. This ability to merchandise is another lever that we can now pull as we look to deliver value to our customers when we cannot directly access the most competitive pricing. We have been pleased with the levels of incremental return we have seen in 2022 from merchandising and we will continue to selectively utilize this tool going forward. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the progress our teams have made in delivering strong results in 2022, while executing against our key strategic priorities. These initiatives will help us deliver a better offering and experience for our customers and partners which strengthens both sides of our marketplace. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunity ahead for our company. Now, before I turn the call over to David, I want to share the news that David has let us know that he plans to retire from his role as CFO in early 2024, after which he will be involved with us for up to 2 more years to help initially with the transition and then with other projects and initiatives as needed. As you can see by this timeline, he is not going anywhere for quite some time. So now, let me turn the call over to David. David?\nDavid Goulden: Thank you for those comments, Glenn. And as you said, I am not going anywhere for some time over the next year in my CFO role and when involved beyond that, I will remain as focused as ever on continuing to help deliver strong results from the business and creating value for our stakeholders. Now turning to our results. I will review our results for the fourth quarter and provide some color on the trends we have seen so far in the first quarter and our thoughts on 2023. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-on-year basis unless otherwise indicated, but we will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to the fourth quarter. We are encouraged to see room night growth of 10% in the fourth quarter, up from 8% room night growth in the third quarter, with the improvement driven by Asia and the U.S. For the fourth quarter, the U.S. was up more than 35%, rest of world was at 110%, and Europe and Asia were both up mid single-digits. Q4 was the first quarter of room night growth in Asia versus 2019. Our growth in total room nights on a year-on-year basis increased from 31% in Q3 to 39% in Q4. Our mobile apps represented over 45% of our total room nights in the fourth quarter and about 45% for the full year. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year relative to 2021 and 2019. The international mix of our total room nights in Q4 was about 48%, which was higher than Q3, but still a few percentage points below Q4 2019. Our cancellation rate was slightly above 2019 levels in Q4, but were slightly below 2019 levels for the full year. In Q4, the booking window of Booking.com remained shorter than in 2019 similar to what we saw in the third quarter of 2022. This booking window expanded meaningfully versus the fourth quarter of 2021 when we saw a higher mix of near-term bookings during the COVID-19 Omicron variant wave. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our room night growth rate was about 15% in Q4 versus 2019 and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 29%, which was a couple of percentage points higher than Q4 2019 and Q4 2021. Q4 gross bookings increased 32% versus 2019 or 47% on a constant currency basis. The 32% increase in gross bookings was 22 percentage points better than the 10% room night increase due to 29% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to 5 points from strong flight bookings across the group partially offset by 15 percentage points of negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about 1 percentage point from regional mix and about 28 percentage points from rate increase across all our regions. Despite the higher ADRs in the fourth quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or change in length of stay that could indicate that customers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up about 2.9% versus a small base in 2019 and up about 61% versus 2021 driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com\u2019s flight products. Revenue for the fourth quarter was up 21% versus 2019 and up about 35% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points below Q4 2019 and was about in line with our expectations. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q4 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 32% versus Q4 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with our expectations and with Q4 2019. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points compared with Q4 2021 and was in line with our expectations. About 42% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q4, up from about 30% in Q4 2021. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 24% versus Q4 2021, which was higher than our expectations primarily due to changes in FX in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was over $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which was 3% below 2019 and would have been around 16% above 2019 on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP net income of $957 million results in non-GAAP EPS of about $25 a share, which was up 6% versus Q4 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of over $1.2 billion in the quarter, which included a $240 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of our office building for Booking.com\u2019s future headquarters in a sale leaseback transaction as well as $179 million unrealized gain in our equity investments, primarily related to Meituan, JD and Grab. When looking at the full year, we are pleased to report that our 2022 room nights were 6% higher than 2019 and our gross bookings were 26% higher and about 36% higher on a constant currency basis. Our full year revenue was over $17 billion, which was 13% above 2019 and up about 24% on a constant currency basis. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.1% in 2022, which was lower than the 15.6% in 2019 due to almost a full point negative impact from timing, about 40 basis points from the slow recovery in our advertising and other revenues, which have no associated gross bookings and about 30 basis points from an increased mix in flights. The benefit of take rates in 2022 from increased revenue from payments was offset by our increased investments in merchandising, each of which impacted our reported take rates by about 1 percentage point in 2022 compared to about 0.5 percentage point each in 2019. These changes in payments revenue and merchandising costs versus 2019 are mainly at Booking.com. Our full year adjusted EBITDA was about $5.3 billion, which was 10% below 2019 and up about 6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31%, which was 4 points higher than our EBITDA margin in 2021 and better than our expectations for a few points higher at the start of the year. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash investment balance of $15.2 billion was up versus our Q3 ending balance of $11.8 billion driven primarily by the $3.6 billion bond offering we completed in Q4, the $2.1 billion of free cash flow generated in the quarter, and about $600 million in proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction I mentioned previously. This increase in our cash balance was partially offset by about $2.3 billion in share repurchases in Q4 and by the payment of about $780 million in November debt maturity. For the full year 2022, we generated almost $6.2 billion in free cash flow, which was 38% higher than in 2019. We repurchased over $6.5 billion of our shares in the year and reducing our year end share count by 8% versus 2021 and by 22% over the last 5 years. We are proud of this accomplishment, because it reflects both our commitment to return capital to shareholders and how carefully we have managed our stock-based compensation expense and its dilutive impact. We continue to see many publicly traded companies pro forma out the very real expense associated with stock-based compensation. We strongly disagree with this approach, and therefore, every profit metric we report includes the negative impact of stock-based compensation expense. We view SBC expense as a very real cost of doing business across every stakeholder should fully count when evaluating the performance and returns of our business or any business. If anything, we view SBC dollars even more valuable than cash dollars because of our long-term expectation that dollars worth of stock to-date will be worth more in the future. It\u2019s the same expectation that serves as the rationale for pursuing our share repurchase program, a program that has meaningfully reduced our share count over time has not just served to offset dilution from SBC. Simply offsetting dilution does not represent a return on capital to shareholders, but actually represents a cash drain on our business that does not get counted in many companies\u2019 pro forma reporting of profits. In 2022, our stock-based compensation resulted in less than 0.7% of shareholder dilution. And during the last 5 years, it resulted in less than 3% of cumulative dilution. As I mentioned, during the same period, we reduced total share count by a net 22%, inclusive of the shares that were added as a result of our stock-based compensation activities. Our future practices will continue to be guided by the same two philosophical approaches that guide us decades, namely, number one, the stock-based compensation counts; and two, that our stock repurchases, first and foremost, are meant \u2013 are actively meant to return capital to shareholders in the form of share count reductions. In January, we started to sell down our investment in Meituan and completed the sale of our position in February. Total proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale, represents a $1.2 billion or over 250% increase in the value of our regional investments. On an after-tax basis, we expect this to increase our available cash position by about $1.4 billion. Our business partnership with Meituan continues. As we think about our capital structure and allocation framework going forward, we are focused on growing returns for our shareholders whilst appropriately investing in our business and maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings. We will target maintaining a gross leverage ratio of about 2%, which is about in line with the historic levels. On a net leverage basis, we have started to run the business with negative net leverage. However, we plan on moving gradually through addition our positive net leverage targeting about 1x net leverage over time. We believe managing our capital structure with these targets will allow us to maintain our strong investment grade credit ratings whilst also generating additional capacity for returning capital to shareholders as our EBITDA increases. Given these considerations and our current outlook for the business, we expect our annual total return on capital to shareholders to be at least equal to our free cash flow over the next few years. In 2019, we started the year with $4.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase organization that was approved in the prior year. And in the second quarter 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new $15 billion authorization. Since the start of 2019, we repurchased the full $4.5 billion under prior authorization and have repurchased $11.1 billion under the $15 billion authorization, leaving us with $3.9 billion remaining at the end of last year. We are announcing today that our Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $20 billion that we will begin utilizing after we complete the current authorization. We expect to complete the share repurchases under the cumulative $24 billion authorization within the next 4 years, assuming that travel continues to recover and grow from here. Before I turn to 2023, I\u2019d like to remind you we will primarily compare 2023 with 2022. However, there will be some periods where a comparison to 2019 will be helpful to better understand the trends of the business. For example, comparing January 2023 versus 2019 helps avoid the distortion created by \u2013 from comparing to January \u201822, which was negatively impacted by the Omicron variant. As you recall, our January 2022 room nights were 21% below 2019, but it\u2019s quickly improved and February was in line with February 2019. So, now on to recent trends and our thoughts for the first quarter of 2023, in January, we booked over 95 million room nights, our highest monthly amount ever and about 10 million more room nights than our previous monthly record set last May. January 2023 room nights were up 60% on a year-on-year basis. This compares to Q4 2022 room night growth of 39% on a year-on-year basis. When comparing January 2023 with January 2019, room nights were up 26%, a very nice improvement from the 10% growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement in growth rates versus 2019 from Q4 January was driven primarily by Europe, rest of world and Asia. January room night growth versus 2019 was about 35% in the U.S., over 25% in Europe and rest of the world and over 20% in Asia. In January, we saw lower cancellation rates versus 2019. Additionally, we have seen the booking window fully normalized back to 2019 levels in January. And in some regions, it has expanded as we see a healthy mix of near-term bookings as well as bookings to stay late in the year. We also continue to see no change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that customers are trading down despite ADRs continuing to be higher than in 2019. The average length of stay of transaction booked in January continued to be a bit longer than it was in 2019. January likely saw some benefit from bookings that were made in the month \u2013 instead of December last year or potentially later in this year. This may indicate the room night growth could moderate from these levels going forward as some of these booking pattern differences normalize. On a year-on-year basis, January gross bookings were up 74% or up 83% on a constant currency basis. The 74% increase in gross bookings is 14 percentage points higher than 60% room night growth due to 13% higher constant currency ADRs and also due to a few points from flight booking partially offset by 9 percentage points of negative impact from FX movements. Gross bookings in January were up 55% versus 2019 or up 72% on a constant currency basis. While there continues to be uncertainty around the month-to-month trends, our comments for the first quarter made the assumption that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be over 30% year-on-year. Compared to 2019, this will be just over 20%, assuming some moderation in growth from what we have seen over the last few weeks. We expect Q4 gross bookings to grow about 4 percentage points faster than room nights on a year-on-year basis due to about 6% higher constant currency ADRs and a couple of points from continued flight bookings partially offset by about 6 points from FX. We expect Q1 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 10.3%, a 40 basis point improvement from Q1 2019 due to a less negative impact on timing, partially offset by increased investments in merchandising and a higher mix of clients. We expect Q1 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly lower in Q1 than in Q1 2022 due to increase in direct mix. Marketing and merchandising combined, as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1, will be a little higher than in Q1 2022, but for the full year, we expect them to be about in line with last year. We expect Q1 sales and other expenses as potential gross bookings to be about 30 basis points higher than in Q1 2022 due to higher gross merchant bookings mix and higher third-party core costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q1 to grow just over 20% versus Q1 2022 due to higher personnel and related expenses, indirect taxes and IT expenses. Taking all this into account, we expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be over $600 million, which will represent a more than 93% increase versus Q1 2022. As we think about the full year ahead, we\u2019re encouraged by the strong trends we\u2019re seeing in Q1 so far. However, we do expect continued volatility in our top line trends, which makes it very difficult to predict how the top line will progress during the year and how the full year will turn out. Assuming a moderation in growth from current levels and taking into account the more difficult comparisons as we move through the year, our full year commentary assumes low-teens gross booking growth versus 2022. Of course, it\u2019s early in the year, but this is our best estimate at this point in time. For the full year, we expect our 2023 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 50 basis points higher than in 2022, which will result in year-over-year revenue growth is higher than our year-over-year gross bookings growth. We expect the negative impact on timing to mostly go away in 2023, and we also expect that our payments mix will continue to add to take rates. Partly offsetting these are continued increases in the mix of flights in our business, an increase in merchandising spend versus 2022. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as the percentage of gross bookings will be about the same as in 2022. We expect our more fixed expenses in 2023 to grow about 20%, which is similar to the growth last year. We expect these more fixed expenses to grow more slowly in future years. As a result, we expect to deliver a record level of EBITDA in 2023 while continue to expand our EBITDA margins by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our Q4 results and the early trends we\u2019re seeing in 2023. We remain confident that our strategic priorities will enable us to provide better services for our travels and partners. We continue to remain focused on building a larger and faster-growing business than we have pre-COVID that delivers more and faster growing EBITDA dollars and more and faster growing earnings per share with industry-leading EBITDA margins. We will now move to Q&A. So Chris, can you please open the lines?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Nowak, Morgan Stanley. Brian, please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulations, David. I have two questions, one sort of blocking and tackling and one big picture. Just the first blocking and tackling one, as you\u2019re thinking about the low teens gross bookings for this year, can you just sort of walk us through how you\u2019re thinking about your best guess or your base case on ADRs around that model? Then the second one, kind of more big picture. There is a lot of discussion or speculation about search and potentially travel search becoming more sophisticated because of new AI tools. How do you think about Booking.com\u2019s position in that world and sort of the ability to continue to grow the percentage of business that\u2019s direct if the search model becomes a little more comprehensive? Thanks.\nDavid Goulden: Okay, Brian. Thank you. Let me take the first one and then hand over to Glenn for the second one. So Yes, there are a few puts and takes, obviously, as we think about the entire year. To answer your question, we expect that our room night growth will be slightly lower than the low teens gross booking growth. we will get a little bit of help from FX. We will get a little bit of help from flights. But we think that across the year, as the ADR compare gets harder and we got more recovery in Asia that impacts geo mix, we will see a little bit of pressure on constant currency ADRs for the full year.\nGlenn Fogel: Brian, why don\u2019t I take the second one. Obviously, a lot of hype about AI right now, about generative AI. And I guess hike is a good word when we talk about are we on the Gartner hike cycle right now. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019re into that froth of dissolution yet. I think we\u2019re still probably in the peak of inflated expectations, but there is no doubt this technology has seems to be accelerating all the time. And I think you may be limiting the question on those because it\u2019s not just how is AI going to impact search down the road, it\u2019s just AI in general. And we have been talking about this for some time always. I happened to be listening to our call from 3 years ago. And I talked about what we are doing \u2013 AI. I talked about our [indiscernible] center, I talked about the things we\u2019re doing, how important it was to develop our machine learning capabilities and all the things that we do and Booking Holding\u2019s using AI to improve the product, improve what we\u2019re presenting to our customers, working with our partners better using AI. So there is a tremendous amount of interest, of course, in all these areas and some of the stuff we see is very interesting. But I think it\u2019s going to take some time \u2013 but something \u2013 there is going to be major changes in your specific question about search, no doubt it\u2019s going to make it better. In terms of your question, how are we going to be positioned for these changes, I think the best thing anybody could do is look back at the past. There is been lots of technology changes since we first started our business over 20 years ago. And as those changes happened, we adapted and developed. We did great when, for example, people went from just desktop to mobile. And we were very good coming out with these new AI machine learning tools to be able to predict what would be best for our customer. I would say that our capabilities are as good as anybody else\u2019s and we will adapt and do very well with these new technologies. So I am confident in the future, and I am not scared, I\u2019m actually encouraged by being able to use all of these new tools to provide a better service for both sides of the marketplace.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney, Evercore. Mark, please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Let me ask two questions, please. The China outbound question, Glenn, just \u2013 that will take a while, but that is been a massive market historically. I think it\u2019s the largest outbound travel market. And I know it was a small single-digit percentage, mid single digit percentage, whatever, back in 2019. Your thoughts on how to position the company to maybe better tap into that now than you were able to a couple of years ago? And then is there another U.S. out there? What I mean by that is you\u2019ve talked about leaning into gaining market share gains in the U.S. Is there another region where you think you kind of underpunch your weight, if I said that right, and can also apply the U.S. playbook to also gain better share in that market? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Thanks, Mark. In regards to China, obviously, there is a lot of excitement about China, too, dropping the restrictions in terms of being able to travel due to COVID, getting everybody very excited about what does that mean. And not just for travel, of course, just reducing those restrictions is increasing GDP in China and what that\u2019s going to do in terms of demand for all sorts of things and what\u2019s that\u2019s going to do to inflation, and how is it going to impact the rest of the world economies. In terms of your specific question, you\u2019re correct. We were a small player in terms of the overall Chinese travel business before the pandemic. In terms of the future, yes, there is an opportunity there, and there are a lot of outbound travelers who definitely are hoping that they can go outbound and travel soon. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen nearly as quickly as I think some deals have been predicting. When you look at some of the numbers out of January in terms of the amount of outbound airlift available was a teens number, I think maybe it was 15% of what it was in 2019 in terms of the actual lift that you can get out of China. So I think it\u2019s going to take some time for that. Now in terms of how we can take advantage of the increase that is going to happen in future, we\u2019re going to use pretty much the same placement we use pretty much everywhere, albeit China is a little different because there is not Google there. But in terms of marketing, meaning people are aware of all the great products that we offer and be able to competitive pricing, all things any consumer cares about, whether you\u2019re in China, Europe, U.S. or wherever in the world, we will keep doing those things. I know it\u2019s not \u2013 China is a very competitive market. And it\u2019s going to take some time. And as we said when we talked about our priorities, you\u2019ll note that we take U.S. I don\u2019t say China, but I would like to be able to say, look, we have been able to be successful in gaining market share in the U.S. over the last few years. I think everybody can see those numbers. So \u2013 yes, we will try and do better than we did in the past in China, but I don\u2019t think anybody should start going to the bank with any expectations of significant improvements anytime in the near-term. What\u2019s your second question or was that \u2013 that was second question?\nMark Mahaney: No. No. Is there another U.S.? So is there \u2013 not Europe, but is there another regional market where you think your market share probably isn\u2019t where you want it to be, and you can use U.S. learnings to expand share in that market?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, we want to increase our market share everywhere, of course. The reason we kept calling out the U.S., the U.S. very similar to Europe in many ways. And we had noticed how underindexed we were there. That\u2019s not quite the same case when we look around the world, albeit in right now, except in China, which we noted. We do fairly well in a lot of parts of the world, but there is nothing that we pull out separately and say, hey, here\u2019s another area where we\u2019re going to really press hard to try and do better at. We\u2019ve kind of do what we\u2019ve been doing throughout the world for a long time, it\u2019s gaining share everywhere.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks, Glenn and congratulations, David.\nDavid Goulden: Mark, thank you. Just to add to comments. Relative to what we\u2019re seeing in January, we saw obviously a nice improvement in the Asia region compared to Q4. That is not being driven by China. That\u2019s been driven by the other markets in the Asia region. China is a small contributor to that improvement so far.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley, UBS. Lloyd, please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks, guys. If I heard you right, you talked to, I think, 50 bps of revenue take rate improvement this year. How much of that is kind of the timing headwind unwinding? What are kind of some other puts and takes we should think about impacting revenue take rates this year? And as we think about \u201824 and growth continues to normalize, is that \u2013 is there another 50 bps in take rate just from that kind of timing unwind? You talked about the 1% headwind to \u201822. And then the second one, I guess, you\u2019ve been picking up share in the U.S. for a while now. Can you talk about just how repeat business is coming in and specifically repeat direct is coming in as that kind of cohort of users starts to age in the U.S.? And maybe how that compares to historical levels? Anything you can share there would be great. Thanks.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Lloyd, let me take the first part of that. So I think I kind of went through a little bit of this in the commentary, but there is a lot of numbers in the commentary with all the comparisons of versus last year versus 2019, etcetera. So relative to the 50 bps of improvement this year, essentially, the timing drag on take rates last year has basically gone \u2013 almost entirely gone away. So there was about a point of timing last year that goes away. And also, we get a little bit of an increase from payments as payment mix increases. The offsetting amount to those get you to the plus 50 is that we have continuing this year at the same level of merchandise we exited last year out, broadly speaking. So you get a year-on-year impact of merchandising that\u2019s a negative and flight mix as well. So that\u2019s how you get to the cap plus 50 improvement from last year. So to your question on 2024 though, the timing impact has really gone away at this point in time compared to 2019, a lot less, of course, growth rate change, much more than expected during the year. So essentially, there are puts and takes along the lines. The same thing I talked about, payments, merchandising, flights, etcetera. But we don\u2019t expect major changes in the take rate level from where we are right now. You shouldn\u2019t be modeling big changes in to take rates because we have some things helping and we have some things that are hurting, and they are generally going to offset each of that broadly speaking at this point in time.\nGlenn Fogel: We don\u2019t go regional in terms of your question there. We are not going to be talking about in the U.S. in terms of steps that you are asking for.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay. Any directional sense of just how you\u2019re feeling about the aging cohorts in the market share gains you\u2019ve had just broadly?\nGlenn Fogel: No, I\u2019m not going to be specific in terms of that. I just would say how pleased I am. We\u2019ve been talking about it for some time on these calls about what we\u2019re doing in the U.S. and gaining share and the reasons that we\u2019re doing, how we\u2019re doing it, and I\u2019m just I\u2019ll just reiterating how pleased we are to be able to do that, and we\u2019re going to keep on grinding the way to continue to try and gain share.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Post, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Justin, please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Thank you. Maybe one for David and one for Glenn, David, it looks like you\u2019re getting your EBITDA back towards the 33%, maybe 33.5% range this year in guidance. How do you think about where you are now versus pre pandemic? And what are the levers going forward? And then, Glenn, I think you said AA nights were about 29% of total and that\u2019s kind of flattish with last year. How are you thinking about your alternative accommodation business? And to the extent you can talk about it, obviously, competitive concerns, what are your big initiatives for that business this year? Thank you.\nDavid Goulden: Alright. Just let me take the EBITDA margin question first. So if we add a couple of points to where we are in \u201822 to \u201823, the drivers between that, the difference between that, the 39 points we were at in 2019, are basically a few things. One, we\u2019re leaning in more relative to marketing and merchandising that we did in 2019, that\u2019s very conscious to continue to gain share in the recovering market. We\u2019ve got the mix of lower-margin business. We said that flights and payments will start to have an impact as they grow and they are making part of the difference. We\u2019ve got some targeted OpEx investments in \u2013 when you look at our total OpEx expense vis-\u00e0-vis 2019, we\u2019ve got DST and we\u2019ve got FX. I mean, I don\u2019t know their impact \u2013 rough order of impact. That\u2019s how you kind of get to the 6 points of difference. So when you think about where we would go going forward from that, we do expect to be able to increase even the margins from this level. We\u2019re not trying to get back to COVID, pre-COVID volume levels, I just want to be super clear, but we do think there is still some growth potential from where we are right now. And the drivers of that, if you think of the things I just mentioned, are the reasons we\u2019re down below versus 2019 now. The drivers of that, that we think we can use to our advantage over time is that as our direct mix increases, we should be able to kind of lean in less in total to our margin spend. We may lean in to the same level in absolute terms on paid marketing, but paid market becomes a smaller part of the business. We do believe that over time, we can get more leverage on our fixed costs. But then we do expect to see continued pressure from the lower mix \u2013 from the higher mix of lower-margin businesses that will continue to grow. We believe that over the kind of medium term, we can still increase margins from where we are today into 2023. But again, not back to the 2019 levels.\nGlenn Fogel: Regarding the alternative accommodation space, we are very pleased with what we\u2019re doing in growing. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the things that we did last year and I will repeat them all, but those are the things that we\u2019re doing to make sure that partners, that suppliers, they want to put their properties on to our platform. And that\u2019s the first thing. And having done that and doing that right now is that how do we get the awareness. So you noticed, for example, our Super Bowl ad, where we do include the non-hotel accommodation in that and make sure as we grow that branding throughout the year to make sure people are aware. It\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s not anything that is magic is making a product that people want to use and making a product that people who own properties want to put on our platform and then putting in the marketing to push it through. It has increased. It has not increased substantially over the years as our hotel product continues to fill rapidly too. We can have a big increase in this year of the trend of accommodations that we start growing [indiscernible] in the hotel area, but we are doing both. So that\u2019s the point. And our thing is we know, and this is really important. We know customers come to our site, come to our app. They start a one type of property. And then they switch and they look at another one, another entirely different one. And then they go back and they come back. We really believe having both types of properties, hotels and non-hotels in the same place that enables a customer to be able to compare and interest, that\u2019s what they cause or look at the reviews makes a better process for consumers over time. Now look, we just got a lot of the stuff out last year. And for example, I mentioned our requested book we\u2019re still trialing that, we\u2019re just piloting that. It\u2019s going to take some more time. I am very encouraged by where we are and where we\u2019re going. So I have no concerns about us continuing in the same direction.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Justin.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan, Goldman Sachs. Eric, please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions. Glenn, your comments around the competitive intensity that you faced in I\u2019d love to look backwards as the first part of the question and sort of reflecting back on \u201822, how you saw the competitive intensity of the industry broadly evolve against the backdrop where sort of pent-up demand was sort of a bit of a tailwind for the industry from a growth perspective. And as you look forward into \u201823 and beyond as demand somewhat normalizes away from the pent-up dynamic. How should we be thinking about some of those key initiatives you\u2019re most focused on to sort of meet where you see pockets of competitive intensity against a more normalized demand environment? Thanks so much.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. Well, the competitiveness was quite clear when you compare \u201822 versus \u201821. We had a very nice recovery in \u201821, and we benefited from the fact that a lot of our competitors just didn\u2019t seem to be out of the gate so fast in terms of their marketing, in terms of what they are doing, whether it be brand performance marketing in terms of trying to get the same demand that we are out getting there. So 2022, also we\u2019re putting a full throttle on to get those customers. So that\u2019s what we saw. We saw it in performance marketing. We saw it significantly increasing the amount of money being put into brand marketing. In lots of different ways that everybody wanted to make sure that they are out trying to get those customers. Tthat was the difference between \u201821 and \u201822. That\u2019s when I speak about what a competitive market really was last year. But look, this industry has always been competitive. The wonderful thing about the way technology has developed is that enables customers with very little friction to be able to look at all the different ways they can be very trial. So we have to always be providing them with a great service, a great price, so they will actually use us. It\u2019s one thing that I think some people will recognize as much perhaps is that this is on every day we go out there and we fight for those customers. Yes, we have loyal customers. They\u2019ll work because we\u2019ve providing them with a great service and price. We got to keep on doing it to maintain their loyalty. And we\u2019re going to keep on doing that. Now in terms of the future, in terms of areas that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get any less competitive, but I do think that we do have some advantages because of our great technology because of the skill sets that we have to continue to try and advance this service better, so people do use it and then they do say, hey, I\u2019m going to go to Booking because it\u2019s just better. And that\u2019s they going to have to keep on doing, but there is no magic bullet here. We\u2019ve got to do it every day.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thank you, Glenn.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from John Colantuoni, Jefferies. John, please go ahead.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks for taking my question. So marketing efficiency moved back to 2019 levels in the second half of \u201822 after being much higher in the first half. And I realize \u2013 some of that is just the timing of the recovery and sort of the transition to a more competitive environment that you just talked about in the prior question. But how are you thinking about balancing continued investments in customer acquisition with driving EBITDA dollars in 2023, along with the mix between sort of merchandising and marketing? So any detail there would be helpful. And then if you could give some more detail about how bookings so far in the core summer period have trended, that would be great. Thanks.\nDavid Goulden: Alright. John, let me answer both those questions. So as I think you know, we took a conscious decision, especially in 2022 to kind of lean into our marketing channels, the combination of merchandising and marketing. And collectively, they were a fair amount higher than they were in 2019 from expense point of view. And that was a conscious choice, we believe that is reflected in the share gains we\u2019ve made, not just in the U.S., but also globally. We \u2013 obviously, we have recovered the level much more than the travel industry as we talk. When you look at occupancy rates and how they have recovered and you look at our room nights, and obviously, we\u2019re significantly in front of that. So we believe that has been a sensible investment. We \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we will keep the combined investments in marketing and merchandising in 2023 at about the same level as it was in 2022. Now during the year, we will kind of look at what we think the right balance of merchandising versus marketing is. From the comments that I made, you would realize we probably on average across the year compared to 2022, spending a bit more on merchandising, a bit less on marketing, but that could change during the year. We can\u2019t really think of a tune based upon the efficiencies we see in each of the cells. And we will stay at that more elevated level because we believe the market is still recovering. There is still potential for share gains for us in our marketplace. So we don\u2019t really think of it together. And if you kind of look at it versus 2019, it\u2019s a fairly sizable step up. But we think that\u2019s been a smart investment and a good investment that makes sense at least this year, we still see recovery in the travel industry. And if you remind me again please, the second part of your question?\nJohn Colantuoni: Second part was if you could give any detail around summer bookings so far.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Thank you. So summer bookings, yes. So we have seen, as I mentioned, the travel window \u2013 the booking window recover completely on a global basis. But actually, the booking window has now expanded a little bit in Europe and North America and still slowly was \u2013 or shortly was, I would say, in Asia. So that means that in Europe and North America, we\u2019re seeing strong demand for short-term bookings but also for summer bookings. So we\u2019re seeing the summer booking season shape up quite well. We\u2019re not going to repeat on the book type metrics we talked about last year. We think they perhaps caused a better future, but more appropriate for a recovering environment, but you can see based upon the fact that we have strong growth in rents, we have now in those markets, slightly lengthened booking windows, strong growth in gross bookings, then obviously, that would certainly say subject to, obviously, the fact that things are cancelable and a high degree of our bookings are flexible, but it certainly looks like it\u2019s shaping up to be a strong summer season for us.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from Kevin Kopelman, Cowen. Kevin, please go ahead.\nKevin Kopelman: Thanks. I want to ask about the flights initiatives. Could you update us there and what the outlook is for flights this year? And then also could you comment on the traveling?\nGlenn Fogel: Sure, Kevin. So in the prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about the number of countries we have. They are obviously we\u2019re very pleased where we are in terms of the growth of the number of tickets that we\u2019re selling now is very good product. We like it because, as I mentioned, people, some people go to flights first, and we want to make sure they know who we are and then start buying from us. In terms of the acquisitions, I can\u2019t \u2013 you have the world work to regulations, I have nothing to comment on that. We continue to work with the people in the process and continue to work on that. But I would say, just so please, we look where we were \u2013 again, because I listened to that call 3 years ago, the earnings call, and we just 3 years ago, talked we just started in 2019, the flights been up off the ground, so sorry about deployments at Booking.com. And we are just starting to where we are now. I just love the \u2013 what the people have been able to build, and I love the fact that people like it and are coming to us. And we have high hopes for the future in this area.\nKevin Kopelman: Okay, Glenn. And a quick \u2013 one other quick one, as we think about year-over-year comps as the year goes on, is it fair to think it\u2019s \u2013 Q2 has a pretty tough comp and then the second half is more normal?\nGlenn Fogel: I\u2019ll let David talk about that if he wants to or not.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, if you look at year-on-year, then obviously, the comps get harder when we get past Q1, right? Q1 is going to be the easiest comp on a year-on-year basis. And the toughest quarter on a year-on-year basis will be Q2. because remember, we had that kind of early peak in travel bookings in the many time frame last year as we have \u2013 went through our non-linear recovery. We always said it would be a non-linear. So Q1 will be just comp. Q2 will be the toughest comp and Q3 and Q4 a little way between.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that was your final question. I will now turn it back to Glenn Fogel for closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. And I want to close by thanking everyone at Booking Holdings and everyone around the world who are contributing to help the people a bit so terribly hurt by the tragic events in Turkey and Syria. We have employees in Turkey and many more who have family and friends there, along with supply partners in the devastated area. Our hearts go out to all who are suffering there. Thank you, and good night.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you for those comments, Glenn. And as you said, I am not going anywhere for some time over the next year in my CFO role and when involved beyond that, I will remain as focused as ever on continuing to help deliver strong results from the business and creating value for our stakeholders. Now turning to our results. I will review our results for the fourth quarter and provide some color on the trends we have seen so far in the first quarter and our thoughts on 2023. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-on-year basis unless otherwise indicated, but we will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to the fourth quarter. We are encouraged to see room night growth of 10% in the fourth quarter, up from 8% room night growth in the third quarter, with the improvement driven by Asia and the U.S. For the fourth quarter, the U.S. was up more than 35%, rest of world was at 110%, and Europe and Asia were both up mid single-digits. Q4 was the first quarter of room night growth in Asia versus 2019. Our growth in total room nights on a year-on-year basis increased from 31% in Q3 to 39% in Q4. Our mobile apps represented over 45% of our total room nights in the fourth quarter and about 45% for the full year. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year relative to 2021 and 2019. The international mix of our total room nights in Q4 was about 48%, which was higher than Q3, but still a few percentage points below Q4 2019. Our cancellation rate was slightly above 2019 levels in Q4, but were slightly below 2019 levels for the full year. In Q4, the booking window of Booking.com remained shorter than in 2019 similar to what we saw in the third quarter of 2022. This booking window expanded meaningfully versus the fourth quarter of 2021 when we saw a higher mix of near-term bookings during the COVID-19 Omicron variant wave. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our room night growth rate was about 15% in Q4 versus 2019 and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 29%, which was a couple of percentage points higher than Q4 2019 and Q4 2021. Q4 gross bookings increased 32% versus 2019 or 47% on a constant currency basis. The 32% increase in gross bookings was 22 percentage points better than the 10% room night increase due to 29% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to 5 points from strong flight bookings across the group partially offset by 15 percentage points of negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about 1 percentage point from regional mix and about 28 percentage points from rate increase across all our regions. Despite the higher ADRs in the fourth quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or change in length of stay that could indicate that customers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up about 2.9% versus a small base in 2019 and up about 61% versus 2021 driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight products. Revenue for the fourth quarter was up 21% versus 2019 and up about 35% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points below Q4 2019 and was about in line with our expectations. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q4 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 32% versus Q4 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with our expectations and with Q4 2019. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points compared with Q4 2021 and was in line with our expectations. About 42% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q4, up from about 30% in Q4 2021. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 24% versus Q4 2021, which was higher than our expectations primarily due to changes in FX in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was over $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, which was 3% below 2019 and would have been around 16% above 2019 on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP net income of $957 million results in non-GAAP EPS of about $25 a share, which was up 6% versus Q4 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of over $1.2 billion in the quarter, which included a $240 million pre-tax gain related to the sale of our office building for Booking.com's future headquarters in a sale leaseback transaction as well as $179 million unrealized gain in our equity investments, primarily related to Meituan, JD and Grab. When looking at the full year, we are pleased to report that our 2022 room nights were 6% higher than 2019 and our gross bookings were 26% higher and about 36% higher on a constant currency basis. Our full year revenue was over $17 billion, which was 13% above 2019 and up about 24% on a constant currency basis. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.1% in 2022, which was lower than the 15.6% in 2019 due to almost a full point negative impact from timing, about 40 basis points from the slow recovery in our advertising and other revenues, which have no associated gross bookings and about 30 basis points from an increased mix in flights. The benefit of take rates in 2022 from increased revenue from payments was offset by our increased investments in merchandising, each of which impacted our reported take rates by about 1 percentage point in 2022 compared to about 0.5 percentage point each in 2019. These changes in payments revenue and merchandising costs versus 2019 are mainly at Booking.com. Our full year adjusted EBITDA was about $5.3 billion, which was 10% below 2019 and up about 6% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31%, which was 4 points higher than our EBITDA margin in 2021 and better than our expectations for a few points higher at the start of the year. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash investment balance of $15.2 billion was up versus our Q3 ending balance of $11.8 billion driven primarily by the $3.6 billion bond offering we completed in Q4, the $2.1 billion of free cash flow generated in the quarter, and about $600 million in proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction I mentioned previously. This increase in our cash balance was partially offset by about $2.3 billion in share repurchases in Q4 and by the payment of about $780 million in November debt maturity. For the full year 2022, we generated almost $6.2 billion in free cash flow, which was 38% higher than in 2019. We repurchased over $6.5 billion of our shares in the year and reducing our year end share count by 8% versus 2021 and by 22% over the last 5 years. We are proud of this accomplishment, because it reflects both our commitment to return capital to shareholders and how carefully we have managed our stock-based compensation expense and its dilutive impact. We continue to see many publicly traded companies pro forma out the very real expense associated with stock-based compensation. We strongly disagree with this approach, and therefore, every profit metric we report includes the negative impact of stock-based compensation expense. We view SBC expense as a very real cost of doing business across every stakeholder should fully count when evaluating the performance and returns of our business or any business. If anything, we view SBC dollars even more valuable than cash dollars because of our long-term expectation that dollars worth of stock to-date will be worth more in the future. It's the same expectation that serves as the rationale for pursuing our share repurchase program, a program that has meaningfully reduced our share count over time has not just served to offset dilution from SBC. Simply offsetting dilution does not represent a return on capital to shareholders, but actually represents a cash drain on our business that does not get counted in many companies' pro forma reporting of profits. In 2022, our stock-based compensation resulted in less than 0.7% of shareholder dilution. And during the last 5 years, it resulted in less than 3% of cumulative dilution. As I mentioned, during the same period, we reduced total share count by a net 22%, inclusive of the shares that were added as a result of our stock-based compensation activities. Our future practices will continue to be guided by the same two philosophical approaches that guide us decades, namely, number one, the stock-based compensation counts; and two, that our stock repurchases, first and foremost, are meant \u2013 are actively meant to return capital to shareholders in the form of share count reductions. In January, we started to sell down our investment in Meituan and completed the sale of our position in February. Total proceeds of $1.7 billion from the sale, represents a $1.2 billion or over 250% increase in the value of our regional investments. On an after-tax basis, we expect this to increase our available cash position by about $1.4 billion. Our business partnership with Meituan continues. As we think about our capital structure and allocation framework going forward, we are focused on growing returns for our shareholders whilst appropriately investing in our business and maintaining our strong investment grade credit ratings. We will target maintaining a gross leverage ratio of about 2%, which is about in line with the historic levels. On a net leverage basis, we have started to run the business with negative net leverage. However, we plan on moving gradually through addition our positive net leverage targeting about 1x net leverage over time. We believe managing our capital structure with these targets will allow us to maintain our strong investment grade credit ratings whilst also generating additional capacity for returning capital to shareholders as our EBITDA increases. Given these considerations and our current outlook for the business, we expect our annual total return on capital to shareholders to be at least equal to our free cash flow over the next few years. In 2019, we started the year with $4.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase organization that was approved in the prior year. And in the second quarter 2019, our Board of Directors approved a new $15 billion authorization. Since the start of 2019, we repurchased the full $4.5 billion under prior authorization and have repurchased $11.1 billion under the $15 billion authorization, leaving us with $3.9 billion remaining at the end of last year. We are announcing today that our Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $20 billion that we will begin utilizing after we complete the current authorization. We expect to complete the share repurchases under the cumulative $24 billion authorization within the next 4 years, assuming that travel continues to recover and grow from here. Before I turn to 2023, I'd like to remind you we will primarily compare 2023 with 2022. However, there will be some periods where a comparison to 2019 will be helpful to better understand the trends of the business. For example, comparing January 2023 versus 2019 helps avoid the distortion created by \u2013 from comparing to January \u201822, which was negatively impacted by the Omicron variant. As you recall, our January 2022 room nights were 21% below 2019, but it's quickly improved and February was in line with February 2019. So, now on to recent trends and our thoughts for the first quarter of 2023, in January, we booked over 95 million room nights, our highest monthly amount ever and about 10 million more room nights than our previous monthly record set last May. January 2023 room nights were up 60% on a year-on-year basis. This compares to Q4 2022 room night growth of 39% on a year-on-year basis. When comparing January 2023 with January 2019, room nights were up 26%, a very nice improvement from the 10% growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement in growth rates versus 2019 from Q4 January was driven primarily by Europe, rest of world and Asia. January room night growth versus 2019 was about 35% in the U.S., over 25% in Europe and rest of the world and over 20% in Asia. In January, we saw lower cancellation rates versus 2019. Additionally, we have seen the booking window fully normalized back to 2019 levels in January. And in some regions, it has expanded as we see a healthy mix of near-term bookings as well as bookings to stay late in the year. We also continue to see no change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that customers are trading down despite ADRs continuing to be higher than in 2019. The average length of stay of transaction booked in January continued to be a bit longer than it was in 2019. January likely saw some benefit from bookings that were made in the month \u2013 instead of December last year or potentially later in this year. This may indicate the room night growth could moderate from these levels going forward as some of these booking pattern differences normalize. On a year-on-year basis, January gross bookings were up 74% or up 83% on a constant currency basis. The 74% increase in gross bookings is 14 percentage points higher than 60% room night growth due to 13% higher constant currency ADRs and also due to a few points from flight booking partially offset by 9 percentage points of negative impact from FX movements. Gross bookings in January were up 55% versus 2019 or up 72% on a constant currency basis. While there continues to be uncertainty around the month-to-month trends, our comments for the first quarter made the assumption that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be over 30% year-on-year. Compared to 2019, this will be just over 20%, assuming some moderation in growth from what we have seen over the last few weeks. We expect Q4 gross bookings to grow about 4 percentage points faster than room nights on a year-on-year basis due to about 6% higher constant currency ADRs and a couple of points from continued flight bookings partially offset by about 6 points from FX. We expect Q1 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 10.3%, a 40 basis point improvement from Q1 2019 due to a less negative impact on timing, partially offset by increased investments in merchandising and a higher mix of clients. We expect Q1 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly lower in Q1 than in Q1 2022 due to increase in direct mix. Marketing and merchandising combined, as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1, will be a little higher than in Q1 2022, but for the full year, we expect them to be about in line with last year. We expect Q1 sales and other expenses as potential gross bookings to be about 30 basis points higher than in Q1 2022 due to higher gross merchant bookings mix and higher third-party core costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q1 to grow just over 20% versus Q1 2022 due to higher personnel and related expenses, indirect taxes and IT expenses. Taking all this into account, we expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be over $600 million, which will represent a more than 93% increase versus Q1 2022. As we think about the full year ahead, we're encouraged by the strong trends we're seeing in Q1 so far. However, we do expect continued volatility in our top line trends, which makes it very difficult to predict how the top line will progress during the year and how the full year will turn out. Assuming a moderation in growth from current levels and taking into account the more difficult comparisons as we move through the year, our full year commentary assumes low-teens gross booking growth versus 2022. Of course, it's early in the year, but this is our best estimate at this point in time. For the full year, we expect our 2023 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 50 basis points higher than in 2022, which will result in year-over-year revenue growth is higher than our year-over-year gross bookings growth. We expect the negative impact on timing to mostly go away in 2023, and we also expect that our payments mix will continue to add to take rates. Partly offsetting these are continued increases in the mix of flights in our business, an increase in merchandising spend versus 2022. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as the percentage of gross bookings will be about the same as in 2022. We expect our more fixed expenses in 2023 to grow about 20%, which is similar to the growth last year. We expect these more fixed expenses to grow more slowly in future years. As a result, we expect to deliver a record level of EBITDA in 2023 while continue to expand our EBITDA margins by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our Q4 results and the early trends we're seeing in 2023. We remain confident that our strategic priorities will enable us to provide better services for our travels and partners. We continue to remain focused on building a larger and faster-growing business than we have pre-COVID that delivers more and faster growing EBITDA dollars and more and faster growing earnings per share with industry-leading EBITDA margins. We will now move to Q&A. So Chris, can you please open the lines? Okay, Brian. Thank you. Let me take the first one and then hand over to Glenn for the second one. So Yes, there are a few puts and takes, obviously, as we think about the entire year. To answer your question, we expect that our room night growth will be slightly lower than the low teens gross booking growth. we will get a little bit of help from FX. We will get a little bit of help from flights. But we think that across the year, as the ADR compare gets harder and we got more recovery in Asia that impacts geo mix, we will see a little bit of pressure on constant currency ADRs for the full year. Mark, thank you. Just to add to comments. Relative to what we're seeing in January, we saw obviously a nice improvement in the Asia region compared to Q4. That is not being driven by China. That's been driven by the other markets in the Asia region. China is a small contributor to that improvement so far. Yes. Lloyd, let me take the first part of that. So I think I kind of went through a little bit of this in the commentary, but there is a lot of numbers in the commentary with all the comparisons of versus last year versus 2019, etcetera. So relative to the 50 bps of improvement this year, essentially, the timing drag on take rates last year has basically gone \u2013 almost entirely gone away. So there was about a point of timing last year that goes away. And also, we get a little bit of an increase from payments as payment mix increases. The offsetting amount to those get you to the plus 50 is that we have continuing this year at the same level of merchandise we exited last year out, broadly speaking. So you get a year-on-year impact of merchandising that's a negative and flight mix as well. So that's how you get to the cap plus 50 improvement from last year. So to your question on 2024 though, the timing impact has really gone away at this point in time compared to 2019, a lot less, of course, growth rate change, much more than expected during the year. So essentially, there are puts and takes along the lines. The same thing I talked about, payments, merchandising, flights, etcetera. But we don't expect major changes in the take rate level from where we are right now. You shouldn't be modeling big changes in to take rates because we have some things helping and we have some things that are hurting, and they are generally going to offset each of that broadly speaking at this point in time. Alright. Just let me take the EBITDA margin question first. So if we add a couple of points to where we are in \u201822 to \u201823, the drivers between that, the difference between that, the 39 points we were at in 2019, are basically a few things. One, we're leaning in more relative to marketing and merchandising that we did in 2019, that's very conscious to continue to gain share in the recovering market. We've got the mix of lower-margin business. We said that flights and payments will start to have an impact as they grow and they are making part of the difference. We've got some targeted OpEx investments in \u2013 when you look at our total OpEx expense vis-a\u0300-vis 2019, we've got DST and we've got FX. I mean, I don't know their impact \u2013 rough order of impact. That's how you kind of get to the 6 points of difference. So when you think about where we would go going forward from that, we do expect to be able to increase even the margins from this level. We're not trying to get back to COVID, pre-COVID volume levels, I just want to be super clear, but we do think there is still some growth potential from where we are right now. And the drivers of that, if you think of the things I just mentioned, are the reasons we're down below versus 2019 now. The drivers of that, that we think we can use to our advantage over time is that as our direct mix increases, we should be able to kind of lean in less in total to our margin spend. We may lean in to the same level in absolute terms on paid marketing, but paid market becomes a smaller part of the business. We do believe that over time, we can get more leverage on our fixed costs. But then we do expect to see continued pressure from the lower mix \u2013 from the higher mix of lower-margin businesses that will continue to grow. We believe that over the kind of medium term, we can still increase margins from where we are today into 2023. But again, not back to the 2019 levels. Thank you, Justin. Alright. John, let me answer both those questions. So as I think you know, we took a conscious decision, especially in 2022 to kind of lean into our marketing channels, the combination of merchandising and marketing. And collectively, they were a fair amount higher than they were in 2019 from expense point of view. And that was a conscious choice, we believe that is reflected in the share gains we've made, not just in the U.S., but also globally. We \u2013 obviously, we have recovered the level much more than the travel industry as we talk. When you look at occupancy rates and how they have recovered and you look at our room nights, and obviously, we're significantly in front of that. So we believe that has been a sensible investment. We \u2013 as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we will keep the combined investments in marketing and merchandising in 2023 at about the same level as it was in 2022. Now during the year, we will kind of look at what we think the right balance of merchandising versus marketing is. From the comments that I made, you would realize we probably on average across the year compared to 2022, spending a bit more on merchandising, a bit less on marketing, but that could change during the year. We can't really think of a tune based upon the efficiencies we see in each of the cells. And we will stay at that more elevated level because we believe the market is still recovering. There is still potential for share gains for us in our marketplace. So we don't really think of it together. And if you kind of look at it versus 2019, it's a fairly sizable step up. But we think that's been a smart investment and a good investment that makes sense at least this year, we still see recovery in the travel industry. And if you remind me again please, the second part of your question? Yes. Thank you. So summer bookings, yes. So we have seen, as I mentioned, the travel window \u2013 the booking window recover completely on a global basis. But actually, the booking window has now expanded a little bit in Europe and North America and still slowly was \u2013 or shortly was, I would say, in Asia. So that means that in Europe and North America, we're seeing strong demand for short-term bookings but also for summer bookings. So we're seeing the summer booking season shape up quite well. We're not going to repeat on the book type metrics we talked about last year. We think they perhaps caused a better future, but more appropriate for a recovering environment, but you can see based upon the fact that we have strong growth in rents, we have now in those markets, slightly lengthened booking windows, strong growth in gross bookings, then obviously, that would certainly say subject to, obviously, the fact that things are cancelable and a high degree of our bookings are flexible, but it certainly looks like it's shaping up to be a strong summer season for us. Yes, if you look at year-on-year, then obviously, the comps get harder when we get past Q1, right? Q1 is going to be the easiest comp on a year-on-year basis. And the toughest quarter on a year-on-year basis will be Q2. because remember, we had that kind of early peak in travel bookings in the many time frame last year as we have \u2013 went through our non-linear recovery. We always said it would be a non-linear. So Q1 will be just comp. Q2 will be the toughest comp and Q3 and Q4 a little way between."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' fourth quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report a strong finish to 2022 as we delivered fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4 billion and $1.2 million respectively, which were both ahead of our previous expectations. Room night growth versus 2019 of 10% in the fourth quarter improved from 8% growth in Q3. And for the first time, we saw room nights across four of our major regions above 2019 levels for the quarter, which was another important milestone for our recovery. Room night growth trends have further strengthened in 2023, with January room nights up 26% compared to 2019 or up about 60% year-over-year. We are very encouraged by the continued strength and resiliency of travel demand last year and into the new year which speaks to consumers' strong desire to travel. However, as we stated last year, month-on-month trends can be volatile and we recognize that there is uncertainty regarding the future path of the world's economy. And David will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and on the recent trends we have been seeing in 2023. Looking back at the full year of 2022, I am proud of our company's performance during what was a challenging and very competitive environment. Our customers booked an all-time high of nearly 900 million room nights on our platforms in 2022, which was an improvement of 52% versus 2021 and 6% higher than in 2019. Gross bookings of $121 billion exceeded the $100 billion mark for the first time in our history and increased 58% versus 2021 and 26% versus 2019 or 73% and 36% on a constant currency basis. These are record levels per room night and gross bookings were achieved despite travel restrictions still in place in many parts of the world at the onset of 2022. And I note that most of Asia did not begin to open until towards the end of the year and Russia's invasion of Ukraine negatively impacted our business. In terms of our P&L last year, we reached a new revenue record of slightly more than $17 billion, which was 56% higher than 2021 and 13% higher than 2019 or up about 71% and 24% on a constant currency basis, respectively. We achieved this strong top line result while improving our profitability with adjusted EBITDA of $5.3 billion, increasing 82% versus 2021 and margins expanding by 4 percentage points year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA was 10% below the 2019 levels. However, on a constant currency basis, it was actually 6% higher after accounting for the FX headwinds we faced in 2022. I believe these results demonstrate that we are making significant progress against our goal to build a larger and faster growing business that generates more earning dollars than it did prior to the pandemic. While there is more work to be done to achieve this long-term goal, I am encouraged by the progress we have seen so far. Regarding our long-term outlook for travel, we are pleased with the positioning of our business and are positive about the future. This, coupled with our strong balance sheet, led us to return $6.5 billion to shareholders during 2022 by purchasing our shares. At year end, our share count was 8% lower versus the prior year and returning capital to shareholders will remain a high priority for the company going forward. David will provide further thoughts on our approach in his remarks. In addition to our strong financial results in 2022, we made meaningful progress against the key strategic priorities that I highlighted on our earnings call 2 years ago. These are expanding payments at Booking.com, building out our connected trip capabilities, and strengthening our position in the U.S. market. Let me address the progress we have made in each of these areas. On payments, in the fourth quarter, we processed 42% of Booking.com's gross bookings on a merchant basis and are pleased with our progress in this area. As mentioned in the past, moving Booking.com's model from agent to merchant drives important benefits for both our supplier partners and our travelers. For our supplier partners, offering a payment solution adds value in several key ways, including providing access to additional traveler demand by enabling alternative payment methods, reducing cancellations, decreasing operational workloads and enabling fraud protection. For our travelers, Booking.com's platform allows many consumers to pay how they want to pay and we believe ultimately helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience. On the connected trip, on our long-term vision is to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. We have expanded our offering into travel verticals other than accommodations with a focus on flights. And in the future, we will work to link relevant travel components together to provide a more seamless and flexible booking and travel experience. We believe that as a result of this initiative and the improved consumer experience we will drive increases in customer engagement and loyalty to our platform over time. We have continued to make progress on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com, which is now available in over 50 countries. This flight offering gives us the ability to help our consumers book another important component of their travel in one place on our platform and allows us to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their travel discovery process. We continue to see that over 20% of all of our flight bookers globally are new to Booking.com. We will continue this important work to provide our customers the best possible trip experience we can offer. In the U.S., both our Priceline and Booking.com brands continue to execute well and contributed to U.S. room night growth of almost 30% and gross bookings growth of about 60% in 2022 versus 2019. On our volume and consumer spend basis, we have grown our U.S. business to be meaningfully larger than it was prior to the pandemic. And we believe that our growth rate has outpaced the recovery in the broader market for U.S. accommodations, which means we believe we gained market share. At Booking.com, we have taken steps to improve our offering in the U.S. by utilizing marketing to improve awareness of our brand, introducing and ramping up our flight target, scaling adoption of payments and working closely with our combination partners to ensure we are delivering incremental value to them. We are encouraged by our achievements in strengthening our positioning in the U.S., but there is much more work ahead as we continue to execute against this priority over the long-term. In terms of our core accommodation business, we continue to drive benefits for our traveler customers and for our supply partners. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. For example, as I mentioned earlier, payments brings an important benefit to our partners. In the area of alternative accommodations, Booking.com alternative accommodation room nights for the full year grew about 56% versus 2021 and about 11% versus 2019 and represented about 30% of Booking.com's total room nights. During the year, we made progress with our alternative accommodation offering for the full spectrum of property types by rolling out an enhanced payment solution for professionals, launching partner liability insurance, introducing a damage policy and piloting request-to-book functionality, which is an important feature for some individual partners. We have seen improvements in the time to first booking and better retention rates for new partners. At the same time, we are incorporating our alternative accommodation offering in some of our recent brand advertising to help raise awareness, customer awareness of this product. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product offering to our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the United States. We remain focused on building a better experience for our customers and increasing loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest level ever in the fourth quarter. Our goal over time is to further increase our direct mix through several initiatives, including continued efforts to enhance the benefits of our Genius loyalty program, further building out our connected trip vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app. The mobile app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. And ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. About 45% of our room nights were booked through apps for the year, which is about 13 percentage points higher than in 2019. For 2022, Booking.com's app remained the number one downloaded OTA app globally, and for the first time, moved into the number one position in the U.S. according to one of the leading third-party research firms. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. We believe providing attractive prices on accommodations, is very important as we aim to deliver value to our travelers. Our first priority, as we think about providing attractive prices is to work directly with our supply partners to source competitive rates. In addition to sourcing competitive rates directly from our partners, we have built up our ability to selectively offer discounts and incentives at Booking.com over the last few years. This ability to merchandise is another lever that we can now pull as we look to deliver value to our customers when we cannot directly access the most competitive pricing. We have been pleased with the levels of incremental return we have seen in 2022 from merchandising and we will continue to selectively utilize this tool going forward. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the progress our teams have made in delivering strong results in 2022, while executing against our key strategic priorities. These initiatives will help us deliver a better offering and experience for our customers and partners which strengthens both sides of our marketplace. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunity ahead for our company. Now, before I turn the call over to David, I want to share the news that David has let us know that he plans to retire from his role as CFO in early 2024, after which he will be involved with us for up to 2 more years to help initially with the transition and then with other projects and initiatives as needed. As you can see by this timeline, he is not going anywhere for quite some time. So now, let me turn the call over to David. David? Brian, why don't I take the second one. Obviously, a lot of hype about AI right now, about generative AI. And I guess hike is a good word when we talk about are we on the Gartner hike cycle right now. I'm not sure \u2013 I don't think we're into that froth of dissolution yet. I think we're still probably in the peak of inflated expectations, but there is no doubt this technology has seems to be accelerating all the time. And I think you may be limiting the question on those because it's not just how is AI going to impact search down the road, it's just AI in general. And we have been talking about this for some time always. I happened to be listening to our call from 3 years ago. And I talked about what we are doing \u2013 AI. I talked about our [indiscernible] center, I talked about the things we're doing, how important it was to develop our machine learning capabilities and all the things that we do and Booking Holding's using AI to improve the product, improve what we're presenting to our customers, working with our partners better using AI. So there is a tremendous amount of interest, of course, in all these areas and some of the stuff we see is very interesting. But I think it's going to take some time \u2013 but something \u2013 there is going to be major changes in your specific question about search, no doubt it's going to make it better. In terms of your question, how are we going to be positioned for these changes, I think the best thing anybody could do is look back at the past. There is been lots of technology changes since we first started our business over 20 years ago. And as those changes happened, we adapted and developed. We did great when, for example, people went from just desktop to mobile. And we were very good coming out with these new AI machine learning tools to be able to predict what would be best for our customer. I would say that our capabilities are as good as anybody else's and we will adapt and do very well with these new technologies. So I am confident in the future, and I am not scared, I'm actually encouraged by being able to use all of these new tools to provide a better service for both sides of the marketplace. Thanks, Mark. In regards to China, obviously, there is a lot of excitement about China, too, dropping the restrictions in terms of being able to travel due to COVID, getting everybody very excited about what does that mean. And not just for travel, of course, just reducing those restrictions is increasing GDP in China and what that's going to do in terms of demand for all sorts of things and what's that's going to do to inflation, and how is it going to impact the rest of the world economies. In terms of your specific question, you're correct. We were a small player in terms of the overall Chinese travel business before the pandemic. In terms of the future, yes, there is an opportunity there, and there are a lot of outbound travelers who definitely are hoping that they can go outbound and travel soon. I don't think it's going to happen nearly as quickly as I think some deals have been predicting. When you look at some of the numbers out of January in terms of the amount of outbound airlift available was a teens number, I think maybe it was 15% of what it was in 2019 in terms of the actual lift that you can get out of China. So I think it's going to take some time for that. Now in terms of how we can take advantage of the increase that is going to happen in future, we're going to use pretty much the same placement we use pretty much everywhere, albeit China is a little different because there is not Google there. But in terms of marketing, meaning people are aware of all the great products that we offer and be able to competitive pricing, all things any consumer cares about, whether you're in China, Europe, U.S. or wherever in the world, we will keep doing those things. I know it's not \u2013 China is a very competitive market. And it's going to take some time. And as we said when we talked about our priorities, you'll note that we take U.S. I don't say China, but I would like to be able to say, look, we have been able to be successful in gaining market share in the U.S. over the last few years. I think everybody can see those numbers. So \u2013 yes, we will try and do better than we did in the past in China, but I don't think anybody should start going to the bank with any expectations of significant improvements anytime in the near-term. What's your second question or was that \u2013 that was second question? Well, we want to increase our market share everywhere, of course. The reason we kept calling out the U.S., the U.S. very similar to Europe in many ways. And we had noticed how underindexed we were there. That's not quite the same case when we look around the world, albeit in right now, except in China, which we noted. We do fairly well in a lot of parts of the world, but there is nothing that we pull out separately and say, hey, here's another area where we're going to really press hard to try and do better at. We've kind of do what we've been doing throughout the world for a long time, it's gaining share everywhere. We don't go regional in terms of your question there. We are not going to be talking about in the U.S. in terms of steps that you are asking for. No, I'm not going to be specific in terms of that. I just would say how pleased I am. We've been talking about it for some time on these calls about what we're doing in the U.S. and gaining share and the reasons that we're doing, how we're doing it, and I'm just I'll just reiterating how pleased we are to be able to do that, and we're going to keep on grinding the way to continue to try and gain share. Regarding the alternative accommodation space, we are very pleased with what we're doing in growing. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the things that we did last year and I will repeat them all, but those are the things that we're doing to make sure that partners, that suppliers, they want to put their properties on to our platform. And that's the first thing. And having done that and doing that right now is that how do we get the awareness. So you noticed, for example, our Super Bowl ad, where we do include the non-hotel accommodation in that and make sure as we grow that branding throughout the year to make sure people are aware. It's really \u2013 it's not anything that is magic is making a product that people want to use and making a product that people who own properties want to put on our platform and then putting in the marketing to push it through. It has increased. It has not increased substantially over the years as our hotel product continues to fill rapidly too. We can have a big increase in this year of the trend of accommodations that we start growing [indiscernible] in the hotel area, but we are doing both. So that's the point. And our thing is we know, and this is really important. We know customers come to our site, come to our app. They start a one type of property. And then they switch and they look at another one, another entirely different one. And then they go back and they come back. We really believe having both types of properties, hotels and non-hotels in the same place that enables a customer to be able to compare and interest, that's what they cause or look at the reviews makes a better process for consumers over time. Now look, we just got a lot of the stuff out last year. And for example, I mentioned our requested book we're still trialing that, we're just piloting that. It's going to take some more time. I am very encouraged by where we are and where we're going. So I have no concerns about us continuing in the same direction. Sure. Well, the competitiveness was quite clear when you compare \u201822 versus \u201821. We had a very nice recovery in \u201821, and we benefited from the fact that a lot of our competitors just didn't seem to be out of the gate so fast in terms of their marketing, in terms of what they are doing, whether it be brand performance marketing in terms of trying to get the same demand that we are out getting there. So 2022, also we're putting a full throttle on to get those customers. So that's what we saw. We saw it in performance marketing. We saw it significantly increasing the amount of money being put into brand marketing. In lots of different ways that everybody wanted to make sure that they are out trying to get those customers. Tthat was the difference between \u201821 and \u201822. That's when I speak about what a competitive market really was last year. But look, this industry has always been competitive. The wonderful thing about the way technology has developed is that enables customers with very little friction to be able to look at all the different ways they can be very trial. So we have to always be providing them with a great service, a great price, so they will actually use us. It's one thing that I think some people will recognize as much perhaps is that this is on every day we go out there and we fight for those customers. Yes, we have loyal customers. They'll work because we've providing them with a great service and price. We got to keep on doing it to maintain their loyalty. And we're going to keep on doing that. Now in terms of the future, in terms of areas that I don't think it's going to get any less competitive, but I do think that we do have some advantages because of our great technology because of the skill sets that we have to continue to try and advance this service better, so people do use it and then they do say, hey, I'm going to go to Booking because it's just better. And that's they going to have to keep on doing, but there is no magic bullet here. We've got to do it every day. Sure, Kevin. So in the prepared remarks, we talked a little bit about the number of countries we have. They are obviously we're very pleased where we are in terms of the growth of the number of tickets that we're selling now is very good product. We like it because, as I mentioned, people, some people go to flights first, and we want to make sure they know who we are and then start buying from us. In terms of the acquisitions, I can't \u2013 you have the world work to regulations, I have nothing to comment on that. We continue to work with the people in the process and continue to work on that. But I would say, just so please, we look where we were \u2013 again, because I listened to that call 3 years ago, the earnings call, and we just 3 years ago, talked we just started in 2019, the flights been up off the ground, so sorry about deployments at Booking.com. And we are just starting to where we are now. I just love the \u2013 what the people have been able to build, and I love the fact that people like it and are coming to us. And we have high hopes for the future in this area. I'll let David talk about that if he wants to or not. Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. And I want to close by thanking everyone at Booking Holdings and everyone around the world who are contributing to help the people a bit so terribly hurt by the tragic events in Turkey and Syria. We have employees in Turkey and many more who have family and friends there, along with supply partners in the devastated area. Our hearts go out to all who are suffering there. Thank you, and good night."

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Please go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am encouraged by the strong results we are reporting today and by the record level of travel during our peak summer season. In the third quarter, our customers booked 240 million room nights, a little under 0.25 million room nights, which was 8% higher than in Q3 2019. We saw an improvement in room night growth during the third quarter from 4% growth in July to 10% growth in both August and September relative to the comparable months in 2019. We note that sadly, the war in Ukraine continues. And as you know, we suspended our operations in Russia and Belarus shortly after the work we get. If we exclude the suspended areas as well as Ukraine, our room night growth for the quarter would have been 11%. We are pleased that all of our major regions improved in August and September versus July and room nights in Asia surpassed 2019 levels for the first time in September. In the U.S., both our Priceline and Booking.com brands continue to execute well and contributed to room night growth of almost 30% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of 2019. We continue to see very strong accommodation of ADR growth, which helped drive a 27% increase in global gross bookings in the third quarter or 41% on a constant currency basis, both versus Q3 2019. Despite the strong pricing environment, we have not seen evidence of our customers trading down to lower hotel star ratings or reducing the length of their trips. We took another important step in our company's recovery from a profitability perspective with the third quarter being the first time that adjusted EBITDA surpassed pre-pandemic levels. In fact, the third quarter was our highest revenue and adjusted EBITDA quarter ever. Our Q3 revenue and adjusted EBITDA were 20% and 7% higher than Q3 2019 and grew 34% and 25% on a constant currency basis. More recently, we have seen resiliency in the level of demand from travelers with room night growth improving slightly from September levels to about 12% growth estimated for the month of October versus October 2019. Gross bookings in October are estimated to be up about 30% or just over 45% on a constant currency basis. The slight improvement in October was primarily driven by the continued recovery in Asia as well as a slight improvement in Europe. As we take an early look at demand into 2023 at Booking.com, we see strong growth in gross bookings on the books for travel that will take place in the first quarter of next year, though I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancellable. Interestingly, we have strong numbers on our books for early 2023 despite the booking window being shorter than it was at this point in 2019. David will provide further details on our results and on the recent trends we have been seeing. While there is a rising concern around the macroeconomic environment and uncertainty around the consumer spending, we believe the sustained level of demand we have seen through October helps demonstrate our consumers' strong desire to travel further. We believe our solid operating results, substantial liquidity and strong free cash flow positions us well to navigate potential near-term economic uncertainty while we continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform and making progress on our key strategic priorities of payments and the connected tradition. Given our confidence in the positioning of our business, the positive long-term outlook for travel and our strong balance sheet, we have stepped up the pace of our share repurchases since we reinitiated the program at the start of the year. With a $4.2 billion in repurchases for the first 3 quarters of this year, we have reduced our share count by 5% relative to our ending share count last year. We remain focused on building a better experience for our customers and addressing their needs of value, choice and convenience. With continued focus on our customers, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. We are encouraged to see our unique active customers at Booking.com above 2019 levels in the third quarter, which was driven by strong growth in reactivated customers who had not made a booking it over a year as well as growth in repeat customers. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest third quarter level ever. Our goal over time is to further increase our direct mix through several initiatives, including continued efforts to enhance the benefits of our genius loyalty program, further building out our connected vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app. The mobile app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. About 45% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the third quarter, which is just over 10 percentage points higher than in 2019. Booking.com app remains the number one downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm, and we have seen increasing levels of downloads in the U.S. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. We're thinking about addressing our customers' need for value, we believe providing attractive prices on accommodations is very important. As has always been the case, our first priority, as we think about providing attractive prices, is to source competitive rates from our supply partners. We do this by working closely with our supply partners to get the best prices possible and increase participation in our targeted rate programs to ensure that compelling prices are available to our customers. Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com is a great example of a program where hundreds of thousands of our property partners are participating to offer lower rates and other benefits to travelers in ways that meet our property partners specific revenue needs. In addition to sourcing dependent rates directly from our partners, we have built up our ability to selectively offer discounts and incentives at Booking.com over the last few years. Visibility to merchandise is another lever that we can now pull as we look to deliver value to our customers to more competitive pricing. We believe this competitive tool helps us attract and retain customers and drive improved conversion on our platform. Importantly, we take a disciplined approach to merchandising by very closely monitoring the incremental return on investment on that spend, and we can adjust the level of our spend according to our desired return objectives. We have been pleased with the levels of incremental return we have seen this year for merchandising and we'll continue to selectively utilize this tool going forward. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. Alternative accommodations of room night Booking.com grew about 11% versus 2019 and represented about 30% of Booking.com's total room nights in Q3. We have continued to make progress with our alternative accommodation offering by increasing our supply base of properties, which has grown by about 300,000 since the end of 2021 and has increased in each of our major regions around the world over that time period. We aim to build on this growth in our alternative accommodation supply base by improving our product offering to our supply partners globally with a continued focus on the U.S. market. Let me now talk about the progress we have made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. On payments, 40% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the third quarter, which, once again, is our highest quarterly level ever. We believe Booking.com payment services drive benefits for both our travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, we believe that Booking.com's payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger connected tradition. One the connected trip, our long-term vision is to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our customers and supplier partners. We are expanding our offering into travel verticals other than the combinations, and then we'll work to link relevant travel components together to provide a more seamless, flexible consumer experience. As a result of this initiative, we believe, over time, we will drive increases in customer engagement, share of spend and loyalty to our platform. We continue to make progress on building foundations that we connect provision, including our work to integrate ground transportation options and further develop our flight offering on Booking.com. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process. And over 20% of all of our flight bookings globally are new to Booking.com. There is much more work to do as we strive to give our customers the best possible trip experience, but we are pleased with the early results we have seen so far. In closure, I'm encouraged by our strong third quarter results and the sustained levels of travel demand we are seeing into the fall and into early next year. We continue to make progress in several key areas, including engagement with our app, the Genius program, our alternative accommodation offerings, payments at Booking.com and building towards our connected tradition. I believe these initiatives will help us deliver a better offering and experience for our customers and our partners. While there continues to be uncertainty around the near-term macroeconomic environment, we are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the third quarter and provide some color on the trends we've seen supply in the fourth quarter. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we were encouraged to see room night growth improved to 10% in both August and September, up from the 4% room night growth we previously reported for the month of July. All regions improved in August and September relative to July. For the full third quarter, global room night growth was 8%, with Europe up high single digits, the U.S. up almost 30% and Rest of World up over 10% and Asia down mid-single digits. And September was the first month of room night growth in Asia versus 2019 as the delayed recovery continues in that region. Our mobile apps represented about 45% of our Q3 total room nights, an increase of slightly over 40% in the second quarter. Total mobile bookings represented over 60% of our total room nights in the third quarter, also an increase from the second quarter. In the third quarter, we continue to see increasing mix of our total room nights turning to us to our direct channel versus 2019 and also versus Q3 2019 and also versus Q3 2021. The international mix of our total room nights in Q3 was about 45%, in line with Q2. Our Q3 cancellation rates continue to be below 2019 levels as they were in Q2. In Q3, the booking window of Booking.com remain shorter than in 2019, similar to what we saw in the second quarter of 2022. This booking window expanding meaningfully versus the third quarter of 2021, where we saw a higher mix of near-end bookings due to the COVID-19 Delta variant wave. For our alternative accommodation in a Booking.com, our room night growth rate was 11% in Q3 versus 2019 and the goal mix of alternative accommodations was about 30%, which is slightly higher than Q3 2019. Q3 global mix was about in line with 2021. Q3 gross bookings increased 27% versus 2019 or 41% on a constant currency basis. The 27% increase in gross bookings was 19 percentage points better than the 8% room night increase due to 28% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to 4 points from strong flight growth bookings across the group, partially offset by the 14% points of negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefit by about 2 percentage points from regional mix and about 26 percentage points from rate increases across all of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America. Despite the high ADRs in the third quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of wholesale star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trending down. We'll continue to watch closely. Airline tickets booked in the third quarter were up about 235% versus a smaller base in 2019 and up 45% versus 2021, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the third quarter was over $6 billion, which was up 20% versus 2019 and up about 34% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 110 basis points below Q3 2019 due to a number of factors, including investments in merchandising, which are consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunity for us to lead into a recovering travel market in 2022 and also due to an increase in the mix of flights, the slower recovery of our advertising and other revenues, which have no associated gross bookings and some negative impact from FX rates. Q3 take rates were down more than our expectation of being down about 70 basis points, primarily due to timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition, driven by the improved bookings in Q3, some of which relate to travel in future quarters. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q3 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, increased 27% versus Q3 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with Q3 2019, which was better than our expectations, mainly due to higher-than-expected direct mix. As expected, our marketing ROIs were lower than in Q3 2019, which was in line with our strategy to lead into a recurring travel market in the Q3 peak season. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points compared to Q3 2021, which was in line with our expectations. About 40% of Booking.com's gross bookings are processed through our payments platform in Q3, up from almost 1/3 in Q3 2021. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were better than our expectations of 17% versus Q3 2021, primarily due to a slower-than-expected ramp into our IT expenses and lower-than-expected personnel expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.7 billion in the third quarter, which is better than our expectations and about 7% above 2019 and would have been about 25% above 2019 on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP net income of $2.1 billion results in non-GAAP earnings per share of about $53 per share, which was up 17% versus Q3 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $2.6 billion in Q3. We recorded GAAP net income of $1.7 million in the quarter, which includes a $336 million unrealized loss on our equity investments, primarily related to Meituan as well as $125 million expense related to an ongoing French tax matter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash investment balance of $11.8 million was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $14.2 billion, primarily driven by about $2 billion in share repurchases in Q3 as well as the unrealized losses on our equity investments. The $2 billion in share purchases in Q3 was a step-up from the $1.3 billion in Q2 as we increased the pace of our repurchases given the pullback in our share price. In October, we repurchased another $595 million worth of our shares, which brings our year-to-date repurchase up to about $4.8 billion and our remaining outstanding authorization to about $5.6 billion. As Glenn mentioned, we reduced our share count by 5% since the end of last year. And over the last 5 years, we reduced our share count by 20% despite suspending our share buyback activity for 21 months during COVID-19 pandemic. With negative $95 million in free cash flow for the third quarter, our earnings for the quarter were offset by about a $2 billion decrease in our deferred merchant booking balance following the peak travel season in Europe and North America. Now on to recent trends on our fourth quarter. We estimate that October room night increased about 12% versus 2019, a slight improvement from the 10% growth in September, driven primarily by the continued recovery in Asia as well as a slight improvement in Europe. In October, all regions were above 2019 levels. The U.S. was of almost 35%, Rest of World was up high teens, and both Asia and Europe were up high single digits. ADR growth has remained around Q3 levels, and we estimate gross bookings were up about 30% in October, which includes negative impacts from FX pressures. We estimate that constant currency gross bookings were up just over 45% in October. While there continues to be uncertainty in the near term, our comments for the quarter make the assumption that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be about 10% above 2019, which is in line with levels of growth we've seen over the last 3 months. Compared with room night growth in Q4 versus 2019 would also be an acceleration on a year-on-year basis from 31% growth in Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021 to 39% growth in Q4 '22 versus Q4 '21. We expect the strength in ADRs we've seen in recent months to generally continue for the remainder of the fourth quarter as well as continued growth in by bookings. We expect about a 15% difference between the level of room night growth and gross booking growth, less than 19% gap in Q3 due to more FX pressure in Q4. We expect FX to pressure gross bookings growth versus 2019 by about 18% in Q4. We expect Q4 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 120 basis points lower than Q4 2019 due to investments in merchandising, an increase in mix of clients and negative impact from timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. We expect Q4 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be a bit higher than in Q4 2019 as we expect to continue to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness due to continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than Q4 2021 due to higher merchant gross bookings mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 20% higher than in Q4 2021, with personnel, G&A and IT each up similar percentage year-on-year. Taking all into account, we expect the Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be over $1.1 billion. If it were not for the impact of FX, we expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be above Q4 2019. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EBITDA margin commentary and still expect EBITDA margin for 2022 to be a few points higher than in 2021. And if not for the impact of timing, our expectations for the full year adjusted EBITDA margins would be higher by another few points. For the full year, we expect our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be just over 14%, lower than our prior expectations for mid-14% range, due primarily to timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition, driven by stronger bookings than previously expected, some of which are related to travel expected to occur in 2023. Compared to the 15.6% take rate in 2019, the expected take rate in 2022 includes almost a full point of noted impact from timing, about 40 basis points from a slower recovery in advertising and other revenue, which have no associated gross bookings and about 30 basis points from increased mix of flights. The benefit to take rates in 2022 from increased revenues associated with payments is offset by our increased investments in merchandising, each of which impacts our reported take rates by about 1% in 2022 compared with about 0.5% each in 2019. These changes in payment revenues and merchant costs versus 2019 are mainly on Booking.com. Looking forward into window months, the booking window continues to be shorter than it was in 2019, which means that we would expect lower levels of future stays already on our books. Given this, we are pleased that the gross bookings we've already received at Booking.com for in Q1, up about 25% in euros versus the same time in 2019. Of course, we note that high percentage of these bookings are cancellable. While this represents a relatively small percentage of the total revenue we record in Q1, we think it's a helpful early data points to share. In closing, we're pleased with our Q3 results and the trends that we're seeing into Q4 and early into 2023. We remain confident that our strategic priority is the right ones and will enable us to provide better travel services for our customers and partners. We'll now move to Q&A. And Sylvie, can you please open the lines?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Lloyd Walmsley at UBS. Please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: All right. Two, if I can. First, it sounds like you're not seeing any consumer weakness right now, but are there any actions you're thinking about taking or approaches to the cost to batten down the hatches ahead of what could be a tough year from a macro standpoint? And maybe help us think about fixed cost growth and marketing posture for next year? And then second one would just be, can you give us an update on payments monetization and profitability? I appreciate some of the added disclosure you gave us this quarter. But maybe where are we in the rollout of FX translation? And how should we think about impact of that on take rates and profitability maybe over the next year or so?\nGlenn Fogel: Lloyd, why don't I take the first one. I'll let David talk about payments, then add anything he wants in terms of fixed cost going forward. So obviously, we are very pleased with third quarter and we are very pleased with what we're seeing, albeit it's small numbers into the first quarter. David just talked about that 25% on the books in Europe in euros, I'd like to see that. Your question is, is there anything we're seeing from consumer sentiment or on expanding some macro that may be inhibiting growth or be hurt in the future? And something that's very hard to know is what's the counter factual. And we're doing well measure would be if all these terrible things that we read in the newspapers have not been happening, how much better would it be? I can't measure that? I don't know. What I do know, though, is that we are seeing good numbers, and we're pleased with where we are. We know that we've been through bad times in the past and were able to do very well. We've made adjustments where we've had to. I've been now in this company for 23 years almost. We've had some recessions and we have some real disasters. And we have managed this company extremely well steering it through some very stormy weather and being able to adjust. So many of our expenses are variable, so we can adjust very quickly and we adjust automatically almost as volumes change. But I'm feeling good right now, albeit the world can change any time, and I'll let David now talk to you want to say about specifically fixed expenses and also about payments.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Thank you, Glenn. I just point that about two-thirds of our expenses are variable, which is caused a very important starting point. We, of course, do look at the fixed payments costs very carefully, but just put that into context. And then also just to clarify, the 25% is actually a Booking.com global number, not just Europe, it's around the whole business. So I think Glenn said what we need to say about the expense side. We will -- we have an agenda to move forward, we really want to continue enhancing our products and services and obviously, that requires continued investments and movement towards further important payments that the connected trip. Relative to the payment platform, of course, we are pleased with the progress. We did give you some additional delay, as you mentioned. So you get a feel for what the revenues are for payments now, also you get a feel of what the corresponding expenses are in sales and others that offset those revenues. Because as we said, this year, we're running the payments platform at about breakeven when you look at revenues and you subtract the sales and other expenses. What I'll also tell you is that relative to 2019, payments is having about 0.5 basis points or about 0.5 point impact on our EBITDA margins as that mix of revenue has increased our breakeven or at mix revenue has increased. Now of course, back in 2019, we actually weren't a breakeven, but the combined impact of where we were to where we are now is about 0.5 point of headwind on our margin, but of course, is giving us additional capabilities. Going forward, room night has not changed. So we do expect to turn to profitability in that combination of payments platform, a combination of revenues, less sales and expenses in 2023. We are rolling out FX and other services on a market-by-market basis. And of course, testing levels we always do before we continue to push them further. We have an exciting road map. It's a multiyear road map for payments. I don't expect anything to change very rapidly in the course of 12 months, it will be a course of multiple years. But if you look at the sources we can provide for our business today in terms of reducing friction for customers and bookers and then we can look at how payments can really help underpin the factor in the future, we're very encouraged and excited about it. I think with the additional disclosure we give you today will be help have a more constructive dialogue upon how it's doing going forward against those benchmarks.\nOperator: Next question will be from Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. I appreciate the color on the U.S. almost growing 30%. I guess -- the question on the U.S. as you're sort of looking at the different regions of the globe from a profitability perspective, can you just help us understand where you are at this point from the U.S. from a profit contribution perspective? Or is it still sort of very much in investment mode to drive growth? And how do you think about the path to making that a more -- a more profitable region for the company? And the second one, I'm going to mispronounce it. It's a Majorelle and Majorelle, I apologize. David, can you just talk us again about how do we think about the puts and takes or potential tailwinds of that arrangement into 2023 to the P&L?\nDavid Goulden: Okay. Brian, we can take in reverse order. So Majorelle, you're very close, is basically, from a P&L point of view, this year is just moving around geography because always going through a transition phase, I think we mentioned that about $25 million of personnel expense quarter and about $6 million of G&A expense a quarter move out of those lines respectively and into sales and other. And that started in June 1. Essentially, starting in Q3 and Q4, you see the full impact of that. As we mentioned, the policy Majorelle does have some cost benefits to it, but really most about flexibility. It's about our ability to flexible down quickly, respond to different market needs, different pictures of languages. So over the longer term, compared to continuing to build out ourselves, there are some cost benefits and it'll start occurring in 2023. We haven't quantified yet. We'll think about whether it makes sense to try and quantify the middleware for you next year. But again, it's not the primary driver. So I'm not saying there are no cost managers. That's not why we entered into that partnership. What we sell says the partnership is working exceptionally well. We just completed the summer period, and our customer service results were also solid under the new regime because we did keep some folks ourselves. On the U.S., well, of course, we are growing. So we're investing. I mean it's no big surprise. We haven't broken out contribution margin dollars in different regions. We don't plan to do that. But obviously, we're investing in the U.S. to grow a position, which is continued to increase. And as that increases over time, we'll be able to deliver higher profitability for it. But we're not -- we're not any way this leaves with what we're doing in the U.S. And obviously, it's a market where people do make money, and we do too, just maybe not the same rate as the market we're not investing in price heavily.\nOperator: Next question will be from Kevin Kopelman at Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kopelman: Just a follow-up on the marketing spend. Could you characterize how you see the competitive environment right now on advertising channels over Q3 and quarter-to-date? How that compared to earlier in the year and maybe also compared to 2019?\nGlenn Fogel: One, I just mentioned in general and then if David want to state specific. Look, marketing for travel is always extraordinarily competitive. It's never not competitive. No matter what channel you're spending your money, it's competitive. And we're always trying to make the right judgment and how much money to spend, what we think the ROI is going to be and looking into it for the long view in terms of what this does in terms of our overall building the franchise. I can't give any specifics in terms of up and down. David can talk about percentages of the amount of marketing spend we've been doing versus gross bookings over the last couple of years. But again, the market is never less competitive. It's always competitive, and I think we have performed very, very well regardless.\nGlenn Fogel: Go ahead, Kevin, please. Do you have the second question?\nKevin Kopelman: Just a kind of a separate follow-up on investment levels. Can you talk about just how headcount has been trending? Kind of what you're doing now in terms of hiring? And any color on how that looks over the next year?\nDavid Goulden: Sure. Just to finish up on Glenn's point on the market environment. Remember that we did say that our ROIs were a little lower this last point in Q3, as we expected. We targeted lower ROIs obviously that we chose to drive ourselves to continue to lean into the recovery. Also remember, our ROIs were actually, in fact, higher in the first half than they were in 2019. So you have a little bit in that context. Investment levels, we continue to be -- I'd say, we continue to want to invest in the business. But of course, we do recognize some of the backlog factor. We're not going to pull back anything strategic from what we want to do if we have a short-term slowdown. But of course, we are looking at how many people we add and where we are to make sure we are them against the things that really matter most for the business, as you would expect us to do.\nOperator: Next question will be from Mark Mahaney at Evercore. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney : Two questions, please. Can you talk about how you have been able to drive up that mobile app usage? There's obviously got great benefits for the business model. But how have you been able to do it? And just -- I know you'd like to get it higher. How much higher? What's realistic for how much higher it could get? And then if you could, please double-click on the flights business? And where are you now in terms of rolling that out and to how many markets, how broadly used is it or how high is the awareness of the product? Just talk about what the growth path is just for those flights product.\nGlenn Fogel: Mark, so you're very right about the importance of the mobile app, and I say that every single prepared remarks call we do, I always mentioned it's an important part of our platform. How we are doing is by creating a great experience for the people who are using it. That's the same thing we all think you're trying to get somebody uses provide a great experience will come back and they'll tell all the people, et cetera. We're not necessarily doing anything really different than anything anyone else does, but just doing it well. In terms of when do -- what would be the top level for it? That's hard to say because as the people who create these mobile devices continue to prove upon it and people find it more advantageous to use that versus their desktops, it's hard to say, but it could be an extremely high number that people go to the mobile device. Now our job is to make sure people use our app use mobile web search where we have to pay, which is one of the key things. We mentioned, I think, over 60% of our business was going in mobile, but 45% is at the app. So obviously, we want to make anybody using the mobile device. We want them to use the app is how to direct them. Regarding flights, I should have checked countries. I haven't done that recently. It's an awful lot, but some of the areas is a relatively low amount because there's very little awareness. I think, for example, I give you an extreme. I know we brought up Pakistan, not that long ago, not a lot of flights yet in Pakistan, but we are getting out there. The key thing for us again is creating a better experience. And I'll be honest with you. Our flight product is not yet, what I would say, as good as it should be. We continue to improve upon it, make it better than it's been in the past, providing the features that some other of our competitors offer up to consumers that we don't do yet that we want to offer. So there's a lot of upside left in this, I think a tremendous amount of upside. And the numbers are still, while we like the growth rates, it's still relatively small.\nOperator: Next question will be from Justin Post at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. One for Glenn. Obviously, merchandising, I think you all at a one point headwind, payments might be offsetting. But can you explain why you think that's a good thing to do? Is it training the consumer? Is this something you have to comp next year? Why do you like that aspect of the business? And then maybe for David, assuming we don't have a real unusual year for travel. As you think about the unwind of the timing differences and the added marketing spend this year, how do we think about those kind of unwinding next year? And then maybe last, if you want to call anything about 1Q. I remember, I think we had a real COVID slow start to the quarter and then bookings really accelerated in March. If there's anything unusual in Q1 we should be thinking about.\nGlenn Fogel: So I'll talk a little bit about merchandising. A couple of things. First thing is, so can be an investment that we're making, a way to bring in customers, retain customers or ways that we feel it necessary to be competitive against other OTAs or our suppliers even. The fact is that we're always looking where to spend the money at the best return. And merchandising, if we see somebody else is off in a lower price, we recognize that one of the most important things is to give a competitive price, and we need to make sure that we're offering that up to the customer. Many times, we want to do my talk with our supplier partners and making sure they bring us as I said in the prepared remarks about bringing us the most competitive prices. But if for some reason is not available, and we feel a need, we'll put money in there to make sure that our customers like to at Booking.com and we'll provide them with a great place to do their travel bookings. That's one. Second thing is I want to make sure everybody understands that merchandising doesn't always mean a discount by us. It can mean lots of things. People offering up some other type of benefit, for example. Although it if somebody were to offer up a upgrade in a room, I'll consider that a merchandising technique to do. If somebody offers a free breakfast at the hotel, I'll consider that too. We're not paying for that breakfast, it's the free breakfast. So parts of ways to do lots of levers to play. That's one of the things we think is so important is making sure that we are providing the most competitive offering out in the space and in addition, being able to use all of our investments in the right way at the right time to get the right return. And as a lot of data to see where is it best to be put out. I'll let David go with the other two questions.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Thanks, Glenn. Yes, in terms of -- just as looking forward, on the timing side, I mentioned the timing is costing us about 1 point of take rate this year. We think we have most of that back next year, maybe not 100% of it. There probably be some timing impact. But again, it's really a function of what the growth rates look like going into and going out of the year, but assume we get most of that back. On the marketing and merchandising side combined, that's where we've been leading in this year to really take advantage of a recovering marketplace. We certainly will be deleveraging on those lines further next year. But we want to see really what the market looks like in terms of how much recovery there is left to get it sort of recovering interact travel recovery. There are a few things that have not yet gone back to where they were before. So we'll look at exactly what the right level of investment is. And if we feel that we continue to gain share, we believe we're gaining this year, we believe we gained share last year. We share gains in outlets we have that we may maintain those levels for a while until we get back to a more normal market growth rate. And we'll give you more thinking on where we are on that spectrum when we get together in February we completed our planning process for the year, and we've got a bit more visibility into next year. And then finally, on your Q1 question, yes, Q1 last year was unusual. Omicron was really having an impact. We'll have to see exactly what happens the different variants that are out there this year. We wanted to give you that stats about 25% more gross bookings on the books. For next year, we had the same half of '19 for the first quarter of 2020 as a way to understand the book is building quite nicely for Q1. Obviously, there's a lot of ground to happen between now and their store represents a relatively small percentage of what we'll do in total in Q1 for revenue, but we think it's a -- it's a positive stat. And if a stat we gave out a couple -- actually for the last two quarters and the number was more like 15% forward growth, not 25% and in both cases, the revenue for the quarter wound up being a fair amount higher than our early indicator as those books built. Now again, don't forget -- I'm talking about the euro number, just to be clear, was 25%.\nOperator: Next question would be from Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: I have two. I know you indicated you're not seeing hotel trade down or shortening of trips. I just wanted to clarify, is that the case across all geographies? And do you have any more relative stability in the U.S. versus other regions? And then secondly, how should we think about ADR growth? I know you said it continues to be strong. But as you look into '23, just factors around FX and any relevant mix factors and like-for-like potential pressures as well?\nGlenn Fogel: So Doug, I'll start with the hotel trading down stars or I have not seen anything in any sort of geographical area that would anything stand out differently. We're seeing people who want to travel to have a significant amount of savings over this COVID period and they want to travel and some are even traveling longer to stay and enjoying it regardless of what the economic situation is. So we -- I have not seen anything and David, you saw I would say anything that where you talk about what we're seeing for ADRs going forward, I'm not sure we've said we were going to say publicly.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. On the mix -- on the trade down, Doug, as you mentioned, we're not seeing that in Europe to be perfectly clear because that's where sometimes people are asking the question, but we're not seeing global either. So it's just not factor, but particularly, it's also not a factor in Europe either. On the ADRs that we got some takes into next year, we'll talk in constant currency because it's difficult to know exactly how exchange rates are going to move on us. We're not really -- so the 28 points of constant currency ADR mix we saw in Q3, and we saw continued roughly same level into October was 26 points from rates and only 2 percentage points from mix. So as ADR continues to rebound, we'll lose that 2-point of mix, which is really what's driving right now, the fact that Asia had a lot of mix down it used to be. So that will go away. But obviously, most of what we're seeing is rate driven. And as we talk to our property partners, they continue to be facing the same expense pressure and inflation pressures that made people face you in terms of utility, energy, labor, et cetera. So we'll see how the environment develops and we have no other color on that to give at this point in time. We'll update you again when we get to February, if we see anything differently.\nOperator: Next question will be from Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe a few, if I can, on the alternative accommodation space where you made some interesting comments there. When you think about supply growth, are there any areas of either geographic focus or mix or types of properties or types of duration stays that are levels of target for supply growth as you look out into '23 and beyond in terms of alternative accommodations? Is there any color also you can give us on, as you have more of that type of supply to show that the consumer what that might do to either a traffic conversion or ROI in the platform as you have a wider array of inventory to show the consumer? And the last piece for you, is there any element of either mix or size of the business you're sort of thinking about in terms of striking the right balance between traditional inventory and alternative accommodation inventory over the long term?\nGlenn Fogel: So Eric, basic concept for us has always been more is better, more supply is better and it's always the consumer's choice of what they want to stay, where they want to stay. They want to stay in a home or villa, apartment or a hotel, that's it. So in terms of overall, we do need to continue working hard at getting more supply of all types. I've talked many times in the past about our need for the single property, the home specifically that we need to build. I talk geography. I've always talked about we need to build in the U.S. even better. And one of the things is creating a better onboarding experience for people who own these properties, improving the payments for these people, coming up with ways they feel better about having some may stay in their property with an insurance type property. These are something that we have been working on that we brought out, and we're going to continue to roll things out down the road to make it better for the owners and the managers of these properties to be willing to put it up on our platform. Now I believe the -- and this is what we've seen over many, many years is that as we bring more and more supply in, that will help us build the business. And I absolutely think that this is something that is not some is going to require some rocket science or some great thing that can't be invented. People are doing this. We just need to continue to work on it, put people to work, create the things necessary, and we will roll this out on the is taking longer than I would like, but I am very pleased with where we are. And I think some of the numbers that we've talked about are encouraging.\nOperator: Next question will be from Naved Kahn at Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Glenn, I think you mentioned you see opportunities to enhance the experience in the mobile app. Can you give an example of what kind of things we could see there? And then I don't know if you guys updated us on the mix of urban and cross-border any stats that would be pretty helpful.\nGlenn Fogel: I'll let Dave talk about stat you want to revolve about urban or. But in term of the app, I'll give you one right off the bat that I think is a -- and again, I look at it as a traveller, I say, what am I missing? Why am I not getting this? Something is simple as, as you know, we have attraction, so we're building that up right now. But in destination, I need to have things being popping up on my screen from our app, telling me great things to do, maybe the discount or skip a line, things that will make somebody say, \"Gee, using Booking.com for this travel experience is much better because I'm getting so much more.\" And I can go through so many different examples of that. The great thing about the mobile app is in people's hands or in their pocket book or in their pocket, they're carrying it with them. And that gives us the connection to be able to provide better service, better things to do, better value. And that's why it's such an important part of this connected trip vision. David, I don't know if you want to give anything from any steps?\nDavid Goulden: No sense on the note to say that historically, is we've had a heavier weight of mix urban not. So as recovery continues, if people go back to cities and other locations that usually is a positive for us, but no stats on mix. On cross-border, we did tell you that we're back up to 45% of our bookings now in the third quarter. For international, that's down from a little over 50% on a pre-pandemic basis. So there's still some decent recovery left there to we had as things continue to normalize back to where they were.\nOperator: Next question will be from Lee Horowitz at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLee Horowitz: Two on margins that -- margin, if I could. When you think about margins beyond this year, how does the strength in direct and applicants impact the way you think about the long-term margin profile of the business, particularly with some of your growth initiatives like flights having lower margin than your core could direct end of offsetting these headwinds in the fullness of time? And then when you think about the shape of margins perhaps next year, how it all should we be thinking about APAC being potentially a source of premium growth impact in the overall margin profile of the business in 2023?\nDavid Goulden: Yes, Lee, I really try to talk about 2023 margins today. That's really a conversation for next February, but maybe longer term, is a place to have to kind of recap on what we're thinking and save the 2023 commentary for them. So as we said, the -- our strategy here is to build a better product and service for customers and partners. So they'll come back to us more frequently and more directly. And obviously, our direct mix is super important and direct mix is tied heavily to frequency and to people who do more with. People who bought a buy multiple things from us are much more likely to come back to us directly in the through the pay channel. So yes, of course, there are some headwinds to our volume profile because of our business mix changing and is changing from almost the pure accommodation business, having a higher mix of payments, a high mix of flights and those are of course lower margin businesses, we've had that conversation before. But most important thing we can do to kind of keep our margins in a strong position is to continue to drive that mix of direct up, and that will impact all parts of the business. But as we said before, we'll be industry-leading profitability and margins. Because of the mix factors, we do not have a -- we believe that medium term, the margin will be a little bit lower than they were in 2019, but we'll have a faster growing business with more EBITDA, more earnings per share that's growing faster than the top line and bottom line, we think that's the most important thing.\nOperator: Next question will be from Mario Lu at Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMario Lu: The first one is on the room night guide in the fourth quarter, the 10% for 2019. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about what you saw in October? Did the trends within the month get worse as we exited the month? Just trying to tie that 10% versus 12% in October? .\nDavid Goulden: So yes, sure. The 10% room night guide, it's -- it's really a framework what we give you for Q4. There's still a lot of volatility. And obviously, we can't predict exactly what's going to happen to room nights in November and December, given the back were out there. But what we did was say, look, we grew -- we've been growing at 10% increase up to 12%. It's a nice round number to kind of pin our commentary to with Q4 to explain to you what the shape of the P&L might be. It does not indicate that there was a slowdown at the end of October. In fact, room night growth was fairly linear at 12% throughout the entire month of October. So it's more of a framework than it is a hard guy. But of course, we give you a number to kind of think about when building your models, but it's not reflective of anything we're seeing in October, either slowing down or speeding up. It's just a way to think about the shape of the income statement and how things might look in Q4.\nMario Lu: And then just one on alternative combinations. You guys mentioned as a percentage of total, it's around 30%, slightly higher than 3Q '19. I guess, are there any low-hanging fruit or opportunities ahead to kind of increase this percentage over the next couple of years?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, I mean, we could easily increase that if we didn't do so well in hotels. It's one of those things where we think of this holistically, we want to get more bookings, as I mentioned earlier. This is really a case where the consumer makes the decision, not us. We think one of the great advantages of our platform is that we offer all the different types of accommodations. And we have seen the data where people come to our site. And the first thing they're looking at may be one type of combination, let's say, hotel. They end up booking with a home because they saw that in the search results and they were going back and forth looking around. It's really so that we're very pleased to have that ability to offer up all the types of accommodations to the customer. So I don't see anything to try and artificially try and drive more people to the alternative accommodations necessarily a thing that's going to increase the value of the company. I think providing the customer with what they want, what they need, what they think is best for them is really the right way being consumer-centric and really driving that is the best way to build the company.\nOperator: Your last question will be from Stephen Ju at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nStephen Ju: So Glenn, your unit growth commentary in the U.S. was actually very interesting. So can you talk about the relative size of your user base for Booking.com in the U.S. versus, say, Priceline? And presumably booking continues to grow, do you think it's necessary to support both brands longer term. And if you were to take one step out and zoom out more globally, there was always a sharper line in the sand between the consumer experience on booking and? Or do you think as you do more merchandising and connected trips, should we be thinking about a unified brand position under Booking.com?\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So let me talk in general about why we have different brands. We have different brands because they offer a different user experience to the consumer and the different things that they are aiming to do different strategies. We really -- we totally understand the issue of are we calling excess cost? Are there ways to save money by doing things that are not duplicative? So we are -- we understand that. We are working all the time looking at those things that we can try and improve upon. But at this time, I do not see any reason I'd want to separate out and say, well, we're going to at one of these and just go under one brand. Some of our competitors have done that. And to me, that may be there -- our strategy is to continue with the differentiation among these brands and continue to build them out the way they're doing them. In terms of the actual North U.S. for Priceline versus booking, I don't believe we never disclose anything of that nature. So I think we're going to sit tight with that and keep going the way we are.\nOperator: At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fogel. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. And I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for the company. Thank you, everyone, and good night.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending. And at this time, we do ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the third quarter and provide some color on the trends we've seen supply in the fourth quarter. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we were encouraged to see room night growth improved to 10% in both August and September, up from the 4% room night growth we previously reported for the month of July. All regions improved in August and September relative to July. For the full third quarter, global room night growth was 8%, with Europe up high single digits, the U.S. up almost 30% and Rest of World up over 10% and Asia down mid-single digits. And September was the first month of room night growth in Asia versus 2019 as the delayed recovery continues in that region. Our mobile apps represented about 45% of our Q3 total room nights, an increase of slightly over 40% in the second quarter. Total mobile bookings represented over 60% of our total room nights in the third quarter, also an increase from the second quarter. In the third quarter, we continue to see increasing mix of our total room nights turning to us to our direct channel versus 2019 and also versus Q3 2019 and also versus Q3 2021. The international mix of our total room nights in Q3 was about 45%, in line with Q2. Our Q3 cancellation rates continue to be below 2019 levels as they were in Q2. In Q3, the booking window of Booking.com remain shorter than in 2019, similar to what we saw in the second quarter of 2022. This booking window expanding meaningfully versus the third quarter of 2021, where we saw a higher mix of near-end bookings due to the COVID-19 Delta variant wave. For our alternative accommodation in a Booking.com, our room night growth rate was 11% in Q3 versus 2019 and the goal mix of alternative accommodations was about 30%, which is slightly higher than Q3 2019. Q3 global mix was about in line with 2021. Q3 gross bookings increased 27% versus 2019 or 41% on a constant currency basis. The 27% increase in gross bookings was 19 percentage points better than the 8% room night increase due to 28% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to 4 points from strong flight growth bookings across the group, partially offset by the 14% points of negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefit by about 2 percentage points from regional mix and about 26 percentage points from rate increases across all of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America. Despite the high ADRs in the third quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of wholesale star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trending down. We'll continue to watch closely. Airline tickets booked in the third quarter were up about 235% versus a smaller base in 2019 and up 45% versus 2021, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the third quarter was over $6 billion, which was up 20% versus 2019 and up about 34% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 110 basis points below Q3 2019 due to a number of factors, including investments in merchandising, which are consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunity for us to lead into a recovering travel market in 2022 and also due to an increase in the mix of flights, the slower recovery of our advertising and other revenues, which have no associated gross bookings and some negative impact from FX rates. Q3 take rates were down more than our expectation of being down about 70 basis points, primarily due to timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition, driven by the improved bookings in Q3, some of which relate to travel in future quarters. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q3 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, increased 27% versus Q3 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with Q3 2019, which was better than our expectations, mainly due to higher-than-expected direct mix. As expected, our marketing ROIs were lower than in Q3 2019, which was in line with our strategy to lead into a recurring travel market in the Q3 peak season. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points compared to Q3 2021, which was in line with our expectations. About 40% of Booking.com's gross bookings are processed through our payments platform in Q3, up from almost 1/3 in Q3 2021. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were better than our expectations of 17% versus Q3 2021, primarily due to a slower-than-expected ramp into our IT expenses and lower-than-expected personnel expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.7 billion in the third quarter, which is better than our expectations and about 7% above 2019 and would have been about 25% above 2019 on a constant currency basis. Non-GAAP net income of $2.1 billion results in non-GAAP earnings per share of about $53 per share, which was up 17% versus Q3 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $2.6 billion in Q3. We recorded GAAP net income of $1.7 million in the quarter, which includes a $336 million unrealized loss on our equity investments, primarily related to Meituan as well as $125 million expense related to an ongoing French tax matter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash investment balance of $11.8 million was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $14.2 billion, primarily driven by about $2 billion in share repurchases in Q3 as well as the unrealized losses on our equity investments. The $2 billion in share purchases in Q3 was a step-up from the $1.3 billion in Q2 as we increased the pace of our repurchases given the pullback in our share price. In October, we repurchased another $595 million worth of our shares, which brings our year-to-date repurchase up to about $4.8 billion and our remaining outstanding authorization to about $5.6 billion. As Glenn mentioned, we reduced our share count by 5% since the end of last year. And over the last 5 years, we reduced our share count by 20% despite suspending our share buyback activity for 21 months during COVID-19 pandemic. With negative $95 million in free cash flow for the third quarter, our earnings for the quarter were offset by about a $2 billion decrease in our deferred merchant booking balance following the peak travel season in Europe and North America. Now on to recent trends on our fourth quarter. We estimate that October room night increased about 12% versus 2019, a slight improvement from the 10% growth in September, driven primarily by the continued recovery in Asia as well as a slight improvement in Europe. In October, all regions were above 2019 levels. The U.S. was of almost 35%, Rest of World was up high teens, and both Asia and Europe were up high single digits. ADR growth has remained around Q3 levels, and we estimate gross bookings were up about 30% in October, which includes negative impacts from FX pressures. We estimate that constant currency gross bookings were up just over 45% in October. While there continues to be uncertainty in the near term, our comments for the quarter make the assumption that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be about 10% above 2019, which is in line with levels of growth we've seen over the last 3 months. Compared with room night growth in Q4 versus 2019 would also be an acceleration on a year-on-year basis from 31% growth in Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021 to 39% growth in Q4 '22 versus Q4 '21. We expect the strength in ADRs we've seen in recent months to generally continue for the remainder of the fourth quarter as well as continued growth in by bookings. We expect about a 15% difference between the level of room night growth and gross booking growth, less than 19% gap in Q3 due to more FX pressure in Q4. We expect FX to pressure gross bookings growth versus 2019 by about 18% in Q4. We expect Q4 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 120 basis points lower than Q4 2019 due to investments in merchandising, an increase in mix of clients and negative impact from timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. We expect Q4 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be a bit higher than in Q4 2019 as we expect to continue to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness due to continued global recovery of travel demand. We expect Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than Q4 2021 due to higher merchant gross bookings mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 20% higher than in Q4 2021, with personnel, G&A and IT each up similar percentage year-on-year. Taking all into account, we expect the Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be over $1.1 billion. If it were not for the impact of FX, we expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be above Q4 2019. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EBITDA margin commentary and still expect EBITDA margin for 2022 to be a few points higher than in 2021. And if not for the impact of timing, our expectations for the full year adjusted EBITDA margins would be higher by another few points. For the full year, we expect our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be just over 14%, lower than our prior expectations for mid-14% range, due primarily to timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition, driven by stronger bookings than previously expected, some of which are related to travel expected to occur in 2023. Compared to the 15.6% take rate in 2019, the expected take rate in 2022 includes almost a full point of noted impact from timing, about 40 basis points from a slower recovery in advertising and other revenue, which have no associated gross bookings and about 30 basis points from increased mix of flights. The benefit to take rates in 2022 from increased revenues associated with payments is offset by our increased investments in merchandising, each of which impacts our reported take rates by about 1% in 2022 compared with about 0.5% each in 2019. These changes in payment revenues and merchant costs versus 2019 are mainly on Booking.com. Looking forward into window months, the booking window continues to be shorter than it was in 2019, which means that we would expect lower levels of future stays already on our books. Given this, we are pleased that the gross bookings we've already received at Booking.com for in Q1, up about 25% in euros versus the same time in 2019. Of course, we note that high percentage of these bookings are cancellable. While this represents a relatively small percentage of the total revenue we record in Q1, we think it's a helpful early data points to share. In closing, we're pleased with our Q3 results and the trends that we're seeing into Q4 and early into 2023. We remain confident that our strategic priority is the right ones and will enable us to provide better travel services for our customers and partners. We'll now move to Q&A. And Sylvie, can you please open the lines? Yes. Thank you, Glenn. I just point that about two-thirds of our expenses are variable, which is caused a very important starting point. We, of course, do look at the fixed payments costs very carefully, but just put that into context. And then also just to clarify, the 25% is actually a Booking.com global number, not just Europe, it's around the whole business. So I think Glenn said what we need to say about the expense side. We will -- we have an agenda to move forward, we really want to continue enhancing our products and services and obviously, that requires continued investments and movement towards further important payments that the connected trip. Relative to the payment platform, of course, we are pleased with the progress. We did give you some additional delay, as you mentioned. So you get a feel for what the revenues are for payments now, also you get a feel of what the corresponding expenses are in sales and others that offset those revenues. Because as we said, this year, we're running the payments platform at about breakeven when you look at revenues and you subtract the sales and other expenses. What I'll also tell you is that relative to 2019, payments is having about 0.5 basis points or about 0.5 point impact on our EBITDA margins as that mix of revenue has increased our breakeven or at mix revenue has increased. Now of course, back in 2019, we actually weren't a breakeven, but the combined impact of where we were to where we are now is about 0.5 point of headwind on our margin, but of course, is giving us additional capabilities. Going forward, room night has not changed. So we do expect to turn to profitability in that combination of payments platform, a combination of revenues, less sales and expenses in 2023. We are rolling out FX and other services on a market-by-market basis. And of course, testing levels we always do before we continue to push them further. We have an exciting road map. It's a multiyear road map for payments. I don't expect anything to change very rapidly in the course of 12 months, it will be a course of multiple years. But if you look at the sources we can provide for our business today in terms of reducing friction for customers and bookers and then we can look at how payments can really help underpin the factor in the future, we're very encouraged and excited about it. I think with the additional disclosure we give you today will be help have a more constructive dialogue upon how it's doing going forward against those benchmarks. Okay. Brian, we can take in reverse order. So Majorelle, you're very close, is basically, from a P&L point of view, this year is just moving around geography because always going through a transition phase, I think we mentioned that about $25 million of personnel expense quarter and about $6 million of G&A expense a quarter move out of those lines respectively and into sales and other. And that started in June 1. Essentially, starting in Q3 and Q4, you see the full impact of that. As we mentioned, the policy Majorelle does have some cost benefits to it, but really most about flexibility. It's about our ability to flexible down quickly, respond to different market needs, different pictures of languages. So over the longer term, compared to continuing to build out ourselves, there are some cost benefits and it'll start occurring in 2023. We haven't quantified yet. We'll think about whether it makes sense to try and quantify the middleware for you next year. But again, it's not the primary driver. So I'm not saying there are no cost managers. That's not why we entered into that partnership. What we sell says the partnership is working exceptionally well. We just completed the summer period, and our customer service results were also solid under the new regime because we did keep some folks ourselves. On the U.S., well, of course, we are growing. So we're investing. I mean it's no big surprise. We haven't broken out contribution margin dollars in different regions. We don't plan to do that. But obviously, we're investing in the U.S. to grow a position, which is continued to increase. And as that increases over time, we'll be able to deliver higher profitability for it. But we're not -- we're not any way this leaves with what we're doing in the U.S. And obviously, it's a market where people do make money, and we do too, just maybe not the same rate as the market we're not investing in price heavily. Sure. Just to finish up on Glenn's point on the market environment. Remember that we did say that our ROIs were a little lower this last point in Q3, as we expected. We targeted lower ROIs obviously that we chose to drive ourselves to continue to lean into the recovery. Also remember, our ROIs were actually, in fact, higher in the first half than they were in 2019. So you have a little bit in that context. Investment levels, we continue to be -- I'd say, we continue to want to invest in the business. But of course, we do recognize some of the backlog factor. We're not going to pull back anything strategic from what we want to do if we have a short-term slowdown. But of course, we are looking at how many people we add and where we are to make sure we are them against the things that really matter most for the business, as you would expect us to do. Yes. Thanks, Glenn. Yes, in terms of -- just as looking forward, on the timing side, I mentioned the timing is costing us about 1 point of take rate this year. We think we have most of that back next year, maybe not 100% of it. There probably be some timing impact. But again, it's really a function of what the growth rates look like going into and going out of the year, but assume we get most of that back. On the marketing and merchandising side combined, that's where we've been leading in this year to really take advantage of a recovering marketplace. We certainly will be deleveraging on those lines further next year. But we want to see really what the market looks like in terms of how much recovery there is left to get it sort of recovering interact travel recovery. There are a few things that have not yet gone back to where they were before. So we'll look at exactly what the right level of investment is. And if we feel that we continue to gain share, we believe we're gaining this year, we believe we gained share last year. We share gains in outlets we have that we may maintain those levels for a while until we get back to a more normal market growth rate. And we'll give you more thinking on where we are on that spectrum when we get together in February we completed our planning process for the year, and we've got a bit more visibility into next year. And then finally, on your Q1 question, yes, Q1 last year was unusual. Omicron was really having an impact. We'll have to see exactly what happens the different variants that are out there this year. We wanted to give you that stats about 25% more gross bookings on the books. For next year, we had the same half of '19 for the first quarter of 2020 as a way to understand the book is building quite nicely for Q1. Obviously, there's a lot of ground to happen between now and their store represents a relatively small percentage of what we'll do in total in Q1 for revenue, but we think it's a -- it's a positive stat. And if a stat we gave out a couple -- actually for the last two quarters and the number was more like 15% forward growth, not 25% and in both cases, the revenue for the quarter wound up being a fair amount higher than our early indicator as those books built. Now again, don't forget -- I'm talking about the euro number, just to be clear, was 25%. Yes. On the mix -- on the trade down, Doug, as you mentioned, we're not seeing that in Europe to be perfectly clear because that's where sometimes people are asking the question, but we're not seeing global either. So it's just not factor, but particularly, it's also not a factor in Europe either. On the ADRs that we got some takes into next year, we'll talk in constant currency because it's difficult to know exactly how exchange rates are going to move on us. We're not really -- so the 28 points of constant currency ADR mix we saw in Q3, and we saw continued roughly same level into October was 26 points from rates and only 2 percentage points from mix. So as ADR continues to rebound, we'll lose that 2-point of mix, which is really what's driving right now, the fact that Asia had a lot of mix down it used to be. So that will go away. But obviously, most of what we're seeing is rate driven. And as we talk to our property partners, they continue to be facing the same expense pressure and inflation pressures that made people face you in terms of utility, energy, labor, et cetera. So we'll see how the environment develops and we have no other color on that to give at this point in time. We'll update you again when we get to February, if we see anything differently. No sense on the note to say that historically, is we've had a heavier weight of mix urban not. So as recovery continues, if people go back to cities and other locations that usually is a positive for us, but no stats on mix. On cross-border, we did tell you that we're back up to 45% of our bookings now in the third quarter. For international, that's down from a little over 50% on a pre-pandemic basis. So there's still some decent recovery left there to we had as things continue to normalize back to where they were. Yes, Lee, I really try to talk about 2023 margins today. That's really a conversation for next February, but maybe longer term, is a place to have to kind of recap on what we're thinking and save the 2023 commentary for them. So as we said, the -- our strategy here is to build a better product and service for customers and partners. So they'll come back to us more frequently and more directly. And obviously, our direct mix is super important and direct mix is tied heavily to frequency and to people who do more with. People who bought a buy multiple things from us are much more likely to come back to us directly in the through the pay channel. So yes, of course, there are some headwinds to our volume profile because of our business mix changing and is changing from almost the pure accommodation business, having a higher mix of payments, a high mix of flights and those are of course lower margin businesses, we've had that conversation before. But most important thing we can do to kind of keep our margins in a strong position is to continue to drive that mix of direct up, and that will impact all parts of the business. But as we said before, we'll be industry-leading profitability and margins. Because of the mix factors, we do not have a -- we believe that medium term, the margin will be a little bit lower than they were in 2019, but we'll have a faster growing business with more EBITDA, more earnings per share that's growing faster than the top line and bottom line, we think that's the most important thing. So yes, sure. The 10% room night guide, it's -- it's really a framework what we give you for Q4. There's still a lot of volatility. And obviously, we can't predict exactly what's going to happen to room nights in November and December, given the back were out there. But what we did was say, look, we grew -- we've been growing at 10% increase up to 12%. It's a nice round number to kind of pin our commentary to with Q4 to explain to you what the shape of the P&L might be. It does not indicate that there was a slowdown at the end of October. In fact, room night growth was fairly linear at 12% throughout the entire month of October. So it's more of a framework than it is a hard guy. But of course, we give you a number to kind of think about when building your models, but it's not reflective of anything we're seeing in October, either slowing down or speeding up. It's just a way to think about the shape of the income statement and how things might look in Q4."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am encouraged by the strong results we are reporting today and by the record level of travel during our peak summer season. In the third quarter, our customers booked 240 million room nights, a little under 0.25 million room nights, which was 8% higher than in Q3 2019. We saw an improvement in room night growth during the third quarter from 4% growth in July to 10% growth in both August and September relative to the comparable months in 2019. We note that sadly, the war in Ukraine continues. And as you know, we suspended our operations in Russia and Belarus shortly after the work we get. If we exclude the suspended areas as well as Ukraine, our room night growth for the quarter would have been 11%. We are pleased that all of our major regions improved in August and September versus July and room nights in Asia surpassed 2019 levels for the first time in September. In the U.S., both our Priceline and Booking.com brands continue to execute well and contributed to room night growth of almost 30% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of 2019. We continue to see very strong accommodation of ADR growth, which helped drive a 27% increase in global gross bookings in the third quarter or 41% on a constant currency basis, both versus Q3 2019. Despite the strong pricing environment, we have not seen evidence of our customers trading down to lower hotel star ratings or reducing the length of their trips. We took another important step in our company's recovery from a profitability perspective with the third quarter being the first time that adjusted EBITDA surpassed pre-pandemic levels. In fact, the third quarter was our highest revenue and adjusted EBITDA quarter ever. Our Q3 revenue and adjusted EBITDA were 20% and 7% higher than Q3 2019 and grew 34% and 25% on a constant currency basis. More recently, we have seen resiliency in the level of demand from travelers with room night growth improving slightly from September levels to about 12% growth estimated for the month of October versus October 2019. Gross bookings in October are estimated to be up about 30% or just over 45% on a constant currency basis. The slight improvement in October was primarily driven by the continued recovery in Asia as well as a slight improvement in Europe. As we take an early look at demand into 2023 at Booking.com, we see strong growth in gross bookings on the books for travel that will take place in the first quarter of next year, though I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancellable. Interestingly, we have strong numbers on our books for early 2023 despite the booking window being shorter than it was at this point in 2019. David will provide further details on our results and on the recent trends we have been seeing. While there is a rising concern around the macroeconomic environment and uncertainty around the consumer spending, we believe the sustained level of demand we have seen through October helps demonstrate our consumers' strong desire to travel further. We believe our solid operating results, substantial liquidity and strong free cash flow positions us well to navigate potential near-term economic uncertainty while we continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform and making progress on our key strategic priorities of payments and the connected tradition. Given our confidence in the positioning of our business, the positive long-term outlook for travel and our strong balance sheet, we have stepped up the pace of our share repurchases since we reinitiated the program at the start of the year. With a $4.2 billion in repurchases for the first 3 quarters of this year, we have reduced our share count by 5% relative to our ending share count last year. We remain focused on building a better experience for our customers and addressing their needs of value, choice and convenience. With continued focus on our customers, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. We are encouraged to see our unique active customers at Booking.com above 2019 levels in the third quarter, which was driven by strong growth in reactivated customers who had not made a booking it over a year as well as growth in repeat customers. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest third quarter level ever. Our goal over time is to further increase our direct mix through several initiatives, including continued efforts to enhance the benefits of our genius loyalty program, further building out our connected vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app. The mobile app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. About 45% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the third quarter, which is just over 10 percentage points higher than in 2019. Booking.com app remains the number one downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm, and we have seen increasing levels of downloads in the U.S. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. We're thinking about addressing our customers' need for value, we believe providing attractive prices on accommodations is very important. As has always been the case, our first priority, as we think about providing attractive prices, is to source competitive rates from our supply partners. We do this by working closely with our supply partners to get the best prices possible and increase participation in our targeted rate programs to ensure that compelling prices are available to our customers. Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com is a great example of a program where hundreds of thousands of our property partners are participating to offer lower rates and other benefits to travelers in ways that meet our property partners specific revenue needs. In addition to sourcing dependent rates directly from our partners, we have built up our ability to selectively offer discounts and incentives at Booking.com over the last few years. Visibility to merchandise is another lever that we can now pull as we look to deliver value to our customers to more competitive pricing. We believe this competitive tool helps us attract and retain customers and drive improved conversion on our platform. Importantly, we take a disciplined approach to merchandising by very closely monitoring the incremental return on investment on that spend, and we can adjust the level of our spend according to our desired return objectives. We have been pleased with the levels of incremental return we have seen this year for merchandising and we'll continue to selectively utilize this tool going forward. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. Alternative accommodations of room night Booking.com grew about 11% versus 2019 and represented about 30% of Booking.com's total room nights in Q3. We have continued to make progress with our alternative accommodation offering by increasing our supply base of properties, which has grown by about 300,000 since the end of 2021 and has increased in each of our major regions around the world over that time period. We aim to build on this growth in our alternative accommodation supply base by improving our product offering to our supply partners globally with a continued focus on the U.S. market. Let me now talk about the progress we have made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. On payments, 40% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the third quarter, which, once again, is our highest quarterly level ever. We believe Booking.com payment services drive benefits for both our travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, we believe that Booking.com's payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger connected tradition. One the connected trip, our long-term vision is to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our customers and supplier partners. We are expanding our offering into travel verticals other than the combinations, and then we'll work to link relevant travel components together to provide a more seamless, flexible consumer experience. As a result of this initiative, we believe, over time, we will drive increases in customer engagement, share of spend and loyalty to our platform. We continue to make progress on building foundations that we connect provision, including our work to integrate ground transportation options and further develop our flight offering on Booking.com. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process. And over 20% of all of our flight bookings globally are new to Booking.com. There is much more work to do as we strive to give our customers the best possible trip experience, but we are pleased with the early results we have seen so far. In closure, I'm encouraged by our strong third quarter results and the sustained levels of travel demand we are seeing into the fall and into early next year. We continue to make progress in several key areas, including engagement with our app, the Genius program, our alternative accommodation offerings, payments at Booking.com and building towards our connected tradition. I believe these initiatives will help us deliver a better offering and experience for our customers and our partners. While there continues to be uncertainty around the near-term macroeconomic environment, we are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. Lloyd, why don't I take the first one. I'll let David talk about payments, then add anything he wants in terms of fixed cost going forward. So obviously, we are very pleased with third quarter and we are very pleased with what we're seeing, albeit it's small numbers into the first quarter. David just talked about that 25% on the books in Europe in euros, I'd like to see that. Your question is, is there anything we're seeing from consumer sentiment or on expanding some macro that may be inhibiting growth or be hurt in the future? And something that's very hard to know is what's the counter factual. And we're doing well measure would be if all these terrible things that we read in the newspapers have not been happening, how much better would it be? I can't measure that? I don't know. What I do know, though, is that we are seeing good numbers, and we're pleased with where we are. We know that we've been through bad times in the past and were able to do very well. We've made adjustments where we've had to. I've been now in this company for 23 years almost. We've had some recessions and we have some real disasters. And we have managed this company extremely well steering it through some very stormy weather and being able to adjust. So many of our expenses are variable, so we can adjust very quickly and we adjust automatically almost as volumes change. But I'm feeling good right now, albeit the world can change any time, and I'll let David now talk to you want to say about specifically fixed expenses and also about payments. One, I just mentioned in general and then if David want to state specific. Look, marketing for travel is always extraordinarily competitive. It's never not competitive. No matter what channel you're spending your money, it's competitive. And we're always trying to make the right judgment and how much money to spend, what we think the ROI is going to be and looking into it for the long view in terms of what this does in terms of our overall building the franchise. I can't give any specifics in terms of up and down. David can talk about percentages of the amount of marketing spend we've been doing versus gross bookings over the last couple of years. But again, the market is never less competitive. It's always competitive, and I think we have performed very, very well regardless. Go ahead, Kevin, please. Do you have the second question? Mark, so you're very right about the importance of the mobile app, and I say that every single prepared remarks call we do, I always mentioned it's an important part of our platform. How we are doing is by creating a great experience for the people who are using it. That's the same thing we all think you're trying to get somebody uses provide a great experience will come back and they'll tell all the people, et cetera. We're not necessarily doing anything really different than anything anyone else does, but just doing it well. In terms of when do -- what would be the top level for it? That's hard to say because as the people who create these mobile devices continue to prove upon it and people find it more advantageous to use that versus their desktops, it's hard to say, but it could be an extremely high number that people go to the mobile device. Now our job is to make sure people use our app use mobile web search where we have to pay, which is one of the key things. We mentioned, I think, over 60% of our business was going in mobile, but 45% is at the app. So obviously, we want to make anybody using the mobile device. We want them to use the app is how to direct them. Regarding flights, I should have checked countries. I haven't done that recently. It's an awful lot, but some of the areas is a relatively low amount because there's very little awareness. I think, for example, I give you an extreme. I know we brought up Pakistan, not that long ago, not a lot of flights yet in Pakistan, but we are getting out there. The key thing for us again is creating a better experience. And I'll be honest with you. Our flight product is not yet, what I would say, as good as it should be. We continue to improve upon it, make it better than it's been in the past, providing the features that some other of our competitors offer up to consumers that we don't do yet that we want to offer. So there's a lot of upside left in this, I think a tremendous amount of upside. And the numbers are still, while we like the growth rates, it's still relatively small. So I'll talk a little bit about merchandising. A couple of things. First thing is, so can be an investment that we're making, a way to bring in customers, retain customers or ways that we feel it necessary to be competitive against other OTAs or our suppliers even. The fact is that we're always looking where to spend the money at the best return. And merchandising, if we see somebody else is off in a lower price, we recognize that one of the most important things is to give a competitive price, and we need to make sure that we're offering that up to the customer. Many times, we want to do my talk with our supplier partners and making sure they bring us as I said in the prepared remarks about bringing us the most competitive prices. But if for some reason is not available, and we feel a need, we'll put money in there to make sure that our customers like to at Booking.com and we'll provide them with a great place to do their travel bookings. That's one. Second thing is I want to make sure everybody understands that merchandising doesn't always mean a discount by us. It can mean lots of things. People offering up some other type of benefit, for example. Although it if somebody were to offer up a upgrade in a room, I'll consider that a merchandising technique to do. If somebody offers a free breakfast at the hotel, I'll consider that too. We're not paying for that breakfast, it's the free breakfast. So parts of ways to do lots of levers to play. That's one of the things we think is so important is making sure that we are providing the most competitive offering out in the space and in addition, being able to use all of our investments in the right way at the right time to get the right return. And as a lot of data to see where is it best to be put out. I'll let David go with the other two questions. So Doug, I'll start with the hotel trading down stars or I have not seen anything in any sort of geographical area that would anything stand out differently. We're seeing people who want to travel to have a significant amount of savings over this COVID period and they want to travel and some are even traveling longer to stay and enjoying it regardless of what the economic situation is. So we -- I have not seen anything and David, you saw I would say anything that where you talk about what we're seeing for ADRs going forward, I'm not sure we've said we were going to say publicly. So Eric, basic concept for us has always been more is better, more supply is better and it's always the consumer's choice of what they want to stay, where they want to stay. They want to stay in a home or villa, apartment or a hotel, that's it. So in terms of overall, we do need to continue working hard at getting more supply of all types. I've talked many times in the past about our need for the single property, the home specifically that we need to build. I talk geography. I've always talked about we need to build in the U.S. even better. And one of the things is creating a better onboarding experience for people who own these properties, improving the payments for these people, coming up with ways they feel better about having some may stay in their property with an insurance type property. These are something that we have been working on that we brought out, and we're going to continue to roll things out down the road to make it better for the owners and the managers of these properties to be willing to put it up on our platform. Now I believe the -- and this is what we've seen over many, many years is that as we bring more and more supply in, that will help us build the business. And I absolutely think that this is something that is not some is going to require some rocket science or some great thing that can't be invented. People are doing this. We just need to continue to work on it, put people to work, create the things necessary, and we will roll this out on the is taking longer than I would like, but I am very pleased with where we are. And I think some of the numbers that we've talked about are encouraging. I'll let Dave talk about stat you want to revolve about urban or. But in term of the app, I'll give you one right off the bat that I think is a -- and again, I look at it as a traveller, I say, what am I missing? Why am I not getting this? Something is simple as, as you know, we have attraction, so we're building that up right now. But in destination, I need to have things being popping up on my screen from our app, telling me great things to do, maybe the discount or skip a line, things that will make somebody say, \"Gee, using Booking.com for this travel experience is much better because I'm getting so much more.\" And I can go through so many different examples of that. The great thing about the mobile app is in people's hands or in their pocket book or in their pocket, they're carrying it with them. And that gives us the connection to be able to provide better service, better things to do, better value. And that's why it's such an important part of this connected trip vision. David, I don't know if you want to give anything from any steps? Well, I mean, we could easily increase that if we didn't do so well in hotels. It's one of those things where we think of this holistically, we want to get more bookings, as I mentioned earlier. This is really a case where the consumer makes the decision, not us. We think one of the great advantages of our platform is that we offer all the different types of accommodations. And we have seen the data where people come to our site. And the first thing they're looking at may be one type of combination, let's say, hotel. They end up booking with a home because they saw that in the search results and they were going back and forth looking around. It's really so that we're very pleased to have that ability to offer up all the types of accommodations to the customer. So I don't see anything to try and artificially try and drive more people to the alternative accommodations necessarily a thing that's going to increase the value of the company. I think providing the customer with what they want, what they need, what they think is best for them is really the right way being consumer-centric and really driving that is the best way to build the company. Yes. So let me talk in general about why we have different brands. We have different brands because they offer a different user experience to the consumer and the different things that they are aiming to do different strategies. We really -- we totally understand the issue of are we calling excess cost? Are there ways to save money by doing things that are not duplicative? So we are -- we understand that. We are working all the time looking at those things that we can try and improve upon. But at this time, I do not see any reason I'd want to separate out and say, well, we're going to at one of these and just go under one brand. Some of our competitors have done that. And to me, that may be there -- our strategy is to continue with the differentiation among these brands and continue to build them out the way they're doing them. In terms of the actual North U.S. for Priceline versus booking, I don't believe we never disclose anything of that nature. So I think we're going to sit tight with that and keep going the way we are. Thank you. And I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for the company. Thank you, everyone, and good night."

And now, I would like to introduce Booking Holdings\u2019 speakers for this afternoon, Mr. Glenn Fogel, CEO and Mr. David Goulden, CFO. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings\u2019 second quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to announce that we reached another milestone in our company\u2019s recovery with room nights for Q2 being the first quarter in which we have surpassed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Our customers booked 246 million room nights in the second quarter, so just shy of 0.25 billion room nights, which represented an increase of 16% versus Q2 2019 and a significant improvement from the 9% decline in Q1. We continue to see very strong accommodation ADR growth, which helped drive an even higher 38% increase in gross bookings in the second quarter or 48% growth on a constant currency basis. Both our room nights and gross bookings in Q2 were our company\u2019s highest quarterly amounts ever for these metrics. While we continue to see bookings growth in July versus 2019, the pace of growth moderated to about 4% for room nights and just over 20% for gross bookings or about 35% growth on a constant currency basis with room night and gross bookings growth slightly improving in the back half of the month versus the comparable weeks in 2019. For the remainder of the summer period through the end of Q3, we see higher gross bookings on the books than at this point in 2019, which we believe will result in a record revenue for the third quarter, which is our seasonally largest revenue quarter. Looking towards the rest of the year, Booking.com, we see solid gross bookings for the fourth quarter, which are about 15% higher than at this same point in 2019 on a euro basis. Though I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable and current FX rates will negatively impact that growth rate in dollars by about 10 percentage points. The booking window remains shorter than it was at this point in 2019, which somewhat limits our visibility into how Q4 will continue to develop. And although conditions could change rapidly, we are cautiously optimistic on the data we are seeing so far. David will provide further details on the recent trends we have been seeing. Now, we recognize that there is uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and questions about the strength of consumer demand through the end of this year and into next year. And while it is extremely difficult to accurately predict the near-term economic environment, I am as confident as ever in consumers\u2019 strong desire to travel, the attractive long-term growth profile of the travel industry and our improving longer term competitive position. With our industry leading margins, high-quality earnings, strong free cash flow and liquidity position and solid balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate any potential near-term economic uncertainty and continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform, while making progress on our key strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. In terms of attracting customers to our platform, our unique active customers at Booking.com surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter, driven by very strong growth in returning customers who have not made a previous booking over a year as well as growth in repeat customers. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest second quarter level ever. We aim to build on increasing our direct mix through several initiatives, including by continuing to enhance the benefits of our Genius loyalty program, further building out our connected trip vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app. In our mobile app, we see the strongest direct repeat customer behavior when compared to our other platforms like desktop or mobile web. Consistent with the first quarter, over 40% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the second quarter which is about 10 percentage points higher than in 2019. Booking.com\u2019s app continue to set new records in terms of monthly active users in Q2 and remains the number one downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. As I said before, the app is a critical platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all the combination types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. Alternative accommodation in room nights, Booking.com grew about 25% versus 2019 and representing about a third of Booking.com\u2019s total room nights in Q2. We continue improving our alternative accommodation product globally with an additional focus on the U.S. market. In the first quarter, we launched partner liability insurance for our alternative accommodation supply partners with global coverage. In the second quarter, we launched enhanced payment solution for professional property managers in the U.S. and have made progress increasing adoption by our partners. Finally, we started rolling out the damage policy option for partners in the second quarter and have continued expanding this option to more countries in the third quarter. Each of these initiatives helps add important features to our alternative accommodation offering, which we believe strengthens our efforts to attract more properties and partners onto our platform. In the second quarter, we saw the largest sequential net increase in alternative accommodation properties since 2019 and we now have 6.6 million alternative accommodation listings on Booking.com. We are encouraged by the increase in alternative accommodation supply that we have seen so far this year and we aim to further build on this growth as we move through the second half of the year. Let me now talk about the progress we have made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. Of this, 38% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the second quarter, which is our highest quarterly level ever. We continue to increase adoption of payments by our property partners, with over 60% of our total Q2 gross bookings coming from properties that have adopted payments. So, this means that about two-thirds of the bookings at payment-enabled properties are being processed via payments. We believe Booking.com\u2019s payment services drive benefits for both our travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions. Furthermore, we believe that Booking.com\u2019s payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger connected trip vision. On the connected trip, I think it\u2019s a helpful reminder to talk to what we are hoping to achieve with this vision. Our vision for the connected trip strives to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable while delivering better value to our customers and a way to provide marketing opportunities to our supplier partners. And as a result, we believe over time we will drive increase in customer engagement, share spend and loyalty. First, we are looking to increase the engagement of customers on our platform by solving more of our customers\u2019 travel problems than just finding the right accommodation of Booking.com as we have done in the past. A simple example of solving a problem and driving additional engagement would be proactively suggesting options for top attractions that can be booked seamlessly in our app while our travelers a destination and looking for something to do. Another example is our testing discounted transportation from the airport to the hotel for say a high-value accommodation customer. And the ground transportation supplier might in the future be providing a discounted price that is specific for our customer, because we are able to provide incremental business. Second, we see the opportunity to increase our share of customers\u2019 travel spend. We estimate that pre-pandemic, our customers\u2019 annual spend on Booking.com represented only about 25% of their total travel spend on average. We believe that by making it easier to book multiple elements of the trip in one place, we can take more part of that travel spend onto our platform. Even in core accommodations and even with top customers, we believe there are opportunities to improve our share of spend over time. And we want to increase customer loyalty and drive a higher direct mix through our app over time. We believe by addressing our customers\u2019 critical needs of value, choice and convenience through our connected trip vision we will deliver an improved experience and increase the likelihood that our customers come back to us again on a direct basis. This year, we continue to make progress as we work on building the foundation of the connected trip, including developing a flight offering of Booking.com. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process and allows us an opportunity to suggest other services to these flight bookers. Flights continues to be a source for new customers with about one quarter or 4 of our flight bookers globally being new to Booking.com with an even higher share of new customers in the U.S. In conclusion, I am encouraged by our strong second quarter results and the record level of summer travel we are seeing now. Our teams are working hard to continue making progress in several key areas, including the app, the Genius program, our alternative accommodation offering, payments at Booking.com and building towards our connected trip vision. Through this work, we believe we are building a better offering for our customers and partners while strengthening our long-term competitive position. While there is uncertainty around the near-term macroeconomic environment, we are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I will review our results for the second quarter and provide some color on trends we have seen so far in the third quarter. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now, on to our results for the second quarter. Room nights in the second quarter were up 16%, a 25 point improvement from Q1 and our first full quarter of room night growth versus 2019. On our May earnings call, we discussed how we started off the quarter with a 10% increase in room nights for the month of April, which was a 14 point improvement from March. As we move into May, we saw further strength in room nights resulting in 22% growth for the month. June room night growth of 14% landed between April and May. For Q2 on a regional basis, room nights in Europe were up over 20%. The U.S. was up about 30%. Rest of world was up in the mid-teens, and Asia was down high single-digits with all regions improving from Q1 levels. The improvement from Q1 was helped by all regions with Europe and Asia contributing the most. Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, represents about 60% of our total room nights in the second quarter. Our apps were over two-thirds of our mobile bookings and over 40% of total room nights, which was in line with the first quarter. In the second quarter, we continued to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel versus Q2 2019 and versus Q2 2021. The international mix of our room nights in Q2 was about 45%, an increase from about 40% in Q1. Q2 international room nights were up mid single-digits compared to Q2 2019 levels, which was the first quarter of growth versus 2019 for international. And these international room nights drove most of the overall improvements in room night growth from Q1 to Q2. The improvement in international room nights we saw continue to be driven by travel within Europe and these cross-border room night bookings continue to have on average longer length of stay and a shorter booking window than comparable bookings in 2019. In Q2, we also saw an encouraging improvement in long-haul international room nights, which almost recovered to 2019 levels. We saw very strong growth in our domestic room nights in the second quarter, also an improvement from Q1. We were pleased to see our cancellation rates below 2019 levels in Q2. You will recall our Q1 cancellation rates were about in line with 2019. In Q2, the booking window of Booking.com moved closer to 2019 levels than it was in Q1, but remained shorter than 2019 across all major regions. The booking window expanded versus the second quarter of 2021. Our alternative accommodations of Booking.com, our room night growth rate was 25% in Q2 versus Q2 2019 and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 32%, which was about in line with Q2 2021 and a couple of percentage points higher than Q2 2019. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodations continues to be meaningfully higher than the global average. In North America, our mix of alternative accommodations remains low relative to global average. However, we did see an encouraging increase in mix versus Q2 2021 in that region. Q2 gross bookings of about $35 billion increased 38% versus Q2 2019 or 48% on a constant currency basis. The 38% increase in gross bookings was 22 percentage points better than the 16% room night increase due to 25% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a few points from strong flight booking growth across the group partially offset by the 10 percentage points of negative impact from FX improvement \u2013 from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about 2 percentage points from regional mix and about 23 percentage points from rate increases across all of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America, especially in high-demand, leisure-oriented destinations. Constant currency ADR growth versus 2019 accelerated from 18% in Q1 to 25% in Q2 due primarily to higher rates in Europe. Despite the higher ADRs in the second quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel start rate levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We will continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up about 190% versus a small base in 2019 and up 31% versus 2021 driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com\u2019s Fly platform. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $4.3 billion, which was up 13% versus 2019, up about 20% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 275 basis points below Q2 2019, down more than our expectations due primarily to the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition driven by stronger bookings than we expected in Q2. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q2 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, increased 27% versus Q2 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings decreased by about 40 basis points versus Q2 2019, which is better than our expectations, mainly due to higher than expected marketing ROIs in a high-intent travel environment. Additionally, our direct mix was a little higher than we expected. Sales and other expenses were up 87% versus Q2 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher third-party call center costs. 38% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q2, up from 16% in Q2 2019. Compared with Q2 2021, sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points, slightly better than our expectations of up 60 basis points. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were better than our expectations, up 7% versus Q2 2021 primarily due to a slower-than-expected ramp-up in terms of our G&A and IT expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion in the second quarter, which is better than our expectations. If we were to normalize for negative timing impact on revenue in the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA would have been meaningfully higher than in Q2 2019. In addition, the changes in FX rates are negatively impacting the translation of our EBITDA to U.S. dollars. Our Q2 EBITDA would have been about 10% higher if FX were in line with Q2 2019. Non-GAAP net income of $776 million results in non-GAAP EPS of about $19 a share, which is down 19% versus Q2 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $1 billion and net income of $857 million in Q2. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash investment balance of $14.2 billion was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $12.8 billion, primarily driven by $2.6 billion of free cash flow, partially offset by about $1.3 billion in share repurchases in Q2. The increase in free cash flow included a $2.1 billion benefit from change in working capital due to the increase in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities, partially offset by the increase in our accounts receivable. We continue to return capital to shareholders and more recently have increased the pace of our repurchase given the pullback in our share price. In addition to the $1.3 billion of share repurchase in Q2, we repurchased another $840 million of our shares in the month of July, which brings our year-to-date repurchases to just over $3 billion and our outstanding authorization to about $7.4 billion. Given our recent increased pace of share repurchases, we now believe we will complete our current authorization in about 2 years from when we started the repurchasing back in January. Now on the recent trends occurred for the third quarter. Juliet room nights increased about 4% versus 2019 or about 7%, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth fluctuated a bit in July and were strong in the second half of the month versus the comp we reached in 2019. ADR growth remained at Q2 levels, and gross bookings were up just over 20% in July, including some help from flights, partly offset by negative impacts of FX pressure. In July, constant currency gross bookings were up about 35%. Compared with June, growth rates in July moderated in all regions with North America showing the smallest change. In July, Europe room night growth was up mid-single digits and up low double-digits, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth in the U.S. was up 25%. Rest of world was up low single digits, and Asia was down about 10%, all versus 2019. When thinking about the rest of Q3, we realized there continues to be volatility in the environment, and our commentary assumes that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be at the same level we saw in July. We do expect the strength in ADRs restore in July to continue for the remainder of the third quarter as well as continued strength in price and flight bookings. We expect the difference between the level of room night growth and gross booking growth for the fourth quarter to be a few percentage points less than the 22% it was in Q2 due to factors, including more FX pressure in Q3. We expect FX pressure gross bookings by about 12% in Q3. In July, the overall booking window Booking.com remained strong than it was in 2019, similar to Q2. We expect Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 70 basis points lower than in Q3 2019 due to investments in merchandising, consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunity for us to lean into a recovering travel market in 2022 and due to an increase in the mix of flights and some impact from FX rates. We expect our underlying accommodation take rates to remain stable. We expect Q3 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings will be slightly above Q3 2019 as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the peak travel season. We expect Q3 sales and other expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than it was in Q3 2021 due to higher gross booking mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 20% higher than Q3 2021 with personnel up about 10% and both G&A and IT up meaningfully versus Q3 of last year. The year-on-year increase in G&A is driven by higher dual sales taxes, which are tied to revenue as well as increased personnel-related expenses due to return to a hybrid work environment. We expect IT expenses to increase year-over-year at a similar rate to what we saw in Q2. Taking all this into account, we would expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be slightly above Q3 2019. As I noted for Q2, the comparison of our Q3 EBITDA expectations to Q3 2019 is negatively impacted by changes in FX rates. At current exchange rates, we expect that our FX-neutral Q3 EBITDA growth versus 2019 will be about 15 percentage points higher than our expectation on a reported basis. We know there is a lot of interest in what will happen beyond the summer. Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings for the Q4 travel period are over 15% higher than they were at this time in 2019 but with a high percentage of cancelable bookings. The booking window is still shorter than it was in 2019, which reduces the amount of gross bookings that we expect on the books for Q4 at this time. The shorter booking window limits our visibility into Q4, and we recognize that conditions could change rapidly. Please note these Booking.com gross booking trends for Q4 period are on a euro basis. On a dollar basis, these growth rates would be about 10 percentage points lower. We are maintaining the full year EBITDA margin commentary we provided in February and May, and we still expect EBITDA margin for 2022 to be a few points higher than in 2021. As a reminder, timing mainly impacts adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins for the year. If it were not for the impact of timing, our expectations for the full year EBITDA margins would be a few points higher than our guidance for the year. As the year has progressed, we revised our allocation of our growth investments between marketing and merchandising. We now expect marketing spend as we\u2019re saying to gross bookings to be about the same as it was in 2019 and expect to spend more on merchandising. This higher merchandising, along with a higher-than-anticipated mix of flights and some negative FX impact, means we expect our take rates for the year will now be in the mid 14% range. Our underlying accommodation take rates remain about the same as we were in 2019. In conclusion, we\u2019re encouraged by our strong Q2 results and by the continued growth above 2019 levels we have seen in July. We remain confident that our focus on customer acquisition and our strategic priorities is the right approach for 2019 \u2013 sorry, for 2022. We will now take your questions. Michelle?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nMark Mahaney: Let me ask two questions, please: one long-term, one short-term. Long-term, how do you increase, Glenn, that your share of annual spend per customer? If it was 25% in the past, what do you think the best way to increase that is? And what\u2019s a reasonable number? Is it 50%? And then secondly, just near-term on the room night, so this deceleration from May to June and then continuing into Q3, could \u2013 is this \u2013 it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re seeing macro issues. So is that a comps issue? Or is it just that you\u2019ve had this really material recovery in travel and now that\u2019s starting to fade and become more \u2013 is starting to become more of a normal growth environment? So just what\u2019s your interpretation of why we\u2019re seeing that deceleration in the room night growth? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you, Mark. And question actually has some interrelated themes. So let\u2019s start a little bit with, I\u2019m going to repeat how happy I am. When we spoke last time, and I talked about April being the first month that we were able to say were recovered beyond 2019. And now we have a full quarter where we\u2019ve done very, very well. As you point out, very strong there. And yes, we see that there is been some moderation, but I will repeat, July gross bookings, 35% on a constant currency basis. That\u2019s pretty strong. And yet we know that the recovery is not fully done yet. We know there are countries around the world that are still somewhat inhibiting travel, making it more difficult. And we know we hear about people saying how hard it\u2019s been in some airports. We read about some of the travelers with cancellations and the crowds and you have to come 5 hours before on the airport, all these things. So, why the deceleration? Hard to say and we can all hypothesize about what that is and why and all that. But I do believe there is tremendous opportunity still in this recovery. And then going into your first question about what share we can get, that is something that we will get even more of because I believe in our future, the idea is that we know travel is going to continue to increase in the long run. We don\u2019t know how steady it will be. We know the volatility we see the last 2 years. This recovery is not a linear straight line up. They are ups and downs, up and downs. And now we have some economic things people are talking about and certainly what the mill pandemic. There is a war, as David pointed out, what things would have been without Russia, Belarus. Look, there is a lot of uncertainty in the short run that\u2019s understood, but the long run is fairly certain that travel will continue to increase. Our job is to continue to improve our products and our services so we get that higher share of our current customers get more customers and get a lot of their share to. How do we do that? All the things I talked about. I talk about building out that connected trip. I talk about making the app better. We talk about payments. We talk all things we\u2019re doing. And we\u2019re seeing us gain think that share and we see it has improved. Now what is the ultimate \u2013 what we talk 25 should that go? Somebody individual look, this is the average. Some customers, I\u2019m certain, were getting a huge amount of it, some customers less so. And it certainly depends on what kind of product our customers are looking for. And we\u2019ve mentioned in the past that we know in some parts of the world, our alternative accommodations, is not where I want to be yet. We\u2019re working on that to make that better. So sometimes uncertain customers say, I\u2019m going to use Booking.com this type of stay, and I\u2019m going to use some competitor for this other type of stay. That\u2019s an area we can do better and get more share. So I\u2019m not going to come back and say, my goal is x percentage but will come back and say, I absolutely we\u2019re on the right path, and we are growing that share, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that in the long run. David, anything you want to add to that?\nDavid Goulden: No.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Glenn.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. It looks like your bookings-to-ad spend ratio was about 19.9% in Q2. That\u2019s up from 18.3%. So it looks like getting progress there, but maybe investing more in merchandising and that\u2019s impacting your take rate. Can you explain why you think this is the right strategy for the company shifting a little bit to merchandising? And then second, it does appear you could be gaining some share of room nights in the U.S. And just trying to think about how you think about those customers repeating. Do you have confidence that spending and getting market share is going to result in better repeat rates next year and you\u2019ll be able to keep those customers? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So actually, your last question actually applies to the earlier part, which is part of our decision how we spend our money, whether it be dollars, euro again, whatever, how do we spend it? To point people to our platform and get them to buy something is factored by what do we think we\u2019re going to get in terms of the return. And when they return is, are they going to come back? Or else they going to come back? Are they coming back direct or not? Do they now make want to pay from the cannot? All of these types of things go into our calculations around our machine learning, all the science we bring in to try and decide what is the best use of the money? And we\u2019re looking, obviously, the markets are dynamic. I haven\u2019t used that word in a while, but we\u2019re going to use it today right now. These markets are dynamic. And whether it\u2019s a performance marketing market you\u2019re looking at or any other type of market in terms of what is the best way to put that money to work to get the best long-term value for our company. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now. And clearly, David pointed out that we\u2019re leaning more toward some merchandising right now because we believe that is the appropriate use of our money right now to get the best return in the long run for the company. And obviously, one factor is getting to come back again and again, and that\u2019s the important point in trying to make sure that we use the money correctly.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. And maybe a follow-up, are you seeing higher repeat rates? I know it\u2019s early in the transition, but are you seeing higher repeat rates?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, I\u2019m going to say that we believe the repeat rates are appropriate for the money we\u2019re spending, and we\u2019re comfortable with how we\u2019re spending it. How about that?\nJustin Post: Great. Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of UBS. Please go ahead.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. So you guys have talked in the past about looking to grow room nights in 2023 faster than what you were doing in \u201819. I guess, is that still your ambition? Does the macro make it harder to kind of expect that? And any kind of medium-term outlook you can share? And then secondly, recognizing there is a balance with using the margin for merchandising, but what is the latest update around payments margin, turning that to profitability maybe with FX translation or other value-added services? Are you guys starting to roll those out, thinking about it? What\u2019s the latest thought process and timing there? Thanks.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Lloyd, let me take both of those. So our goal is absolutely to when we have a fully recovered marketplace, whenever that is, and that gets back to your question about 2023, will that be the case? We don\u2019t know yet. But our view is that when we get back to a more stabilized market growth level, at that point in time, we would expect to be growing fast than we were in 2019. That\u2019s still very much our strategy, our statement based upon the things that Glenn talked about moving forward with the product, building out the connected trip, having a more comprehensive offering and also doing more with payments, which gets back to the second part of your question. So that goal is absolutely out there. Our goal is to be growing on the top line and the bottom line faster than we were in 2019 when we\u2019re into a fully normalized recurrent market environment. So we believe that we can do that. In terms of where are we on the payments platform, we continue to be pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making. We expect to run our payments platform very close to breakeven this year. And we expect to start seeing some positive returns to the payments platform in aggregate in 2023. Some of that will just come through better economics in the core processing of payments, and some of that would be from starting to introduce in a bit more scale. Some of the payment-oriented products that we\u2019re currently experimenting rolling out, we\u2019re currently working on FX options for our customers, paying your own currency-type solutions, buy now, pay later type offerings. Those are the first two we\u2019re experimenting with in different markets right now. We expect to roll it out a little bit more fully in 2023. And the combination of that and some things will also add in 2023 on top of that will move us into a positive position relative to getting a return from payments platform next year.\nLloyd Walmsley: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks a lot. Just follow-up on the marketing question, you talked about in the second quarter the kind of high-intent environment. Can you dig into that? Exactly you were seeing there that allows that add ROIs to outperform in Q2 and how has that trended into Q3? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nGlenn Fogel: Did you guys \u2013 he kind of broke up.\nDavid Goulden: No. I missed the last part, Kevin. How does that turn into and then you cut out?\nKevin Kopelman: Sorry, so if you could dig into the high-intent environment that you described in the second quarter and how \u2013 what the drivers were and how that has looked into the third quarter.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you. Let me take that, Glenn, add some color. So we would please see the ROIs better than our expectation in the second quarter and to get some leverage on that marketing spend. It\u2019s obviously the biggest single line in our income statement. And we characterize it as a high-intent environment in Q2 because there is no single factor that kind of led to that. It\u2019s a multiplicity of things. As you know, the calculation of ROI is based upon many, many different variables. Some of the ones that made a difference to the positive in the second quarter, having a lower cancellation rate helped with ROIs. We saw some strengthening length of stays versus what we were expecting and also versus 2019. And some of the ADR trends also helped us. There are other factors as well. But I\u2019d point out those three as ones that certainly had a meaningful impact on the overall ROI environment. And just to a lot of people, a lot of volume in environment. And as we said, people were booking and they weren\u2019t canceling. That\u2019s going to be part of what we mean by high intent. In the third quarter, we still expect that to be the biggest travel season from a room state point of view. It always is. The market is still recovering. As Glenn said, it\u2019s not linear. But the trend line is certainly going up positively, which is what we like to see. And like last quarter, we think there\u2019ll be an opportunity to attract bookers to the platform. Bear in mind for a number of people still be a couple of years since they have made their last booking, and they may not automatically come back. So we\u2019ve got a regain some existing customers. There is the opportunity to win new customers in the peak travel season. So our plan is still to lean in as we said we would do at the start of the season. We expect, in total, that leaning in on marketing to be a little less impactful on the P&L than we did for the full year and been on our merchandising to be a little more, but we will still have both of them turn up pretty high in the third quarter.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. And then a quick follow-up on the merchandising in the mix, how should we be thinking about that as a percentage of the mix? What is the kind of level you\u2019re looking at? And would you \u2013 as it\u2019s gotten more important, is this something you consider disclosing?\nDavid Goulden: Again, I missed the first part of the question. I think Glenn, did as well. I apologize.\nKevin Kopelman: Apologies. So, could you give us a sense of merchandising, how big it could be in the mix or what you are envisioning? And then as it\u2019s become more \u2013 is it something you would consider disclosing? Thanks.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Thank you. I got the question, merchandising. Obviously, it\u2019s something that we use selectively. We will think about further disclosure as it grows. Obviously, this year is something that we will \u2013 but think of it as something we are leaning into this year in a recovering marketplace, just like marketing. As and when things have recovered, we may not have to lead in quite heavily. So, we kind of see this may also fluctuate. We have not broken it out. Yes, it does obviously have a bit of an impact upon take rates. And probably the way to give you some flavor on it in the future is to give you a bit more flavor as to how it\u2019s impacting take rate, but nothing more to disclose at this point in time.\nGlenn Fogel: I would say one thing in turn generally in merchandise. But in general, when we talk about one of the values in the connected trip, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks about providing a marketing platform for suppliers to be able to do what they feel is appropriate in terms of maximizing their value and us providing them an opportunity to do their own way to merchandise and offer up different types of offers to our customers. And we will use all sorts of important scientific analysis of where it\u2019s really incremental for them. And that I believe is something that\u2019s going to be very helpful going and run, particularly if we are in a less of a hot market where everybody feels we can sell at maximum price. When things start getting a little more interesting, that will be another opportunity for us to provide value to our supplier partners.\nDavid Goulden: And just final, as we build out the elements of the connected trip, that gives us more ways to merchandise. At the moment, a lot of our merchandises through pricing type activity, but as Glenn mentioned, we are looking at providing incentives or other benefits to our high-value accommodation customers, if they are buying more elements of the total trip. So, the mix of how we merchandise on our side will also change over time as well.\nKevin Kopelman: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. Good evening guys. So, just a couple I wanted to follow-up on. Pretty strong U.S. numbers and you are talking about the 30% growth and even the 25% growth in July. Maybe just talk to us about what are sort of some of the unique drivers around that U.S. business at this point. Are you seeing outsized Genius adoption? Is the merchandising having an impact there? Is air a disproportionate driver? Like what is sort of one or two of the key funnel drivers you are seeing in the U.S. for that type of growth is the first one. And then the second one, and maybe you said it, I know you guys gave so many helpful numbers. Can you just sort of talk to us about the growth rates you are seeing on cross-border travel versus intra-continental travel across the entire company? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. So, let me take the first one, and David can do the second one. I know he talked a little bit in what sort of details you want to give on that second one. On the first one, I will make the point that several years ago, I said that it was just hard for us to do better in the U.S. That would be a strategic priority for us to get more share we are under-indexed in the U.S. We felt we have a very good product, but now improve upon it. And that is something that we should be doing better we would. And now we are beginning to see some of that. We are seeing these kind of growth rates that you just mentioned, and that is something that I am very happy that the team has executed well. Now what is the silver bullet, there is no silver bullet. It\u2019s a lot of things. There is a tremendous number of different things being worked out by so many different teams. And I can \u2013 we can spend all through the rest of this call talking about all the things that have been done by the different people to improve so we can get higher share. And you have seen some of it yourself. You see our brand marketing. You see the things that we are doing in terms of app. You see us in terms of being payments out. We have Booking.com and have payments in the space, and we have that. And assuming those things is the blocking and tackling every day, working with the suppliers, achieving better relationships so that we work together so we can offer up to travelers something that really fits what their needs are. And I can\u2019t come out and help you in terms of \u2013 this is the biggest part, the next part and the next part. What I can say is that this is something that has been something that\u2019s been important to us, but I am glad to see the results starting to come through. It\u2019s not done by any way, shape or form. There is a lot more to be done, and I continue to repeat myself about we got to do better in the alternative accommodations in the states. Not enough people know about it, and we have enough supply and all those areas we want to improve upon there. And obviously, flights started up for Booking.com in the States and is doing well, but a lot more to do there. And all those things that connected trips. So, lots more to be done there, but that is an area where we are going to continue. As I said, it\u2019s one of our priorities, one of the things we are working hard on it. And I am happy to see to be able to show people, here is what the growth \u2013 the progress that we have made so far.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Thanks, Glenn. Brian, yes, on international travel, Q2 is probably the best place to come look because we have got the full quarter numbers to talk about. International, that was the first quarter that we saw growth in international travel in total vis-\u00e0-vis 2019. So, in Q2, international travel in total was a mid-single digit growth. Of course, the room nights in aggregate were up 16 points. Obviously, domestic was still strong, very strong, but it was the first quarter we saw return to growth of international travel in aggregate. And to your point, within international travel, we saw better-than-average growth in the \u2013 within regional travel, so travel within Europe and Asia, etcetera. And the long-haul international travel was still down mid-single digits, but was \u2013 still was almost recovered back to 2019 levels. So, I think it\u2019s an encouraging trends as we move through the quarter. As I mentioned, in terms of the overall improvement from Q1 to Q2, international travel drove most of that improvement.\nBrian Nowak: Thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking my questions. Glenn, can you just elaborate a little bit around your thoughts on ADR strength and the sustainability and just kind of how things get a little bit more interesting? I think as you said, in a potentially less hot market. And then, David, I just want to ask about payments. I think you said kind of close to breakeven this year, some positive returns in \u201823. Can you just talk about how you are kind of working through the initial dilutive nature there from a margin perspective? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: So, a couple of thoughts about ADR. Obviously, we talked about ADR, a very global average-type thing. But it\u2019s interesting, when you look around the world, it\u2019s not the same everywhere. In Asia, very different than what\u2019s happened in States, let\u2019s say, differences in Europe, too. It is interesting that in almost all the time I have been in the travel industry, when you had lower occupancy rates, that would usually end up with lower ADRs. People try to fill up those last rooms because the margin that would drop to the bottom line was huge. Yet, that is not what\u2019s happening here. You see occupancy rates, for example, in the States, still not at historical highs, yet we all know ADRs certainly are. And that\u2019s an interesting change from how they have been in the past. And now your question is a good one. Well, what\u2019s going to happen in the future? Are these things going to come back \u2013 are these ADRs going to come back down now at some point, if demand does drop, are we going to see that come back down, or are the hoteliers going to continue what they have been doing with us saying, look, I can\u2019t even service for all of my rooms. So, I am not going to try and fill them. But I don\u2019t want to know on labor or labor cost. It\u2019s better or doing better by doing this higher ADRs and not trying to fill everything. That\u2019s happening in some of the places. The truth is, nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen in the future. I do know, though, that we have flexibility ourselves, that we work well when there is \u2013 ADRs are high, as you have seen with the numbers we just printed, which is great. And also when ADRs are dropping because the suppliers need more demand, we are there to help them. We did better than most of the people in the industry coming straight out of the depth of the pandemic because we worked really hard with these suppliers to find a way to get the demand, and we did that. And that\u2019s really our role with them is to make sure we are putting heads and beds for them at the price that they think is right. And that\u2019s what we are going to continue to do. So, I can\u2019t tell you what\u2019s going to happen in the future. I can tell you, we will continue to execute well under either scenario.\nDavid Goulden: And Doug, on payments, I think that is not a new story. The fact that we are going to have some revenue streams that are going to be growing faster than the current average because they are newer and they will be less profitable from a profit margin point of view. We talked about payments of flights earlier during the year that are both going to be significant contributors to the business in the future will result in incremental EBITDA dollars \u2013 incremental EBITDA dollar growth, but will be dilutive to margin rates. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s anything new. And I think that\u2019s a good thing for the business. It means we will have faster EPS growth for having those businesses than we would without. So, I think it\u2019s a conversation we had a few times in the early part of the year and hopefully nothing new. We are making progress and getting payments into the position we talked we thought we might be able to go into 2023. So, I view that as encouraging.\nDoug Anmuth: Great. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Naved Khan of Truist. Please go ahead.\nNaved Khan: Yes. Hi. Thanks a lot. Glenn, in the past, heat waves have hurt bookings. I go back to 2018, 2019, I think that has happened. And this year, do you think there is any impact on the heat wave or maybe flight cancellations in the July trends that you just shared? And just give us your thoughts on that. And then if we just look at the U.S. room night growth, how should I think about the contribution from get it room? Is that \u2013 how much of a factor is that?\nGlenn Fogel: So, I can answer the second one first because I heard that one well, and I want to go back and get that first question again. Again, we are very pleased with how it\u2019s working, very nice, but that is not a big driver at all in these numbers. So \u2013 and I will let David work sort of specificity, but I would say do not \u2013 that is not the \u2013 it\u2019s nice. It\u2019s good. I am very happy how we are doing. I am pleased. I love the guys, doing great. It is very helpful in our B2B strategic partnership area. Helping us build out that part of our business to be a very competitive part of the business with others too, it\u2019s one element. We had that part of the business for a long time before. This is just one addition to our overall B2B area. So, that\u2019s something I am there. I will let \u2013 David, do you want to say on that and get\u2026?\nDavid Goulden: Sorry. Fine. It\u2019s only a few points of incremental growth in the U.S.\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So, if we can, can you say the first question because I think I heard flight cancellations. I am not sure what you said. Could you go back to?\nNaved Khan: Yes. It\u2019s really about if there is any impact from either the heat wave in Europe or flight cancellations that we are seeing in the July numbers, just give us some color.\nGlenn Fogel: Oh, I have got it now. Okay. So, it goes back to me trying to explain and talk about the non-linearity of the heats [ph] in January because yes, we see the change, and I talked at the beginning about that. And one hypothesis, certainly, somebody in the past, people have definitely talked about, well, when it\u2019s hot, people don\u2019t travel as much. That\u2019s true. There is definitely there that in there. And there certainly is the cancellation of the Air Force Macassar, and that probably played a factor too. There are a lot of things that are probably played \u2013 and we want to look at how strong May was. And did that take some bookings from July we ended up in May because people were just \u2013 as soon as the pandemic levels went down, and so I am calling it down. People say I am going right away and won they would have waited. There is so many potential hypothesis. I can\u2019t tease them all out. And in fact, I would say it\u2019s actually not that \u2013 it\u2019s not that important because we are talking for the long run, one month versus another month. In my mind, yes, I know there was going to be volatility in these things, variability. But we are looking at the long run. Are we achieving what we want to continue to open the long run, build this business? And we are doing that. And I see that. So I can\u2019t really help you on whatever guess is you would like yourself, but what\u2019s more important in my mind is are we executing, creating a better product, a better service that we will get more share as the travel recovery continues, which it is. And again, I emphasize this recovery from the pandemic is nowhere near done yet. When you look at countries like, in Japan, there are a lot of places where it\u2019s not where everybody isn\u2019t just traveling as they used to at all. In Asia, we mentioned Asia. It\u2019s not a full recovery yet. Look at China, lots of places where the pandemic has not totally disappeared. Everybody is living like they did in 2019 at all, but there is a lot of room to come back just from recovery, and we are looking forward to that.\nNaved Khan: Great. Thank you for your thoughts.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for taking my question. This is Jack Halpert on for Deepak. I just wanted to ask, can you guys talk about any shifts in the consumer demand you are seeing between your alternative accommodations and hotels booking as things sort of normalized a bit from COVID? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Well, I think we talked a little bit about what share of our business in the alternative accommodations now and how we saw a couple of percentage points better than 2019 to more accommodations versus hotels. That\u2019s steady improvement that we are pleased we are seeing. We talked a little bit about the U.S. and the mix there. It\u2019s still low in terms of the share that\u2019s going to internal accommodations, but we are pleased with the mix is improving. It\u2019s on the right path. I am not sure in terms of general, though I think I know your question is, is this going to be \u2013 are people going back to where they formerly had done a lot more hotels and are they going to switch back there? I don\u2019t think anybody knows or not. But what I emphasize is how important it is to offer both. And that\u2019s why we think we have an advantage because we know, and I mentioned this in previous calls, we know people come to our site thinking they want one type of accommodation, yet we see by the way they search and the way they look at different potential places to stay, that there is actually a lot of uncertainty. And by offering both a hotel and a home or apartment or avail, whatever it is, we are providing better information to the travelers to be able to make the right choice and have a higher opportunity that they will buy from us because we are offering these different types of services. So, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in terms of people\u2019s behavior going back. I can guess. I think that people who have enjoyed a home they never get before, they are going to continue to look at that home. And I am fine with that because we offer it. So, it\u2019s okay by me if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. What I would like to do, of course, is make our home products be top brand \u2013 be as good as anybody else\u2019s and make sure that nobody ever says, I gave you all of that, here are some things you don\u2019t have yet. That\u2019s something I want to get rid of.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Lee Horowitz of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLee Horowitz: Thanks for the questions. Two, if I could. Can you comment at all on how hotel attach rates are pacing for your air product relative to your expectations and how you think about continuing to improve those from here? And then just one on costs, if I could. Just given the directional commentary you have given us on fixed costs for this year, looking beyond this year, how do you think about the kind of sustainable level of fixed cost growth into a more normalized demand environment? Thanks so much.\nGlenn Fogel: Well, I will take the first one. I will let David do the second one. And what we have said, and it hasn\u2019t changed, what we said in the past is that we are a meaningful percentage of bookers who first book a flight then book an accommodation. And we are saying for new customers, we see that an encouraging percentage of them are attaching an accommodation to the flight booking, which is what I said in the past and I will say the same because it\u2019s pretty much the same. And David, on your side?\nDavid Goulden: Yes. On my side, obviously, the base element in our fixed cost is personnel. And in recent years, with the current inflation rates and obviously wage inflation, that has been pressured particularly for tech and technology people and product people, the marketing folks, etcetera, engineers. So, that\u2019s been under pressure for a little while. We believe that when we get back to this post-COVID steady state and we get to the situation where we are gaining share, growing top line faster than we used to grow in the bottom line faster than we used to, we believe that we can start looking at the right time of getting leverage from our fixed costs. But at the moment, we are obviously facing some short-term pressures.\nLee Horowitz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Glenn Fogel for closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel: Well, thank you. So, after the difficult situation in the last 2.5 years, we are very pleased to arrive at where we are today. And I want to thank our partners, our customers, dedicated employees and our shareholders. We greatly appreciate the support as we continue to build on our long-term vision for our company. Thank you everyone and good night.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for this afternoon.

            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I will review our results for the second quarter and provide some color on trends we have seen so far in the third quarter. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now, on to our results for the second quarter. Room nights in the second quarter were up 16%, a 25 point improvement from Q1 and our first full quarter of room night growth versus 2019. On our May earnings call, we discussed how we started off the quarter with a 10% increase in room nights for the month of April, which was a 14 point improvement from March. As we move into May, we saw further strength in room nights resulting in 22% growth for the month. June room night growth of 14% landed between April and May. For Q2 on a regional basis, room nights in Europe were up over 20%. The U.S. was up about 30%. Rest of world was up in the mid-teens, and Asia was down high single-digits with all regions improving from Q1 levels. The improvement from Q1 was helped by all regions with Europe and Asia contributing the most. Mobile bookings, particularly through our apps, represents about 60% of our total room nights in the second quarter. Our apps were over two-thirds of our mobile bookings and over 40% of total room nights, which was in line with the first quarter. In the second quarter, we continued to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel versus Q2 2019 and versus Q2 2021. The international mix of our room nights in Q2 was about 45%, an increase from about 40% in Q1. Q2 international room nights were up mid single-digits compared to Q2 2019 levels, which was the first quarter of growth versus 2019 for international. And these international room nights drove most of the overall improvements in room night growth from Q1 to Q2. The improvement in international room nights we saw continue to be driven by travel within Europe and these cross-border room night bookings continue to have on average longer length of stay and a shorter booking window than comparable bookings in 2019. In Q2, we also saw an encouraging improvement in long-haul international room nights, which almost recovered to 2019 levels. We saw very strong growth in our domestic room nights in the second quarter, also an improvement from Q1. We were pleased to see our cancellation rates below 2019 levels in Q2. You will recall our Q1 cancellation rates were about in line with 2019. In Q2, the booking window of Booking.com moved closer to 2019 levels than it was in Q1, but remained shorter than 2019 across all major regions. The booking window expanded versus the second quarter of 2021. Our alternative accommodations of Booking.com, our room night growth rate was 25% in Q2 versus Q2 2019 and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 32%, which was about in line with Q2 2021 and a couple of percentage points higher than Q2 2019. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodations continues to be meaningfully higher than the global average. In North America, our mix of alternative accommodations remains low relative to global average. However, we did see an encouraging increase in mix versus Q2 2021 in that region. Q2 gross bookings of about $35 billion increased 38% versus Q2 2019 or 48% on a constant currency basis. The 38% increase in gross bookings was 22 percentage points better than the 16% room night increase due to 25% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a few points from strong flight booking growth across the group partially offset by the 10 percentage points of negative impact from FX improvement \u2013 from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about 2 percentage points from regional mix and about 23 percentage points from rate increases across all of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America, especially in high-demand, leisure-oriented destinations. Constant currency ADR growth versus 2019 accelerated from 18% in Q1 to 25% in Q2 due primarily to higher rates in Europe. Despite the higher ADRs in the second quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel start rate levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We will continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up about 190% versus a small base in 2019 and up 31% versus 2021 driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's Fly platform. Consolidated revenue for the second quarter was $4.3 billion, which was up 13% versus 2019, up about 20% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 275 basis points below Q2 2019, down more than our expectations due primarily to the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition driven by stronger bookings than we expected in Q2. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q2 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, increased 27% versus Q2 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings decreased by about 40 basis points versus Q2 2019, which is better than our expectations, mainly due to higher than expected marketing ROIs in a high-intent travel environment. Additionally, our direct mix was a little higher than we expected. Sales and other expenses were up 87% versus Q2 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher third-party call center costs. 38% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q2, up from 16% in Q2 2019. Compared with Q2 2021, sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points, slightly better than our expectations of up 60 basis points. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were better than our expectations, up 7% versus Q2 2021 primarily due to a slower-than-expected ramp-up in terms of our G&A and IT expenses. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion in the second quarter, which is better than our expectations. If we were to normalize for negative timing impact on revenue in the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA would have been meaningfully higher than in Q2 2019. In addition, the changes in FX rates are negatively impacting the translation of our EBITDA to U.S. dollars. Our Q2 EBITDA would have been about 10% higher if FX were in line with Q2 2019. Non-GAAP net income of $776 million results in non-GAAP EPS of about $19 a share, which is down 19% versus Q2 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $1 billion and net income of $857 million in Q2. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash investment balance of $14.2 billion was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $12.8 billion, primarily driven by $2.6 billion of free cash flow, partially offset by about $1.3 billion in share repurchases in Q2. The increase in free cash flow included a $2.1 billion benefit from change in working capital due to the increase in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities, partially offset by the increase in our accounts receivable. We continue to return capital to shareholders and more recently have increased the pace of our repurchase given the pullback in our share price. In addition to the $1.3 billion of share repurchase in Q2, we repurchased another $840 million of our shares in the month of July, which brings our year-to-date repurchases to just over $3 billion and our outstanding authorization to about $7.4 billion. Given our recent increased pace of share repurchases, we now believe we will complete our current authorization in about 2 years from when we started the repurchasing back in January. Now on the recent trends occurred for the third quarter. Juliet room nights increased about 4% versus 2019 or about 7%, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth fluctuated a bit in July and were strong in the second half of the month versus the comp we reached in 2019. ADR growth remained at Q2 levels, and gross bookings were up just over 20% in July, including some help from flights, partly offset by negative impacts of FX pressure. In July, constant currency gross bookings were up about 35%. Compared with June, growth rates in July moderated in all regions with North America showing the smallest change. In July, Europe room night growth was up mid-single digits and up low double-digits, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth in the U.S. was up 25%. Rest of world was up low single digits, and Asia was down about 10%, all versus 2019. When thinking about the rest of Q3, we realized there continues to be volatility in the environment, and our commentary assumes that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be at the same level we saw in July. We do expect the strength in ADRs restore in July to continue for the remainder of the third quarter as well as continued strength in price and flight bookings. We expect the difference between the level of room night growth and gross booking growth for the fourth quarter to be a few percentage points less than the 22% it was in Q2 due to factors, including more FX pressure in Q3. We expect FX pressure gross bookings by about 12% in Q3. In July, the overall booking window Booking.com remained strong than it was in 2019, similar to Q2. We expect Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 70 basis points lower than in Q3 2019 due to investments in merchandising, consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunity for us to lean into a recovering travel market in 2022 and due to an increase in the mix of flights and some impact from FX rates. We expect our underlying accommodation take rates to remain stable. We expect Q3 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings will be slightly above Q3 2019 as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the peak travel season. We expect Q3 sales and other expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than it was in Q3 2021 due to higher gross booking mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 20% higher than Q3 2021 with personnel up about 10% and both G&A and IT up meaningfully versus Q3 of last year. The year-on-year increase in G&A is driven by higher dual sales taxes, which are tied to revenue as well as increased personnel-related expenses due to return to a hybrid work environment. We expect IT expenses to increase year-over-year at a similar rate to what we saw in Q2. Taking all this into account, we would expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be slightly above Q3 2019. As I noted for Q2, the comparison of our Q3 EBITDA expectations to Q3 2019 is negatively impacted by changes in FX rates. At current exchange rates, we expect that our FX-neutral Q3 EBITDA growth versus 2019 will be about 15 percentage points higher than our expectation on a reported basis. We know there is a lot of interest in what will happen beyond the summer. Booking.com's gross bookings for the Q4 travel period are over 15% higher than they were at this time in 2019 but with a high percentage of cancelable bookings. The booking window is still shorter than it was in 2019, which reduces the amount of gross bookings that we expect on the books for Q4 at this time. The shorter booking window limits our visibility into Q4, and we recognize that conditions could change rapidly. Please note these Booking.com gross booking trends for Q4 period are on a euro basis. On a dollar basis, these growth rates would be about 10 percentage points lower. We are maintaining the full year EBITDA margin commentary we provided in February and May, and we still expect EBITDA margin for 2022 to be a few points higher than in 2021. As a reminder, timing mainly impacts adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins for the year. If it were not for the impact of timing, our expectations for the full year EBITDA margins would be a few points higher than our guidance for the year. As the year has progressed, we revised our allocation of our growth investments between marketing and merchandising. We now expect marketing spend as we're saying to gross bookings to be about the same as it was in 2019 and expect to spend more on merchandising. This higher merchandising, along with a higher-than-anticipated mix of flights and some negative FX impact, means we expect our take rates for the year will now be in the mid 14% range. Our underlying accommodation take rates remain about the same as we were in 2019. In conclusion, we're encouraged by our strong Q2 results and by the continued growth above 2019 levels we have seen in July. We remain confident that our focus on customer acquisition and our strategic priorities is the right approach for 2019 \u2013 sorry, for 2022. We will now take your questions. Michelle? No. Yes. Lloyd, let me take both of those. So our goal is absolutely to when we have a fully recovered marketplace, whenever that is, and that gets back to your question about 2023, will that be the case? We don't know yet. But our view is that when we get back to a more stabilized market growth level, at that point in time, we would expect to be growing fast than we were in 2019. That's still very much our strategy, our statement based upon the things that Glenn talked about moving forward with the product, building out the connected trip, having a more comprehensive offering and also doing more with payments, which gets back to the second part of your question. So that goal is absolutely out there. Our goal is to be growing on the top line and the bottom line faster than we were in 2019 when we're into a fully normalized recurrent market environment. So we believe that we can do that. In terms of where are we on the payments platform, we continue to be pleased with the progress that we're making. We expect to run our payments platform very close to breakeven this year. And we expect to start seeing some positive returns to the payments platform in aggregate in 2023. Some of that will just come through better economics in the core processing of payments, and some of that would be from starting to introduce in a bit more scale. Some of the payment-oriented products that we're currently experimenting rolling out, we're currently working on FX options for our customers, paying your own currency-type solutions, buy now, pay later type offerings. Those are the first two we're experimenting with in different markets right now. We expect to roll it out a little bit more fully in 2023. And the combination of that and some things will also add in 2023 on top of that will move us into a positive position relative to getting a return from payments platform next year. No. I missed the last part, Kevin. How does that turn into and then you cut out? Thank you. Let me take that, Glenn, add some color. So we would please see the ROIs better than our expectation in the second quarter and to get some leverage on that marketing spend. It's obviously the biggest single line in our income statement. And we characterize it as a high-intent environment in Q2 because there is no single factor that kind of led to that. It's a multiplicity of things. As you know, the calculation of ROI is based upon many, many different variables. Some of the ones that made a difference to the positive in the second quarter, having a lower cancellation rate helped with ROIs. We saw some strengthening length of stays versus what we were expecting and also versus 2019. And some of the ADR trends also helped us. There are other factors as well. But I'd point out those three as ones that certainly had a meaningful impact on the overall ROI environment. And just to a lot of people, a lot of volume in environment. And as we said, people were booking and they weren't canceling. That's going to be part of what we mean by high intent. In the third quarter, we still expect that to be the biggest travel season from a room state point of view. It always is. The market is still recovering. As Glenn said, it's not linear. But the trend line is certainly going up positively, which is what we like to see. And like last quarter, we think there'll be an opportunity to attract bookers to the platform. Bear in mind for a number of people still be a couple of years since they have made their last booking, and they may not automatically come back. So we've got a regain some existing customers. There is the opportunity to win new customers in the peak travel season. So our plan is still to lean in as we said we would do at the start of the season. We expect, in total, that leaning in on marketing to be a little less impactful on the P&L than we did for the full year and been on our merchandising to be a little more, but we will still have both of them turn up pretty high in the third quarter. Again, I missed the first part of the question. I think Glenn, did as well. I apologize. Yes. Thank you. I got the question, merchandising. Obviously, it's something that we use selectively. We will think about further disclosure as it grows. Obviously, this year is something that we will \u2013 but think of it as something we are leaning into this year in a recovering marketplace, just like marketing. As and when things have recovered, we may not have to lead in quite heavily. So, we kind of see this may also fluctuate. We have not broken it out. Yes, it does obviously have a bit of an impact upon take rates. And probably the way to give you some flavor on it in the future is to give you a bit more flavor as to how it's impacting take rate, but nothing more to disclose at this point in time. And just final, as we build out the elements of the connected trip, that gives us more ways to merchandise. At the moment, a lot of our merchandises through pricing type activity, but as Glenn mentioned, we are looking at providing incentives or other benefits to our high-value accommodation customers, if they are buying more elements of the total trip. So, the mix of how we merchandise on our side will also change over time as well. Yes. Thanks, Glenn. Brian, yes, on international travel, Q2 is probably the best place to come look because we have got the full quarter numbers to talk about. International, that was the first quarter that we saw growth in international travel in total vis-a\u0300-vis 2019. So, in Q2, international travel in total was a mid-single digit growth. Of course, the room nights in aggregate were up 16 points. Obviously, domestic was still strong, very strong, but it was the first quarter we saw return to growth of international travel in aggregate. And to your point, within international travel, we saw better-than-average growth in the \u2013 within regional travel, so travel within Europe and Asia, etcetera. And the long-haul international travel was still down mid-single digits, but was \u2013 still was almost recovered back to 2019 levels. So, I think it's an encouraging trends as we move through the quarter. As I mentioned, in terms of the overall improvement from Q1 to Q2, international travel drove most of that improvement. And Doug, on payments, I think that is not a new story. The fact that we are going to have some revenue streams that are going to be growing faster than the current average because they are newer and they will be less profitable from a profit margin point of view. We talked about payments of flights earlier during the year that are both going to be significant contributors to the business in the future will result in incremental EBITDA dollars \u2013 incremental EBITDA dollar growth, but will be dilutive to margin rates. And I don't think that's anything new. And I think that's a good thing for the business. It means we will have faster EPS growth for having those businesses than we would without. So, I think it's a conversation we had a few times in the early part of the year and hopefully nothing new. We are making progress and getting payments into the position we talked we thought we might be able to go into 2023. So, I view that as encouraging. Sorry. Fine. It's only a few points of incremental growth in the U.S. Yes. On my side, obviously, the base element in our fixed cost is personnel. And in recent years, with the current inflation rates and obviously wage inflation, that has been pressured particularly for tech and technology people and product people, the marketing folks, etcetera, engineers. So, that's been under pressure for a little while. We believe that when we get back to this post-COVID steady state and we get to the situation where we are gaining share, growing top line faster than we used to grow in the bottom line faster than we used to, we believe that we can start looking at the right time of getting leverage from our fixed costs. But at the moment, we are obviously facing some short-term pressures."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to announce that we reached another milestone in our company's recovery with room nights for Q2 being the first quarter in which we have surpassed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Our customers booked 246 million room nights in the second quarter, so just shy of 0.25 billion room nights, which represented an increase of 16% versus Q2 2019 and a significant improvement from the 9% decline in Q1. We continue to see very strong accommodation ADR growth, which helped drive an even higher 38% increase in gross bookings in the second quarter or 48% growth on a constant currency basis. Both our room nights and gross bookings in Q2 were our company's highest quarterly amounts ever for these metrics. While we continue to see bookings growth in July versus 2019, the pace of growth moderated to about 4% for room nights and just over 20% for gross bookings or about 35% growth on a constant currency basis with room night and gross bookings growth slightly improving in the back half of the month versus the comparable weeks in 2019. For the remainder of the summer period through the end of Q3, we see higher gross bookings on the books than at this point in 2019, which we believe will result in a record revenue for the third quarter, which is our seasonally largest revenue quarter. Looking towards the rest of the year, Booking.com, we see solid gross bookings for the fourth quarter, which are about 15% higher than at this same point in 2019 on a euro basis. Though I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable and current FX rates will negatively impact that growth rate in dollars by about 10 percentage points. The booking window remains shorter than it was at this point in 2019, which somewhat limits our visibility into how Q4 will continue to develop. And although conditions could change rapidly, we are cautiously optimistic on the data we are seeing so far. David will provide further details on the recent trends we have been seeing. Now, we recognize that there is uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and questions about the strength of consumer demand through the end of this year and into next year. And while it is extremely difficult to accurately predict the near-term economic environment, I am as confident as ever in consumers' strong desire to travel, the attractive long-term growth profile of the travel industry and our improving longer term competitive position. With our industry leading margins, high-quality earnings, strong free cash flow and liquidity position and solid balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate any potential near-term economic uncertainty and continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform, while making progress on our key strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. In terms of attracting customers to our platform, our unique active customers at Booking.com surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter, driven by very strong growth in returning customers who have not made a previous booking over a year as well as growth in repeat customers. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest second quarter level ever. We aim to build on increasing our direct mix through several initiatives, including by continuing to enhance the benefits of our Genius loyalty program, further building out our connected trip vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app. In our mobile app, we see the strongest direct repeat customer behavior when compared to our other platforms like desktop or mobile web. Consistent with the first quarter, over 40% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the second quarter which is about 10 percentage points higher than in 2019. Booking.com's app continue to set new records in terms of monthly active users in Q2 and remains the number one downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. As I said before, the app is a critical platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all the combination types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. Alternative accommodation in room nights, Booking.com grew about 25% versus 2019 and representing about a third of Booking.com's total room nights in Q2. We continue improving our alternative accommodation product globally with an additional focus on the U.S. market. In the first quarter, we launched partner liability insurance for our alternative accommodation supply partners with global coverage. In the second quarter, we launched enhanced payment solution for professional property managers in the U.S. and have made progress increasing adoption by our partners. Finally, we started rolling out the damage policy option for partners in the second quarter and have continued expanding this option to more countries in the third quarter. Each of these initiatives helps add important features to our alternative accommodation offering, which we believe strengthens our efforts to attract more properties and partners onto our platform. In the second quarter, we saw the largest sequential net increase in alternative accommodation properties since 2019 and we now have 6.6 million alternative accommodation listings on Booking.com. We are encouraged by the increase in alternative accommodation supply that we have seen so far this year and we aim to further build on this growth as we move through the second half of the year. Let me now talk about the progress we have made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. Of this, 38% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the second quarter, which is our highest quarterly level ever. We continue to increase adoption of payments by our property partners, with over 60% of our total Q2 gross bookings coming from properties that have adopted payments. So, this means that about two-thirds of the bookings at payment-enabled properties are being processed via payments. We believe Booking.com's payment services drive benefits for both our travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions. Furthermore, we believe that Booking.com's payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger connected trip vision. On the connected trip, I think it's a helpful reminder to talk to what we are hoping to achieve with this vision. Our vision for the connected trip strives to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable while delivering better value to our customers and a way to provide marketing opportunities to our supplier partners. And as a result, we believe over time we will drive increase in customer engagement, share spend and loyalty. First, we are looking to increase the engagement of customers on our platform by solving more of our customers' travel problems than just finding the right accommodation of Booking.com as we have done in the past. A simple example of solving a problem and driving additional engagement would be proactively suggesting options for top attractions that can be booked seamlessly in our app while our travelers a destination and looking for something to do. Another example is our testing discounted transportation from the airport to the hotel for say a high-value accommodation customer. And the ground transportation supplier might in the future be providing a discounted price that is specific for our customer, because we are able to provide incremental business. Second, we see the opportunity to increase our share of customers' travel spend. We estimate that pre-pandemic, our customers' annual spend on Booking.com represented only about 25% of their total travel spend on average. We believe that by making it easier to book multiple elements of the trip in one place, we can take more part of that travel spend onto our platform. Even in core accommodations and even with top customers, we believe there are opportunities to improve our share of spend over time. And we want to increase customer loyalty and drive a higher direct mix through our app over time. We believe by addressing our customers' critical needs of value, choice and convenience through our connected trip vision we will deliver an improved experience and increase the likelihood that our customers come back to us again on a direct basis. This year, we continue to make progress as we work on building the foundation of the connected trip, including developing a flight offering of Booking.com. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process and allows us an opportunity to suggest other services to these flight bookers. Flights continues to be a source for new customers with about one quarter or 4 of our flight bookers globally being new to Booking.com with an even higher share of new customers in the U.S. In conclusion, I am encouraged by our strong second quarter results and the record level of summer travel we are seeing now. Our teams are working hard to continue making progress in several key areas, including the app, the Genius program, our alternative accommodation offering, payments at Booking.com and building towards our connected trip vision. Through this work, we believe we are building a better offering for our customers and partners while strengthening our long-term competitive position. While there is uncertainty around the near-term macroeconomic environment, we are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. Thank you, Mark. And question actually has some interrelated themes. So let's start a little bit with, I'm going to repeat how happy I am. When we spoke last time, and I talked about April being the first month that we were able to say were recovered beyond 2019. And now we have a full quarter where we've done very, very well. As you point out, very strong there. And yes, we see that there is been some moderation, but I will repeat, July gross bookings, 35% on a constant currency basis. That's pretty strong. And yet we know that the recovery is not fully done yet. We know there are countries around the world that are still somewhat inhibiting travel, making it more difficult. And we know we hear about people saying how hard it's been in some airports. We read about some of the travelers with cancellations and the crowds and you have to come 5 hours before on the airport, all these things. So, why the deceleration? Hard to say and we can all hypothesize about what that is and why and all that. But I do believe there is tremendous opportunity still in this recovery. And then going into your first question about what share we can get, that is something that we will get even more of because I believe in our future, the idea is that we know travel is going to continue to increase in the long run. We don't know how steady it will be. We know the volatility we see the last 2 years. This recovery is not a linear straight line up. They are ups and downs, up and downs. And now we have some economic things people are talking about and certainly what the mill pandemic. There is a war, as David pointed out, what things would have been without Russia, Belarus. Look, there is a lot of uncertainty in the short run that's understood, but the long run is fairly certain that travel will continue to increase. Our job is to continue to improve our products and our services so we get that higher share of our current customers get more customers and get a lot of their share to. How do we do that? All the things I talked about. I talk about building out that connected trip. I talk about making the app better. We talk about payments. We talk all things we're doing. And we're seeing us gain think that share and we see it has improved. Now what is the ultimate \u2013 what we talk 25 should that go? Somebody individual look, this is the average. Some customers, I'm certain, were getting a huge amount of it, some customers less so. And it certainly depends on what kind of product our customers are looking for. And we've mentioned in the past that we know in some parts of the world, our alternative accommodations, is not where I want to be yet. We're working on that to make that better. So sometimes uncertain customers say, I'm going to use Booking.com this type of stay, and I'm going to use some competitor for this other type of stay. That's an area we can do better and get more share. So I'm not going to come back and say, my goal is x percentage but will come back and say, I absolutely we're on the right path, and we are growing that share, and we're going to continue to do that in the long run. David, anything you want to add to that? Yes. So actually, your last question actually applies to the earlier part, which is part of our decision how we spend our money, whether it be dollars, euro again, whatever, how do we spend it? To point people to our platform and get them to buy something is factored by what do we think we're going to get in terms of the return. And when they return is, are they going to come back? Or else they going to come back? Are they coming back direct or not? Do they now make want to pay from the cannot? All of these types of things go into our calculations around our machine learning, all the science we bring in to try and decide what is the best use of the money? And we're looking, obviously, the markets are dynamic. I haven't used that word in a while, but we're going to use it today right now. These markets are dynamic. And whether it's a performance marketing market you're looking at or any other type of market in terms of what is the best way to put that money to work to get the best long-term value for our company. And that's what we're doing right now. And clearly, David pointed out that we're leaning more toward some merchandising right now because we believe that is the appropriate use of our money right now to get the best return in the long run for the company. And obviously, one factor is getting to come back again and again, and that's the important point in trying to make sure that we use the money correctly. Well, I'm going to say that we believe the repeat rates are appropriate for the money we're spending, and we're comfortable with how we're spending it. How about that? Did you guys \u2013 he kind of broke up. I would say one thing in turn generally in merchandise. But in general, when we talk about one of the values in the connected trip, and I mentioned in my prepared remarks about providing a marketing platform for suppliers to be able to do what they feel is appropriate in terms of maximizing their value and us providing them an opportunity to do their own way to merchandise and offer up different types of offers to our customers. And we will use all sorts of important scientific analysis of where it's really incremental for them. And that I believe is something that's going to be very helpful going and run, particularly if we are in a less of a hot market where everybody feels we can sell at maximum price. When things start getting a little more interesting, that will be another opportunity for us to provide value to our supplier partners. Sure. So, let me take the first one, and David can do the second one. I know he talked a little bit in what sort of details you want to give on that second one. On the first one, I will make the point that several years ago, I said that it was just hard for us to do better in the U.S. That would be a strategic priority for us to get more share we are under-indexed in the U.S. We felt we have a very good product, but now improve upon it. And that is something that we should be doing better we would. And now we are beginning to see some of that. We are seeing these kind of growth rates that you just mentioned, and that is something that I am very happy that the team has executed well. Now what is the silver bullet, there is no silver bullet. It's a lot of things. There is a tremendous number of different things being worked out by so many different teams. And I can \u2013 we can spend all through the rest of this call talking about all the things that have been done by the different people to improve so we can get higher share. And you have seen some of it yourself. You see our brand marketing. You see the things that we are doing in terms of app. You see us in terms of being payments out. We have Booking.com and have payments in the space, and we have that. And assuming those things is the blocking and tackling every day, working with the suppliers, achieving better relationships so that we work together so we can offer up to travelers something that really fits what their needs are. And I can't come out and help you in terms of \u2013 this is the biggest part, the next part and the next part. What I can say is that this is something that has been something that's been important to us, but I am glad to see the results starting to come through. It's not done by any way, shape or form. There is a lot more to be done, and I continue to repeat myself about we got to do better in the alternative accommodations in the states. Not enough people know about it, and we have enough supply and all those areas we want to improve upon there. And obviously, flights started up for Booking.com in the States and is doing well, but a lot more to do there. And all those things that connected trips. So, lots more to be done there, but that is an area where we are going to continue. As I said, it's one of our priorities, one of the things we are working hard on it. And I am happy to see to be able to show people, here is what the growth \u2013 the progress that we have made so far. So, a couple of thoughts about ADR. Obviously, we talked about ADR, a very global average-type thing. But it's interesting, when you look around the world, it's not the same everywhere. In Asia, very different than what's happened in States, let's say, differences in Europe, too. It is interesting that in almost all the time I have been in the travel industry, when you had lower occupancy rates, that would usually end up with lower ADRs. People try to fill up those last rooms because the margin that would drop to the bottom line was huge. Yet, that is not what's happening here. You see occupancy rates, for example, in the States, still not at historical highs, yet we all know ADRs certainly are. And that's an interesting change from how they have been in the past. And now your question is a good one. Well, what's going to happen in the future? Are these things going to come back \u2013 are these ADRs going to come back down now at some point, if demand does drop, are we going to see that come back down, or are the hoteliers going to continue what they have been doing with us saying, look, I can't even service for all of my rooms. So, I am not going to try and fill them. But I don't want to know on labor or labor cost. It's better or doing better by doing this higher ADRs and not trying to fill everything. That's happening in some of the places. The truth is, nobody knows what's going to happen in the future. I do know, though, that we have flexibility ourselves, that we work well when there is \u2013 ADRs are high, as you have seen with the numbers we just printed, which is great. And also when ADRs are dropping because the suppliers need more demand, we are there to help them. We did better than most of the people in the industry coming straight out of the depth of the pandemic because we worked really hard with these suppliers to find a way to get the demand, and we did that. And that's really our role with them is to make sure we are putting heads and beds for them at the price that they think is right. And that's what we are going to continue to do. So, I can't tell you what's going to happen in the future. I can tell you, we will continue to execute well under either scenario. So, I can answer the second one first because I heard that one well, and I want to go back and get that first question again. Again, we are very pleased with how it's working, very nice, but that is not a big driver at all in these numbers. So \u2013 and I will let David work sort of specificity, but I would say do not \u2013 that is not the \u2013 it's nice. It's good. I am very happy how we are doing. I am pleased. I love the guys, doing great. It is very helpful in our B2B strategic partnership area. Helping us build out that part of our business to be a very competitive part of the business with others too, it's one element. We had that part of the business for a long time before. This is just one addition to our overall B2B area. So, that's something I am there. I will let \u2013 David, do you want to say on that and get...? Yes. So, if we can, can you say the first question because I think I heard flight cancellations. I am not sure what you said. Could you go back to? Oh, I have got it now. Okay. So, it goes back to me trying to explain and talk about the non-linearity of the heats [ph] in January because yes, we see the change, and I talked at the beginning about that. And one hypothesis, certainly, somebody in the past, people have definitely talked about, well, when it's hot, people don't travel as much. That's true. There is definitely there that in there. And there certainly is the cancellation of the Air Force Macassar, and that probably played a factor too. There are a lot of things that are probably played \u2013 and we want to look at how strong May was. And did that take some bookings from July we ended up in May because people were just \u2013 as soon as the pandemic levels went down, and so I am calling it down. People say I am going right away and won they would have waited. There is so many potential hypothesis. I can't tease them all out. And in fact, I would say it's actually not that \u2013 it's not that important because we are talking for the long run, one month versus another month. In my mind, yes, I know there was going to be volatility in these things, variability. But we are looking at the long run. Are we achieving what we want to continue to open the long run, build this business? And we are doing that. And I see that. So I can't really help you on whatever guess is you would like yourself, but what's more important in my mind is are we executing, creating a better product, a better service that we will get more share as the travel recovery continues, which it is. And again, I emphasize this recovery from the pandemic is nowhere near done yet. When you look at countries like, in Japan, there are a lot of places where it's not where everybody isn't just traveling as they used to at all. In Asia, we mentioned Asia. It's not a full recovery yet. Look at China, lots of places where the pandemic has not totally disappeared. Everybody is living like they did in 2019 at all, but there is a lot of room to come back just from recovery, and we are looking forward to that. Well, I think we talked a little bit about what share of our business in the alternative accommodations now and how we saw a couple of percentage points better than 2019 to more accommodations versus hotels. That's steady improvement that we are pleased we are seeing. We talked a little bit about the U.S. and the mix there. It's still low in terms of the share that's going to internal accommodations, but we are pleased with the mix is improving. It's on the right path. I am not sure in terms of general, though I think I know your question is, is this going to be \u2013 are people going back to where they formerly had done a lot more hotels and are they going to switch back there? I don't think anybody knows or not. But what I emphasize is how important it is to offer both. And that's why we think we have an advantage because we know, and I mentioned this in previous calls, we know people come to our site thinking they want one type of accommodation, yet we see by the way they search and the way they look at different potential places to stay, that there is actually a lot of uncertainty. And by offering both a hotel and a home or apartment or avail, whatever it is, we are providing better information to the travelers to be able to make the right choice and have a higher opportunity that they will buy from us because we are offering these different types of services. So, I don't know what's going to happen in terms of people's behavior going back. I can guess. I think that people who have enjoyed a home they never get before, they are going to continue to look at that home. And I am fine with that because we offer it. So, it's okay by me if that's what's happening. What I would like to do, of course, is make our home products be top brand \u2013 be as good as anybody else's and make sure that nobody ever says, I gave you all of that, here are some things you don't have yet. That's something I want to get rid of. Well, I will take the first one. I will let David do the second one. And what we have said, and it hasn't changed, what we said in the past is that we are a meaningful percentage of bookers who first book a flight then book an accommodation. And we are saying for new customers, we see that an encouraging percentage of them are attaching an accommodation to the flight booking, which is what I said in the past and I will say the same because it's pretty much the same. And David, on your side? Well, thank you. So, after the difficult situation in the last 2.5 years, we are very pleased to arrive at where we are today. And I want to thank our partners, our customers, dedicated employees and our shareholders. We greatly appreciate the support as we continue to build on our long-term vision for our company. Thank you everyone and good night."

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings\u2019 first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to begin by reporting that our first quarter was a record. Our customers booked $27 billion in gross bookings, the highest quarterly amount ever. The continued improvement in our room night trends, increased accommodation ADRs and significant growth in our global flights product all contributed to achieving this gross bookings record. In our accommodations business, we saw meaningful improvement from last year, with first quarter room nights declining only 9% versus Q1 2019 which was an improvement of 12 percentage points from our fourth quarter 2021 results. Our bookings continued to strengthen in April, with roommates increasing 10% and gross bookings up over 30% versus 2019, making April a record month for gross bookings and our first month that global room nights exceeded 2019 levels. @Booking.com, I'm encouraged by the strong gross bookings already recorded for the summer period, which are over 15% higher than at this same point in 2019. In Western Europe and North America, gross bookings for the summer period are now over 30% ahead of where we were at this point in 2019. Though, I know that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable. Of course, our brands or other brands, we are seeing the benefits of a global recovery from the pandemic with strong travel demand in the US for Priceline, a rapid recent improvement and trends in Asia for Agoda and uptick in international flight searches at KAYAK and the return of diners to restaurants for OpenTable. In many countries, especially across Europe and Asia, travel restrictions were eased in the first quarter, which we believe has contributed to the strengthening of travel demand trends. As we have said before, with leisure travelers believe it is safe to travel and restrictions are lifted, people booked travel. With that being said, there are still restrictions and inconveniences imposed on travelers today by some countries, though we believe that the industry is moving in the right direction and progressing back to normalcy. While we are pleased with the trends we're seeing right now across our brands, as we look towards the rest of the year, we are cognizant of the potential for macro uncertainty, and are aware that inflation or other macro factors may have an impact on consumer demand. And before providing further updates on our business, I want to address the devastating war in Ukraine. Since first hearing the terrible news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, our first priority was the safety of our colleagues and supporting them through this time. We worked closely with our employees and their families in Ukraine to provide them with safe refuge, and we have continued to support humanitarian efforts in the region. As we previously disclosed in early March, we suspended travel services in Russia and Belarus. By mid-March Booking.com Booking.com, developed and launched a no commission initiative that enabled properties in select European countries to offer free or heavily discounted accommodations to refugees fleeing Ukraine. We believe that about 30,000 refugees have been provided with places to stay through this initiative so far. We continue to work closely with our hotel and home partners, and expect to expand this program to more properties in the region. As an example, Booking.com has partnered with Hilton and the UN Refugee Agency to make it easy for NGOs to book temporary accommodations on behalf of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine. These rooms have been made available for free by Hilton at hundreds of their properties across Europe, which we in turn are providing through our platform. I am very proud of our team's quick actions to help our employees, customers, partners and the many people impacted by these tragic events. And, of course, we all hope this barbaric violence end soon. Let's now turn to the progress we're making in our business. We continue our work strengthening our core accommodation business by driving benefits to our traveler customers and to our supply partners. For our customers, we are focused on their critical needs of value, choice and convenience. With this high degree of customer focus, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend, and direct relationships with our customers over time. In March, our unique active Booking.com customers at Booking.com were within 95% of 2019 levels, driven by strong growth in returning customers who had not made a previous booking in over a year. In the first quarter, we saw a higher mix of customers booking directly with us than any of the last three quarters first quarters, three years first quarters. We see the strongest direct repeat customer behavior in our mobile app than when compared to other platforms like desktop or mobile web. We continue to see more of our business shift to the app with over 40% of our room nights booked through our apps in the first quarter. Booking.com\u2019s app hit a new record in terms of monthly active users in Q1 and continue to be the number one downloaded OTA app globally, according to a third-party research firm. As I said before, the app is a critical platform, as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. And ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app to build on the recent success we have seen here. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform, which primarily means bringing incremental demand to properties from the broad audience of potential customers on our platform. For alternative accommodations, our global mix of room nights in the first quarter increased to about 31%, a couple of points higher than in Q1 2021. We continue to work on improving our alternative accommodation product globally with an additional focus on the US market. We've been working closely with property partners to identify opportunities to improve our platform to better fit their needs. Related to these efforts, we launched partner liability insurance for our alternative accommodation supply partners with global coverage in the first quarter. In addition, we are making progress on an enhanced payment solution for professional property managers that we're rolling out in the US. In the first quarter, we saw the largest sequential net increase in alternative accommodation properties on Booking.com since the start of the pandemic. While the net increase in Q1 was still a modest number of properties, we\u2019re aiming to build on this growth throughout 2022 by continuing to improve our alternative accommodation offering and attracting more partners to our platform. In this week, we launched a new campaign in the US to promote Booking.com to alternative accommodation owners and managers who want to grow their business with us. Let me now talk about the progress we've made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trend. We believe both of these priorities will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth. On payments, 34% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the first quarter, which is our highest quarterly level ever. This year, we are focused on continuing to increase supplier adoption of payments, while introducing new products and features that over time will improve the customer and partner experience and bring new revenue streams to our platform. We will continue to position Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment service for both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, Booking.com\u2019s payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger Connected Trip Vision. On our Connected Trip Vision, we continue to make progress as we work on the foundations such as developing a flight offering on Booking.com, which is now live in 40 countries. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process, and allows us an opportunity to core sell our accommodation and other services to these flight bookers. We have seen that in over 70% of our flight bookings on Booking.com, the flight was the first or only product that was booked. This helps confirm the value of flights as the starting point in many people's booking journey, and is an anchor part that we can utilize to cross-sell accommodations and other products, a meaningful percentage of bookers who first book a flight, then book an accommodation. We'll continue our work to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity, and build on the early positive signals that we're seeing so far. Flights continues to be a source for new customers, with about one quarter of all flight bookers in Q1 being new customers for Booking.com. We've also seen recent success driving incremental room nights and experiments where discounts are applied to non-accommodation products that were attached to the transaction. To put it simply, we believe having more products on the shelf, increases our merchandising opportunities, and helps us sell more room nights. Finally, as I previewed on our last earnings call, we published our 2021 sustainability report and our Climate Action Plan in March. In our Climate Action Plan, we highlighted the significant emission reductions we've already achieved, in part driven by sourcing 100% renewable energy for our office by the end of last year. And we are committed to more than halving our emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2040. We are proud of the emissions reduction achieved and ambitious target set for our business. But as I said before, we believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through making it easier for travelers to find and book sustainable options. We are addressing this opportunity through our work with our Travel Still Badging program, which now includes over 100,000 properties that can highlight their sustainable practices to customers on Booking.com. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strength we are seeing in bookings, the level of summer travel on our books and the potential for a very busy travel year ahead. As we discussed last quarter, in this recovery environment, we will continue to lean into performance marketing channels and appropriate ROIs as we look to bring more customer demand to our platform. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue capturing this returning travel demand. And we will continue our work executing against our strategic priorities. As I said before, we are focusing on building a larger and faster growing business with more products that is sustainable, and generates more earnings dollars for the long run. Now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\nDavid Goulden : Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the first quarter and provide some color on trends we've seen so far in the second quarter. All growth rates for \u201822 relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the first quarter. On our February earnings call we discussed the improved in trends we've seen so far in 2022. With room nights getting back to about flat versus 2019 in the first half of February after declining 21% in January just hours after our earnings call on February 23, the terrible news broke the Russia invaded Ukraine. As a result, we saw an immediate negative impact on room night trends, particularly in Eastern Europe. Despite this impact towards end of the month, room nights for the full month of February came in about in line with 2019 levels. In early March, we suspended the booking of travel services in Russia and Belarus. This led to a loss of new bookings, as well as significantly elevated levels of cancellations of reservations for these countries. Additionally, we saw some slowdown in booking trends within Europe, as travelers took in the news of the invasion. We disclosed that total room nights for the week ending March 6, were down about 10%. And that slowdown was driven by Eastern Europe, primarily Russia, and to a lesser extent by Western Europe, which remained mostly above 2019 levels. I'm pleased to say that compared with the first week in March, we saw our overall trend improve during March driven mainly by Europe, resulting in room nights been down about 4% for the month, which is only a modest pullback from where we were in February. For the first quarter, room nights were down 9%, an improvement from down 21% in Q4. And our best quarter results since the onset of the pandemic. Excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, our room nights were down about 2% in March and down about 6% for the first full quarter. But Q1 on a regional level room nights in Europe and the rest of the world were both down mid-single digits. Asia was down about 35% with all three improving from Q4 levels. The US has strong growth versus Q1 2019 similar to what we saw in Q4. Mobile bookings primarily through our apps represented about 6% of our total room nights in the first quarter. Our apps were over two thirds of our mobile bookings and over 40% of total room nights. In the first quarter, we continue to see an increase mix of our total room nights coming through as the direct channel versus Q1 2019 and Q1 2022. The International mix of our total room nights in Q1 was about 40%, an encouraged increased from about 33% in Q4. Q1 International room nights were down about 30% compared to Q1 2019 levels, an improvement from the almost 40% -- for the almost 50% decline in Q4. The improvements in international bookings we saw continue to be driven mainly by travel plans within Europe. And these cross border bookings continue to have on average, longer length of stay and a shorter booking window and comparable bookings in 2019. We saw strong growth in our domestic room nights for the first quarter also an improvement from Q4. Our cancellation rates were about in line with 2019 levels in Q1 despite the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The booking window in Q1 of Booking.com contrasted less versus 2019 than it did in Q4. And this booking window expanded versus the first quarter of 2021. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, the global mix of room nights increased to about 31% in Q1, a couple points higher than 2021. Within Europe, our mixed alternative accommodation continuously, meaningfully higher than the global average. Gross bookings increased to 7% in Q1 versus 2019 and were up 10%, excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. This 7% increase in gross bookings were 16 percentage points better than 9% room night due to 18% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to strong flight bookings across the group, partially offset by about four percentage points of negative FX movements. As Glenn mentioned in his remarks, the $27 billion of gross bookings in Q1 is a new record for us higher than the previous record at $25 billion in Q1 2019. On March 2022 was the first month our gross bookings exceeded $10 billion in a single month. This was up 17% versus March 2019 and compared to up 18% in February and down 11% in January. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about three percentage points from regional mix and about 15 percentage points from rate increases in most of our regions. Notably, most notably Europe and North America, and especially in higher demand leisure oriented destinations. Constant currency ADR growth versus 2019, accelerated from 13% in Q4 to 18% in Q1, primarily due to higher rates in New York. Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up 152% versus 2019 and up 69% versus 2021, driven by continued expansion of Booking.com site platform, as well as continued flight ticket growth at Priceline. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $2.7 billion, which was down 7% versus 2019 and down about 2% on a constant currency basis, revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 150 basis points below Q1 2019 in line with our expectations, due primarily to differences between gross bookings, the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q1 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line decreased to 4% versus Q1 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings decreased about 50 basis points versus Q1 2019, which is better than our expectations, mainly due to unexpected marketing ROIs. Sales and other expenses were up 58% versus Q1 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher third party call center costs. About 34% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q1, up from 13% in Q1 2019 compared to Q1 2021, sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were about 30 basis points higher. Our more fixed expenses in aggregates were about in line with our expectations, up 12% versus Q4 and up 17% versus Q1 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $310 million for the quarter, which was better than our expectations due to unexpected ADRs. And the better than expected leverage of our variable expenses. However, sequentially EBITDA was down 67%, which is significantly more than the seasonal decline you saw pre-COVID and aligns with our commentary in February. Non-GAAP net income of $161 million results in non-GAAP EPS of $3.90 which was down 65% versus Q1 2019. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 16% was lower than 19% in Q1 2019 due to a great impact from a discrete tax benefit on a lower base earnings. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $174 million in Q1. We recorded GAAP net loss of $700 million in the quarter, which included an unrealized loss on our strategic investments of about $987 million and a $36 million loss on assets held for sale related to the Majorelle strategic partnership we discussed last quarter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of about $12.8 billion was down versus our Q4 ending balance of $14.3 billion, primarily driven by the payments of $1.1 billion for a margin debt maturity, about $950 million in share repurchases in Q1 and the declining value of our strategic investments. These factors which reduce our cash investment balance were partially offset by positive free cash flow of about $1.6 billion, which was driven almost entirely by change in working capital, resulting from an increase in our deferred merchant bookings balance. As we disclosed, on last quarter we started returning capital to shareholders in early January. And in addition to share purchases in Q1, we repurchased about $325 million of shares in April, which brings our outstanding authorization to just over $9 million. As we said before, we expect to complete our remaining authorization within the next three years. Now moving on to our thoughts for the second quarter, April room nights increased about 10% versus 2019, an improvement from the 4% decline in March, driven primarily by Europe, excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, April room nights increased about 16% versus 2019. All regions show improving room nights growth in April. Europe was up high teens percent in April and up about 30% excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth in the US was very strong, rest of world had doubled digit growth, and Asia recovers to down high teens percent all versus 2019. The international mix of our room nights in April was over 45% and encouraging increase from the 40% in Q1. April international room nights were down slightly compared to 2019 levels, an improvement from down 30% in Q1. International demand driven mainly by travel plans in Europe accounted for most of the improvements in room nights in April versus Q1. Domestic room nights also improved in April to very strong growth versus 2019. April gross bookings increased over 30% versus 2019, driven by growth in room nights continued accommodation ADR strength, as well as continued strength in flight bookings. April gross bookings increased to almost $11 billion, which was a new monthly record. April gross bookings typically declined from March pre-COVID. While it's encouraging to see continued improvements in trends into April, the environment is still uncertain and difficult to predict with confidence how room nights for the remainder of the quarter will develop. While many countries are lifting their list of travel restrictions, COVID is still a factor which can impact travel and of course, the war in Ukraine continues to create volatility and macro uncertainty. We do expect the recent strength in ADRs to continue for the remainder of the quarter. And as a result, we expect the difference between the level of room nights growth and gross bookings growth for the full second quarter to be around 20 points, which is similar to what it was in April. In April, the overall booking window Booking.com continue to move back closer to 2019 levels. We continue to see strength in our summer booking trends, and our gross bookings for summer are now more than 15% higher than they were at this time in 2019. And within Western Europe and North America both of over 30% albeit with a higher mix of cancelable bookings. If the current trends continue, we could see a record summer travel season and we're gearing up to prepare for that across all parts of our business. Turning back to Q2, given recent booking trends combined with lengthening booking window, we expect Q2 revenue as percentage of gross bookings to be about 200 basis points lower than it was in Q2 2019. This 200 basis points of difference in revenue as a percentage of gross bookings is mainly timing related, and the impact could be greater if booking trends accelerate from April, especially if a high percentage of these bookings were staged in future quarters. The timing impact on take rates in Q2 is driven by a combination of the acceleration in gross bookings from up 7% in Q1 to up over 30% so far in Q2 coupled with the lengthening booking window from Q1 to Q2, we expect our underlying accommodation take rates to remain stable. We expect marketing expense percentage of gross bookings to be slightly higher than in Q2 2019, which is consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunities for us to lean into recovering travel market in 2022. We expect Q2 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 60 basis points higher than it was in Q2, 2021 due to higher virtual booking mix and higher third party call center costs. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate to be about 15% higher than in Q2 2021. With personnel down slightly on both G&A and IT up meaningfully versus Q2 last year. The overall year-on-year increase in G&A is driven by higher digital sales taxes, which is tied to revenue as well as increased office expenses due to return to hybrid work environments. We expect IT to increase year-over-year at similar rates to what we saw in Q1. If we were to see similar top line growth rates for the rest of the quarter we saw in April, we'd expect adjusted EBITDA to be over $900 million for the quarter. The expected timing difference between gross bookings and revenue which is the primary driver are expected 200 basis points lower take rate than Q1 2019 will have a significant negative impact on EBITDA in Q2 as our more variable expense lines are linked to bookings. If we normalize the timing impact on our take rates in Q2 2022 to be the same as it was in Q2 2019, adjusted EBITDA in Q2 2022 will be slightly higher than it was in Q2 2019. Now turning to the enhanced strategic partnership with Majorelle we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, Majorelle one of our most trusted long term external customer support partners will begin employing most of the customer service representatives and previous work for Booking.com outside of the Netherlands and the UK. We currently anticipate finalizing sponsorship around the middle of the year. And following the anticipated closing on a quarterly basis in the second half of 2022, we expect the personnel expenses will be lowered by about $25 million a quarter, but G&A expenses will be lower by $6 million a quarter. And our external expenses will increase to offset the lower personnel and G&A expenses. As we said last quarter, we did not anticipate much of an impact on adjusted EBITDA in 2022 from this initiative beyond 2022. We believe this partnership will help reduce further expense growth and enable a more efficient ramp up of our customer service function. Outside of the P&L geography changes to the personnel G&A and sales and other expense line from Majorelle, we are maintaining the full year P&L commentary we provided last quarter. As a reminder, the expected timing, we expect timing to know the impact take rates. The precise impact timing on our take rates for the year is difficult to predict as it is impacted by the rate of recovery of bookings coming into and during the year. And also by the length of booking windows during the year. We do know the relative to 2021 there was a negative impact on our take rates due to timing in Q1 2022. Our current best estimates of take rates in 2022 is just below 15%, which is lower than 2019 primarily due to timing. We expect the underlying accommodation take rates will remain stable. Timing also negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins for the year. If not impacted timing our expectations for full year EBITDA margins will be a few points higher than our guidance for the year. We're encouraged by our better than expected Q1 results and the strengthening trends we've seen in April, and we are confident that our focus on customer acquisition and expanding our product offerings is the right approach for 2022. We\u2019ll now take the questions. Shawn, over to you, please for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Alright, thanks for taking the question, two, if I can, first, on the April trends in bookings in room nights, those sound nicely ahead of where street estimates are for the whole quarter. So is there any reason to think that you won't continue to build from April in terms of kind of thinking about monthly comps or anything else we should keep in mind, pull forward or pent-up demand. And then secondly, helpful color on the revenue take rates and the EBITDA impact from timing, I guess, how do we think about that as we work into next year. Should take rates at least kind of like for like accommodation normalized to 2019 levels next year? And does that EBITDA headwind of few points on timing does all of that unwind you think as we get into 2023, any help you can give us on the kind of margins and how they progress further would be great. Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Lloyd. While I\u2019ll take that first one, I'll let David go back over the timing issues that you just asked about. So your question really is trying to predict the future, which is always an interesting adventure, particularly over the last couple of years that we've all gone through. As I've said, David was saying, we're very pleased with where we are. And we're happy with what's happening. I think everybody around the world is happy about travel coming back. And we've mentioned how some of the trends that we're like -- that we like seeing in Asia where things are getting better, we know they're not as good as they are in Europe or in the US. That's a good positive sign. Hopefully that will continue. We're also pleased with the things that we've been saying that throughout Europe and Western Europe and Eastern Europe coming back that so we're all very happy where we are, but we never know. We never know what's going to happen. You know that we've done this. We had a call, our last call. And then there was a terrible, terrible news shortly thereafter, what happened in Ukraine and if you recall going back a quarter before that, COVIND omicron came out of nowhere. So we all know that the world is, let's say volatile right now. But I will say I am happy where we are. And I'm pleased with the incredible good job of execution our team has done. And, David, I'm not sure you want to add any more than that.\nDavid Goulden : Maybe, Glenn, just maybe a couple extra points on what we're seeing in April and March, we did see a steady progression from that first week in March where things were minus 10, up through March and April on a fairly steady basis, week on week. But as Glenn said, there's still a lot out there and the environment it\u2019s hard to predict. I would call it this Easter happened in April in both periods. So there's no Easter effect there relative to the growth rates versus 2019 August 2021 for that matter, either. Relative to longer term take rates. And I explained on the call, take rates are the impact timing on take rates is a mathematical impact of the difference between the amounts that you spill into the year from the prior year, and the amount you still out in the current year into the next year. And of course, that can be variable based upon effects. We saw this year, we said that there was a hurting Q1 on timing effects on take rates, because that's when Omicron basically came up with into Q4, and that results in less booking still into Q1 than we would expect. So it's really going to be a function of how the recovery develops in total in terms of how rapidly things recover, and also just the timing of that recovery. So as growth rate starts to normalize, and get back to more normal level, you expect the impact upon the take rea, the timing impact on take rates to come down. But then there could be some additional factors that could impact those specific things relative to what happens about the prior Q4 going into Q1, and the next Q4 going into the future Q1. So normally, and as the growth rates start to normalize the roles of revenue growth rates and booking growth rates start to align more, there will be less effect. But there could still be unusual effects they have, like what we've seen before that could impact the specific timing of Q1 and Q4, and the relative difference between those quarters across the years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. I have two, first one, David, I think last quarter, you talked about some like shape of the year comments, you talked about marketing as a percentage of gross bookings be a little higher than was in \u201819, et cetera. And sales and other expenses and sort of thoughts about that as far as your bookings? Yes, I know there was a lot of pieces with ADRs, moving around and et cetera. But can you just sort of maybe tell us your latest thoughts about some of those metrics on marketing spend for the year and sales and other for the year, however, you want to kind of help us think about it a little bit. And then Glenn, good to hear about traction you're making on payments and flights, et cetera. I guess, talk to us about on the connected trip front, which of the initiatives you think is most likely to really have a meaningful impact on the P&L as soon as maybe 2023 from an incremental dollar perspective. Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: David, you want to do that first one?\nDavid Goulden : Yes, Brian, let me go first. So with the exception of the mechanical movements, I'll talk about how they impact things little bit, the mechanical moves relative to Majorelle, which are basically just P&L geography movements. We're not, I'm not changing what we said last time. We do expect some deleverage in marketing to gross bookings for the year. We said we expected in Q1 to be relatively flat, we were a little bit better that we were actually 50 points \u2013 50 bps leveraging in Q1 due to a higher ROI, but we did say we'd be leaning into the busy travel season more in Q2 and Q3. So we're still expecting to see some level of deleverage during the year and also increased spending on merchandising, sales and others, we still expect that to be about 50 bps for the year that\u2019s tied to payments, the mechanics of the Majorelle adjustment with moving those additional expenses into [Indiscernible] would be less than 10 bps although that are adjustments again as to TGV. So essentially, with the exception of the mechanical movements, what we talked about for the last, what we talked about quarter go for how we see the year shaping up, we still expect to see the shaping up the same way. And of course, I've given you some additional color on take rates we didn't provide last quarter so that gives you a little bit more color than we gave you on quarter because we now know what happened in Q1 so we can give you a bit more guidance around that.\nGlenn Fogel: And, Brian, talking about connected trip. So connected trip is a long term vision. And it's going to take some time before we get to where I believe we need to be in terms of a truly step functional change in the way people are currently, by exploring going through travel, I think we all know how difficult it is. And we all know that it should be better. So that's the goal down the road. In 2023, we're still going to be pretty early in this, I think I would think it's, we're still in the base level of just getting great verticals up and running, so that they by themselves are fantastic, good product for people to use. And then just the basic-cross selling things that we think is a first step to get towards that connected trip. And if you ask me one of the biggest things for 2023. Well, the things I just talked about right now flights right now, I really liked the fact again, the new customers coming in, and they're coming in, they're buying a meaningful number of buyer combinations. And we haven't optimized this yet. That's something important. Then on top of that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks about just beginning small experiments with other types of verticals, and how putting these things together can give a better experience to a customer. The great thing about these things is trying to build a belief that coming to us to Booking.com is the best way to go. So getting more repeat business and getting this do it on the app, so that we don't pay for that person to come and increase that loyalty. So there's a lot of ways trying to increase this flywheel. So people know the products better and coming to us. And as we continue to do that, get more information, be able to provide a better proposal to them a better offer to them that they can work more easily. And it continues to build on its own. It's going to take time, though. And in 2023, I don't think you're going to see huge numbers from all things I just talked about. But you will see incremental improvement.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman from Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman : Great, thanks a lot. I was hoping to just dig in a little bit more on the April trends. The improvements is nice there to plus 10% is obviously a big acceleration. Could you -- what exactly are you seeing there in terms of changes? And if we relate that back to your ad spend, you had some leverage versus GBB in Q1, but you're spending more in Q2, how much of that is a reaction to what you're seeing versus strategically pulling on a lever in the start of Q2? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: So let me tell you in general, and David, I'm not sure you want to talk in terms of any sort of numbers and levers or whatever. But yes, we are very pleased with what we're seeing. But I believe it's a combination of many things that we're working on is really is a game of execution in the small details, means you're working with partners and getting the right price, the right inventory. And then it's making sure we're showing it to the customer at the right time in the right way. And it means also doing things we're talking about with alternative accommodations, bring in a few, bringing in some incremental more supply there, making sure we're working to come up with ways that works better, so that the customers having a better experience and their payments are more smooth, et cetera. I can go through a lot of little things that we're working on. And each one builds on its own. It makes it a better experience. Now, yes, we have a brand effort in the US, as you hopefully remember back from our Super Bowl, we, I believe a very good ad and we're continuing this is not just a one and done. It's a campaign. And we tie that with some efforts in social and we're doing a lot of different things to try to increase our awareness getting that top of mind awareness in the US, for example, helping build that. But this is a global effort really, in terms of trying to build our business by doing all the little things that make it a better product, because in the long run, the better product is what's going to win. And David, I don\u2019t know, if you want to speak anything specific in terms of ROIs or levers right there and nature.\nDavid Goulden : I think, Glenn, let we go where you went, because this is just not one geography. We're seeing all geographies improve in April, which for us is very encouraging. So we mentioned that Europe is now April back into high teen growth versus 2019. That is really encouraging and really the first time we've been able to talk about growth over 2019 in Europe, this is for room nights, US back to very strong growth versus 2019, which we think is well ahead of the market. And Glenn mentioned some of the factors, the APAC recovering nicely, down, still down but down IT is not, again the best result we've seen since the start of pandemic, and the rest of world backup to double digits, so all nice improvements from Q1, all nice improves to March, so it's not just one reason we're seeing it across the world, which I think is a positive sign, I mentioned that we will be leaning a little bit more, expect to leaning in more in Q2 than in we did in Q1, relative to the amount of spending and the ROI. But as we said, that is really in response to the opportunity to capture demand. When we see demand, and we see traffic on this site, that's when we can start increasing our marketing spend. So we're really responding to the opportunity of recovering travel. And whereas we see travel for that's when we can lead in sort of leaning in, particularly in Q3 of last year, you saw us do that in prior quarters. So it's early during the quarter, but that's why we said we expect it to be at a small level of deleveraging this quarter in marketing, but the impact we're seeing and the change we're seeing from March to April is very positive.\nKevin Kopelman : Great and could you touch on currency with the 30% GBV figure for April? Is that reported or constant currency and the dollar has strengthened since the last call. So I wanted to ask about that.\nDavid Goulden : Yes, that's a reported number. And currency is an impact for what it is worth when we did our guidance, and we did our calculations here we had your [Indiscernible] come down a little bit doesn't make a huge amount of difference. But the numbers we gave you or reported unless we call some out specifically as constant currency, for example, we call our constant currency ADRs. For example, everything else is reporting.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great, thank you. I guess I'm just trying to think about market share. Can you give us any indication of how much share US nights were back in \u201819? And what that looks like now? And then one question on take rates, I know your merchant, sorry, your payments platform is handling 34% versus 13%. I would think that would be increasing your overall take rates. But you said take rates about flat. So just talk, maybe you can help us understand how the merchant business is affecting take rates? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Dave, why don\u2019t you take that? And I\u2019ll just turn my [indiscernible]\u2026\nDavid Goulden : Yes, I talked about, so when we talk about the underlying take rates, we're talking about the basic take rate on the -- or the commission on the room. We're not factoring in payments to that at all, or motion the next. As I said, the biggest impact on timing is, sorry, these impact on take rate is timing. And we talked about it being raised significantly, but you're right, we are getting an increase in the overall take rate from our mix towards payments and from the fact that we gain additional revenue from payments. As I mentioned in 2021, for example, that was somewhat offset by the merchandising that we cannot do, because we couldn't merchandise and participate in pricing actions ourselves. And so we have on the payments platform, and in 2022, that again, will be largely offset by the merchandising activities. Now bear in mind, merchandising is also like marketing, we can turn up and turn it down. We think that this year in a recovering travel marketplace, there's a potentially once in a generation opportunity to really lean into both marketing and merchandising. But we are seeing improvements in take rates from the payment platform. And again, the number of, when I talked about the underlying accommodation take rate being a very constant that does not include the additions for things like payments or things that go on top payments, nor does it impact anything that we do on top of that, or does include anything we do on top of that with our merchandising activities. So hopefully, that clarifies the movements there.\nJustin Post: Great. And then on US share of nights, any help there?\nGlenn Fogel: David, I think we don't reveal that granularity.\nDavid Goulden : I think our view just as being that shared data, and we should look at share medium term basis, single quarter, very difficult to predict. We certainly believe that last year with our growth in the US being strong versus 2019. We certainly covered a lot faster than the market did in 2021.We were strong again in Q1 in the US market versus 2019. And very strong here in April so difficult to give you an individual share points. But when we look at the overall accommodations markets, which is a way to think about things, we know we picked up some share points in 2021. And we know -- we continuing to stay above where the market is in 2022, from a recovery point of view.\nGlenn Fogel: Yes, and I'd just say, look, I'm very pleased with what we've done over the last 2.5 years since this pandemic started. What we've been doing in building out our business in the US, and I made the point of how important was strategically to do better in the US because we had been under indexed in the US. And we've been doing a lot of blocking tackling over these 2.5 years in the midst of this pandemic. And we're beginning to see it come through, and I'm very pleased with the results up through Q1.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI.\nMark Mahaney: I am here. Sorry about that. David, a question for you. And then one for Glenn. David, you'd set talked about take rates this year being I think, just below 15%, or something like that. And you said that'd be a few points higher, if not for timing. So I want to ask you is does that mean that once we get beyond these unusual timing issues for a variety of factors this year, that kind of the normalized take rate is a couple of points higher like 17%, you haven't done that, your booking has done that in the past, but that's going back 5, 6, 7 years. But is that the implication of your -- of that statement? And then Glenn, about the connected trip? I wondered if you think that there's something that's structurally changed, that makes connected trip more attractive, more viable, or more impactful than it has been historically, I think about the history of online travel, and there was a connected trip company, but they never would large package business, but they never generated as many room nights as you did. And you were solo lodging company. Is there something that's changed now maybe it's much greater use of mobile or mobile apps that just makes the connected trip a greater, needle mover today than it was historically? Thanks a lot.\nDavid Goulden : Glenn, why don\u2019t you go first?\nGlenn Fogel: Do you want me to go first? So, Mark, here's the thing. I have seen over two decades, people have been talking about a connecting trip, because travel in this problem since we started buying travel online, and no human being do it for us. Certainly, the technological landscape has changed significantly, since we first started doing this when I first joined this company in 2000. And now we have so many new things that we can use to make this better, the idea of mobile apps, but even more so all the machine learning, AI to be able to do better types of predictability. What's happening, what can be better for a person, how we can see is there a potential problem in the future, we can fix it before it happens. So many things, I believe this can be done will be done, and we are the ones we're going to do. Okay, but we're not there yet. So to say it hasn't happened, it hasn't happened yet. Because we've been built all this yet. I believe it will happen. And I do believe it's necessary, because I don't believe that people should have to suffer the way they do right now in trying to do a simple family trip. That being said, though, it is going to take time, we're going to get there. But we're not going to show up next quarter or the next year to say here's the incredible increase in our business, it is going to be incremental. It's going to take time, but I absolutely believe this is where it's going to be. And David, I\u2019ll let you take yours.\nDavid Goulden : Yes, right. Thank you, Mark. So yes, let's not confuse the difference between impact on EBITDA margin and actual take rates, take rate percentages, what we talked about is the fact that let's go back to numbers so in 2019, and take rates blended across the year was 15.6%. In 2021, we said it was 14.3%. We said last quarter, it was somewhere between those two, this quarter, we gave you a bit more guidance, because we know more about the timing impact in Q1. So we said just below 15%. We said that impacts on the timing impact on take rates was causing a few points of EBITDA margin compression, so it will take a few so we said last quarter, and we still maintain that our EBITDA margin rates for the year will be a few points higher than it was in 2021. And what we said at the last call we clarify again today. If it wasn't for the impacts of timing the EBITDA margin would be a few points higher again on a normalized basis. So the fact that take rates are being hurt for the full year is causing us to have a few points of compression on our EBITDA margin this year, which is timing related. We did not say the take rates [Indiscernible] seen, we said that they were, would be below 15. And if you normalize from just below 15%, back to 15.6%, something like that, then that will give you those few points EBITDA margin that we talked about.\nMark Mahaney: Okay, yes, sorry, that was my mistake, and it can confuse you. Thanks, David. And thank you, Glenn.\nOperator: We will now take our next question comes from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you for taking the questions. So I want to come back to the comment you made in the prepared remarks on investing in supply as we go deeper into 2022. Can we talk about what kind of investments you feel you need to make? And also, as you look at the base of gross bookings in the booking window, you have now deeper into the year? Where do you find yourself with elements of supply demand imbalance on either the shared accommodation side or the hotel side that you're trying to sort of unlock or think about not only just for summer of \u201822, but beyond it to 2023? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. So may be talk a little bit about trying to build our supply areas where we think we need it. And I've talked about this in the past in the alternative accommodations area, where we think we are not as well positioned as some of our competitors, stating the fact particularly in the US, so we absolutely need to go out. And firstly, sure we got a product that people own properties want to put on our platform. That's kind of the new things I talked about in terms of the liability insurance, in terms of payment system that is actually workable and works well even that. But then we have to make people aware of this. And that's going out, we mentioned we have a new campaign out, we're spending money. And it's more than just marketing out there. It's actually individuals talking with the big owners of multiple, multiple properties, make sure they understand what we can bring to them. That's how we start to bring in more of that because we don't have the supply. You've never becoming business. So we do that. And then we obviously have the second the other side of this two sided marketplace, make sure that consumers are aware of this too and make sure they're coming to it. That's how we're going to do this over time. And it's obviously something that I've been talking about for a long time, I'm sure people will get a little tired of me saying it. But it's this is where we're going. I mentioned how we are, we did have a net increase in alternative accommodations, very pleased about that. And we are going to keep on building this. And it builds on itself. This is again, it's one of those things where it's like a snowball, and you need to get it rolling. And then it will build more and more faster and faster. It's going to take some time. I'm pleased with where it is, in terms of the window and may repeat that part of the question.\nMark Mahaney: I'm just kind of curious, like where you do see supply demand imbalances based on what you've seen in the forward booking window going into the summer and other elements of this, where maybe there are disconnects in supply versus demand by product type looking out deeper into the year.\nGlenn Fogel: Yes, so right now, we're not seeing any shortage of supply from demand, people come in, and it's not, so they're not -- they can't find anything [Indiscernible] or the rates right now. That doesn't mean and peak summer that there won't be some shortages of inventory. But that happens every normal year when there's peak summer travel in the northern hemisphere. The most popular places will fill up and most popular low key -- and most low key properties in most popular locations are going to fill up. One of the great things that we've been doing for some time is being very flexible in offering customers when they come in, and we're not having enough inventory, we think because things are filled up there. We're offering an alternative place that they could go and stay or different locations to your property all different ways. We are doing so working more different experiments to do that. But we're not the only one to do that. That's important. You have a customer in your store, you want to sell them you don't have enough of what they want you show them something else that probably he is just like, that's what we're doing. Clearly over time what I want to do, though, is not have to have this conversation about the US that we don't have enough of the single properties on the beach and XYZ. And that's something that really what we're working on, but right now I don't see an issue right now we're having insufficient supply.\nOperator: And now we will now take our last question comes from Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan.\nDoug Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about international recovery. It seems like you're suggesting it's coming more from short haul. Just curious what you're seeing in terms of long haul and how you're thinking about none of that coming back. Thanks.\nDavid Goulden : Sure. I\u2019ll start --\nGlenn Fogel: You got, Dave, start.\nDavid Goulden : Go on Glenn. I\u2019ll stop.\nGlenn Fogel: You start.\nDavid Goulden : So yes, so you're right. International recovery in total international bookings in total across borders, we define it in April is down a little bit short haul report or within Europe actually up decently, but long haul, still down, not too surprisingly, I mean total to see the international booking number close to flat for April, I think is a great step forward, not surprisingly, inter region is going to recover fast, fastest, most European countries and now relax all restrictions for travelers within Europe, which is great. And long haul still down, but also rapidly improving and we see strong growth from travelers from the US, for example, obviously travel into and from Asia is still down. And that's an important destination for both US and European people when you look at long haul routes.\nGlenn Fogel: And David you basically said what I was going to say, basically, we have a situation that is very tied somewhat to restrictions and is countries that are typical long haul destinations, some of them in Asia, for example, as they'll begin to lighten up and feel more confident they can go without having to do a lot of different things don't have to quarantine before, don't have to go to get a test they have done test before as these things go away, then people will travel more and more of these long haul trips. So I definitely and positive on the continued trend in this area.\nDoug Anmuth : Good, thank you both.\nGlenn Fogel: Okay. Was that the final question?\nOperator: Yes, that is our final question. So I will now turn the call back to Glenn Fogel for the closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Fogel: Okay, thank you. As always, I want to thank our partners, but I really want to thank all of our partners who have generously contributed to our refugee platform. Also, of course, want back to customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long term vision for our company. Thank you all and good night.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the first quarter and provide some color on trends we've seen so far in the second quarter. All growth rates for \u201822 relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now on to our results for the first quarter. On our February earnings call we discussed the improved in trends we've seen so far in 2022. With room nights getting back to about flat versus 2019 in the first half of February after declining 21% in January just hours after our earnings call on February 23, the terrible news broke the Russia invaded Ukraine. As a result, we saw an immediate negative impact on room night trends, particularly in Eastern Europe. Despite this impact towards end of the month, room nights for the full month of February came in about in line with 2019 levels. In early March, we suspended the booking of travel services in Russia and Belarus. This led to a loss of new bookings, as well as significantly elevated levels of cancellations of reservations for these countries. Additionally, we saw some slowdown in booking trends within Europe, as travelers took in the news of the invasion. We disclosed that total room nights for the week ending March 6, were down about 10%. And that slowdown was driven by Eastern Europe, primarily Russia, and to a lesser extent by Western Europe, which remained mostly above 2019 levels. I'm pleased to say that compared with the first week in March, we saw our overall trend improve during March driven mainly by Europe, resulting in room nights been down about 4% for the month, which is only a modest pullback from where we were in February. For the first quarter, room nights were down 9%, an improvement from down 21% in Q4. And our best quarter results since the onset of the pandemic. Excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, our room nights were down about 2% in March and down about 6% for the first full quarter. But Q1 on a regional level room nights in Europe and the rest of the world were both down mid-single digits. Asia was down about 35% with all three improving from Q4 levels. The US has strong growth versus Q1 2019 similar to what we saw in Q4. Mobile bookings primarily through our apps represented about 6% of our total room nights in the first quarter. Our apps were over two thirds of our mobile bookings and over 40% of total room nights. In the first quarter, we continue to see an increase mix of our total room nights coming through as the direct channel versus Q1 2019 and Q1 2022. The International mix of our total room nights in Q1 was about 40%, an encouraged increased from about 33% in Q4. Q1 International room nights were down about 30% compared to Q1 2019 levels, an improvement from the almost 40% -- for the almost 50% decline in Q4. The improvements in international bookings we saw continue to be driven mainly by travel plans within Europe. And these cross border bookings continue to have on average, longer length of stay and a shorter booking window and comparable bookings in 2019. We saw strong growth in our domestic room nights for the first quarter also an improvement from Q4. Our cancellation rates were about in line with 2019 levels in Q1 despite the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The booking window in Q1 of Booking.com contrasted less versus 2019 than it did in Q4. And this booking window expanded versus the first quarter of 2021. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, the global mix of room nights increased to about 31% in Q1, a couple points higher than 2021. Within Europe, our mixed alternative accommodation continuously, meaningfully higher than the global average. Gross bookings increased to 7% in Q1 versus 2019 and were up 10%, excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. This 7% increase in gross bookings were 16 percentage points better than 9% room night due to 18% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to strong flight bookings across the group, partially offset by about four percentage points of negative FX movements. As Glenn mentioned in his remarks, the $27 billion of gross bookings in Q1 is a new record for us higher than the previous record at $25 billion in Q1 2019. On March 2022 was the first month our gross bookings exceeded $10 billion in a single month. This was up 17% versus March 2019 and compared to up 18% in February and down 11% in January. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about three percentage points from regional mix and about 15 percentage points from rate increases in most of our regions. Notably, most notably Europe and North America, and especially in higher demand leisure oriented destinations. Constant currency ADR growth versus 2019, accelerated from 13% in Q4 to 18% in Q1, primarily due to higher rates in New York. Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up 152% versus 2019 and up 69% versus 2021, driven by continued expansion of Booking.com site platform, as well as continued flight ticket growth at Priceline. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $2.7 billion, which was down 7% versus 2019 and down about 2% on a constant currency basis, revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 150 basis points below Q1 2019 in line with our expectations, due primarily to differences between gross bookings, the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q1 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line decreased to 4% versus Q1 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings decreased about 50 basis points versus Q1 2019, which is better than our expectations, mainly due to unexpected marketing ROIs. Sales and other expenses were up 58% versus Q1 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher third party call center costs. About 34% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q1, up from 13% in Q1 2019 compared to Q1 2021, sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were about 30 basis points higher. Our more fixed expenses in aggregates were about in line with our expectations, up 12% versus Q4 and up 17% versus Q1 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $310 million for the quarter, which was better than our expectations due to unexpected ADRs. And the better than expected leverage of our variable expenses. However, sequentially EBITDA was down 67%, which is significantly more than the seasonal decline you saw pre-COVID and aligns with our commentary in February. Non-GAAP net income of $161 million results in non-GAAP EPS of $3.90 which was down 65% versus Q1 2019. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 16% was lower than 19% in Q1 2019 due to a great impact from a discrete tax benefit on a lower base earnings. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $174 million in Q1. We recorded GAAP net loss of $700 million in the quarter, which included an unrealized loss on our strategic investments of about $987 million and a $36 million loss on assets held for sale related to the Majorelle strategic partnership we discussed last quarter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of about $12.8 billion was down versus our Q4 ending balance of $14.3 billion, primarily driven by the payments of $1.1 billion for a margin debt maturity, about $950 million in share repurchases in Q1 and the declining value of our strategic investments. These factors which reduce our cash investment balance were partially offset by positive free cash flow of about $1.6 billion, which was driven almost entirely by change in working capital, resulting from an increase in our deferred merchant bookings balance. As we disclosed, on last quarter we started returning capital to shareholders in early January. And in addition to share purchases in Q1, we repurchased about $325 million of shares in April, which brings our outstanding authorization to just over $9 million. As we said before, we expect to complete our remaining authorization within the next three years. Now moving on to our thoughts for the second quarter, April room nights increased about 10% versus 2019, an improvement from the 4% decline in March, driven primarily by Europe, excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, April room nights increased about 16% versus 2019. All regions show improving room nights growth in April. Europe was up high teens percent in April and up about 30% excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth in the US was very strong, rest of world had doubled digit growth, and Asia recovers to down high teens percent all versus 2019. The international mix of our room nights in April was over 45% and encouraging increase from the 40% in Q1. April international room nights were down slightly compared to 2019 levels, an improvement from down 30% in Q1. International demand driven mainly by travel plans in Europe accounted for most of the improvements in room nights in April versus Q1. Domestic room nights also improved in April to very strong growth versus 2019. April gross bookings increased over 30% versus 2019, driven by growth in room nights continued accommodation ADR strength, as well as continued strength in flight bookings. April gross bookings increased to almost $11 billion, which was a new monthly record. April gross bookings typically declined from March pre-COVID. While it's encouraging to see continued improvements in trends into April, the environment is still uncertain and difficult to predict with confidence how room nights for the remainder of the quarter will develop. While many countries are lifting their list of travel restrictions, COVID is still a factor which can impact travel and of course, the war in Ukraine continues to create volatility and macro uncertainty. We do expect the recent strength in ADRs to continue for the remainder of the quarter. And as a result, we expect the difference between the level of room nights growth and gross bookings growth for the full second quarter to be around 20 points, which is similar to what it was in April. In April, the overall booking window Booking.com continue to move back closer to 2019 levels. We continue to see strength in our summer booking trends, and our gross bookings for summer are now more than 15% higher than they were at this time in 2019. And within Western Europe and North America both of over 30% albeit with a higher mix of cancelable bookings. If the current trends continue, we could see a record summer travel season and we're gearing up to prepare for that across all parts of our business. Turning back to Q2, given recent booking trends combined with lengthening booking window, we expect Q2 revenue as percentage of gross bookings to be about 200 basis points lower than it was in Q2 2019. This 200 basis points of difference in revenue as a percentage of gross bookings is mainly timing related, and the impact could be greater if booking trends accelerate from April, especially if a high percentage of these bookings were staged in future quarters. The timing impact on take rates in Q2 is driven by a combination of the acceleration in gross bookings from up 7% in Q1 to up over 30% so far in Q2 coupled with the lengthening booking window from Q1 to Q2, we expect our underlying accommodation take rates to remain stable. We expect marketing expense percentage of gross bookings to be slightly higher than in Q2 2019, which is consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunities for us to lean into recovering travel market in 2022. We expect Q2 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 60 basis points higher than it was in Q2, 2021 due to higher virtual booking mix and higher third party call center costs. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate to be about 15% higher than in Q2 2021. With personnel down slightly on both G&A and IT up meaningfully versus Q2 last year. The overall year-on-year increase in G&A is driven by higher digital sales taxes, which is tied to revenue as well as increased office expenses due to return to hybrid work environments. We expect IT to increase year-over-year at similar rates to what we saw in Q1. If we were to see similar top line growth rates for the rest of the quarter we saw in April, we'd expect adjusted EBITDA to be over $900 million for the quarter. The expected timing difference between gross bookings and revenue which is the primary driver are expected 200 basis points lower take rate than Q1 2019 will have a significant negative impact on EBITDA in Q2 as our more variable expense lines are linked to bookings. If we normalize the timing impact on our take rates in Q2 2022 to be the same as it was in Q2 2019, adjusted EBITDA in Q2 2022 will be slightly higher than it was in Q2 2019. Now turning to the enhanced strategic partnership with Majorelle we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, Majorelle one of our most trusted long term external customer support partners will begin employing most of the customer service representatives and previous work for Booking.com outside of the Netherlands and the UK. We currently anticipate finalizing sponsorship around the middle of the year. And following the anticipated closing on a quarterly basis in the second half of 2022, we expect the personnel expenses will be lowered by about $25 million a quarter, but G&A expenses will be lower by $6 million a quarter. And our external expenses will increase to offset the lower personnel and G&A expenses. As we said last quarter, we did not anticipate much of an impact on adjusted EBITDA in 2022 from this initiative beyond 2022. We believe this partnership will help reduce further expense growth and enable a more efficient ramp up of our customer service function. Outside of the P&L geography changes to the personnel G&A and sales and other expense line from Majorelle, we are maintaining the full year P&L commentary we provided last quarter. As a reminder, the expected timing, we expect timing to know the impact take rates. The precise impact timing on our take rates for the year is difficult to predict as it is impacted by the rate of recovery of bookings coming into and during the year. And also by the length of booking windows during the year. We do know the relative to 2021 there was a negative impact on our take rates due to timing in Q1 2022. Our current best estimates of take rates in 2022 is just below 15%, which is lower than 2019 primarily due to timing. We expect the underlying accommodation take rates will remain stable. Timing also negatively impacted adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins for the year. If not impacted timing our expectations for full year EBITDA margins will be a few points higher than our guidance for the year. We're encouraged by our better than expected Q1 results and the strengthening trends we've seen in April, and we are confident that our focus on customer acquisition and expanding our product offerings is the right approach for 2022. We'll now take the questions. Shawn, over to you, please for Q&A. Maybe, Glenn, just maybe a couple extra points on what we're seeing in April and March, we did see a steady progression from that first week in March where things were minus 10, up through March and April on a fairly steady basis, week on week. But as Glenn said, there's still a lot out there and the environment it's hard to predict. I would call it this Easter happened in April in both periods. So there's no Easter effect there relative to the growth rates versus 2019 August 2021 for that matter, either. Relative to longer term take rates. And I explained on the call, take rates are the impact timing on take rates is a mathematical impact of the difference between the amounts that you spill into the year from the prior year, and the amount you still out in the current year into the next year. And of course, that can be variable based upon effects. We saw this year, we said that there was a hurting Q1 on timing effects on take rates, because that's when Omicron basically came up with into Q4, and that results in less booking still into Q1 than we would expect. So it's really going to be a function of how the recovery develops in total in terms of how rapidly things recover, and also just the timing of that recovery. So as growth rate starts to normalize, and get back to more normal level, you expect the impact upon the take rea, the timing impact on take rates to come down. But then there could be some additional factors that could impact those specific things relative to what happens about the prior Q4 going into Q1, and the next Q4 going into the future Q1. So normally, and as the growth rates start to normalize the roles of revenue growth rates and booking growth rates start to align more, there will be less effect. But there could still be unusual effects they have, like what we've seen before that could impact the specific timing of Q1 and Q4, and the relative difference between those quarters across the years. Yes, Brian, let me go first. So with the exception of the mechanical movements, I'll talk about how they impact things little bit, the mechanical moves relative to Majorelle, which are basically just P&L geography movements. We're not, I'm not changing what we said last time. We do expect some deleverage in marketing to gross bookings for the year. We said we expected in Q1 to be relatively flat, we were a little bit better that we were actually 50 points \u2013 50 bps leveraging in Q1 due to a higher ROI, but we did say we'd be leaning into the busy travel season more in Q2 and Q3. So we're still expecting to see some level of deleverage during the year and also increased spending on merchandising, sales and others, we still expect that to be about 50 bps for the year that's tied to payments, the mechanics of the Majorelle adjustment with moving those additional expenses into [Indiscernible] would be less than 10 bps although that are adjustments again as to TGV. So essentially, with the exception of the mechanical movements, what we talked about for the last, what we talked about quarter go for how we see the year shaping up, we still expect to see the shaping up the same way. And of course, I've given you some additional color on take rates we didn't provide last quarter so that gives you a little bit more color than we gave you on quarter because we now know what happened in Q1 so we can give you a bit more guidance around that. I think, Glenn, let we go where you went, because this is just not one geography. We're seeing all geographies improve in April, which for us is very encouraging. So we mentioned that Europe is now April back into high teen growth versus 2019. That is really encouraging and really the first time we've been able to talk about growth over 2019 in Europe, this is for room nights, US back to very strong growth versus 2019, which we think is well ahead of the market. And Glenn mentioned some of the factors, the APAC recovering nicely, down, still down but down IT is not, again the best result we've seen since the start of pandemic, and the rest of world backup to double digits, so all nice improvements from Q1, all nice improves to March, so it's not just one reason we're seeing it across the world, which I think is a positive sign, I mentioned that we will be leaning a little bit more, expect to leaning in more in Q2 than in we did in Q1, relative to the amount of spending and the ROI. But as we said, that is really in response to the opportunity to capture demand. When we see demand, and we see traffic on this site, that's when we can start increasing our marketing spend. So we're really responding to the opportunity of recovering travel. And whereas we see travel for that's when we can lead in sort of leaning in, particularly in Q3 of last year, you saw us do that in prior quarters. So it's early during the quarter, but that's why we said we expect it to be at a small level of deleveraging this quarter in marketing, but the impact we're seeing and the change we're seeing from March to April is very positive. Yes, that's a reported number. And currency is an impact for what it is worth when we did our guidance, and we did our calculations here we had your [Indiscernible] come down a little bit doesn't make a huge amount of difference. But the numbers we gave you or reported unless we call some out specifically as constant currency, for example, we call our constant currency ADRs. For example, everything else is reporting. Yes, I talked about, so when we talk about the underlying take rates, we're talking about the basic take rate on the -- or the commission on the room. We're not factoring in payments to that at all, or motion the next. As I said, the biggest impact on timing is, sorry, these impact on take rate is timing. And we talked about it being raised significantly, but you're right, we are getting an increase in the overall take rate from our mix towards payments and from the fact that we gain additional revenue from payments. As I mentioned in 2021, for example, that was somewhat offset by the merchandising that we cannot do, because we couldn't merchandise and participate in pricing actions ourselves. And so we have on the payments platform, and in 2022, that again, will be largely offset by the merchandising activities. Now bear in mind, merchandising is also like marketing, we can turn up and turn it down. We think that this year in a recovering travel marketplace, there's a potentially once in a generation opportunity to really lean into both marketing and merchandising. But we are seeing improvements in take rates from the payment platform. And again, the number of, when I talked about the underlying accommodation take rate being a very constant that does not include the additions for things like payments or things that go on top payments, nor does it impact anything that we do on top of that, or does include anything we do on top of that with our merchandising activities. So hopefully, that clarifies the movements there. I think our view just as being that shared data, and we should look at share medium term basis, single quarter, very difficult to predict. We certainly believe that last year with our growth in the US being strong versus 2019. We certainly covered a lot faster than the market did in 2021.We were strong again in Q1 in the US market versus 2019. And very strong here in April so difficult to give you an individual share points. But when we look at the overall accommodations markets, which is a way to think about things, we know we picked up some share points in 2021. And we know -- we continuing to stay above where the market is in 2022, from a recovery point of view. Glenn, why don't you go first? Yes, right. Thank you, Mark. So yes, let's not confuse the difference between impact on EBITDA margin and actual take rates, take rate percentages, what we talked about is the fact that let's go back to numbers so in 2019, and take rates blended across the year was 15.6%. In 2021, we said it was 14.3%. We said last quarter, it was somewhere between those two, this quarter, we gave you a bit more guidance, because we know more about the timing impact in Q1. So we said just below 15%. We said that impacts on the timing impact on take rates was causing a few points of EBITDA margin compression, so it will take a few so we said last quarter, and we still maintain that our EBITDA margin rates for the year will be a few points higher than it was in 2021. And what we said at the last call we clarify again today. If it wasn't for the impacts of timing the EBITDA margin would be a few points higher again on a normalized basis. So the fact that take rates are being hurt for the full year is causing us to have a few points of compression on our EBITDA margin this year, which is timing related. We did not say the take rates [Indiscernible] seen, we said that they were, would be below 15. And if you normalize from just below 15%, back to 15.6%, something like that, then that will give you those few points EBITDA margin that we talked about. Sure. I'll start -- Go on Glenn. I'll stop. So yes, so you're right. International recovery in total international bookings in total across borders, we define it in April is down a little bit short haul report or within Europe actually up decently, but long haul, still down, not too surprisingly, I mean total to see the international booking number close to flat for April, I think is a great step forward, not surprisingly, inter region is going to recover fast, fastest, most European countries and now relax all restrictions for travelers within Europe, which is great. And long haul still down, but also rapidly improving and we see strong growth from travelers from the US, for example, obviously travel into and from Asia is still down. And that's an important destination for both US and European people when you look at long haul routes."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to begin by reporting that our first quarter was a record. Our customers booked $27 billion in gross bookings, the highest quarterly amount ever. The continued improvement in our room night trends, increased accommodation ADRs and significant growth in our global flights product all contributed to achieving this gross bookings record. In our accommodations business, we saw meaningful improvement from last year, with first quarter room nights declining only 9% versus Q1 2019 which was an improvement of 12 percentage points from our fourth quarter 2021 results. Our bookings continued to strengthen in April, with roommates increasing 10% and gross bookings up over 30% versus 2019, making April a record month for gross bookings and our first month that global room nights exceeded 2019 levels. @Booking.com, I'm encouraged by the strong gross bookings already recorded for the summer period, which are over 15% higher than at this same point in 2019. In Western Europe and North America, gross bookings for the summer period are now over 30% ahead of where we were at this point in 2019. Though, I know that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable. Of course, our brands or other brands, we are seeing the benefits of a global recovery from the pandemic with strong travel demand in the US for Priceline, a rapid recent improvement and trends in Asia for Agoda and uptick in international flight searches at KAYAK and the return of diners to restaurants for OpenTable. In many countries, especially across Europe and Asia, travel restrictions were eased in the first quarter, which we believe has contributed to the strengthening of travel demand trends. As we have said before, with leisure travelers believe it is safe to travel and restrictions are lifted, people booked travel. With that being said, there are still restrictions and inconveniences imposed on travelers today by some countries, though we believe that the industry is moving in the right direction and progressing back to normalcy. While we are pleased with the trends we're seeing right now across our brands, as we look towards the rest of the year, we are cognizant of the potential for macro uncertainty, and are aware that inflation or other macro factors may have an impact on consumer demand. And before providing further updates on our business, I want to address the devastating war in Ukraine. Since first hearing the terrible news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, our first priority was the safety of our colleagues and supporting them through this time. We worked closely with our employees and their families in Ukraine to provide them with safe refuge, and we have continued to support humanitarian efforts in the region. As we previously disclosed in early March, we suspended travel services in Russia and Belarus. By mid-March Booking.com Booking.com, developed and launched a no commission initiative that enabled properties in select European countries to offer free or heavily discounted accommodations to refugees fleeing Ukraine. We believe that about 30,000 refugees have been provided with places to stay through this initiative so far. We continue to work closely with our hotel and home partners, and expect to expand this program to more properties in the region. As an example, Booking.com has partnered with Hilton and the UN Refugee Agency to make it easy for NGOs to book temporary accommodations on behalf of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine. These rooms have been made available for free by Hilton at hundreds of their properties across Europe, which we in turn are providing through our platform. I am very proud of our team's quick actions to help our employees, customers, partners and the many people impacted by these tragic events. And, of course, we all hope this barbaric violence end soon. Let's now turn to the progress we're making in our business. We continue our work strengthening our core accommodation business by driving benefits to our traveler customers and to our supply partners. For our customers, we are focused on their critical needs of value, choice and convenience. With this high degree of customer focus, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend, and direct relationships with our customers over time. In March, our unique active Booking.com customers at Booking.com were within 95% of 2019 levels, driven by strong growth in returning customers who had not made a previous booking in over a year. In the first quarter, we saw a higher mix of customers booking directly with us than any of the last three quarters first quarters, three years first quarters. We see the strongest direct repeat customer behavior in our mobile app than when compared to other platforms like desktop or mobile web. We continue to see more of our business shift to the app with over 40% of our room nights booked through our apps in the first quarter. Booking.com's app hit a new record in terms of monthly active users in Q1 and continue to be the number one downloaded OTA app globally, according to a third-party research firm. As I said before, the app is a critical platform, as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. And ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app to build on the recent success we have seen here. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform, which primarily means bringing incremental demand to properties from the broad audience of potential customers on our platform. For alternative accommodations, our global mix of room nights in the first quarter increased to about 31%, a couple of points higher than in Q1 2021. We continue to work on improving our alternative accommodation product globally with an additional focus on the US market. We've been working closely with property partners to identify opportunities to improve our platform to better fit their needs. Related to these efforts, we launched partner liability insurance for our alternative accommodation supply partners with global coverage in the first quarter. In addition, we are making progress on an enhanced payment solution for professional property managers that we're rolling out in the US. In the first quarter, we saw the largest sequential net increase in alternative accommodation properties on Booking.com since the start of the pandemic. While the net increase in Q1 was still a modest number of properties, we're aiming to build on this growth throughout 2022 by continuing to improve our alternative accommodation offering and attracting more partners to our platform. In this week, we launched a new campaign in the US to promote Booking.com to alternative accommodation owners and managers who want to grow their business with us. Let me now talk about the progress we've made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trend. We believe both of these priorities will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth. On payments, 34% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the first quarter, which is our highest quarterly level ever. This year, we are focused on continuing to increase supplier adoption of payments, while introducing new products and features that over time will improve the customer and partner experience and bring new revenue streams to our platform. We will continue to position Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment service for both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, Booking.com's payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger Connected Trip Vision. On our Connected Trip Vision, we continue to make progress as we work on the foundations such as developing a flight offering on Booking.com, which is now live in 40 countries. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process, and allows us an opportunity to core sell our accommodation and other services to these flight bookers. We have seen that in over 70% of our flight bookings on Booking.com, the flight was the first or only product that was booked. This helps confirm the value of flights as the starting point in many people's booking journey, and is an anchor part that we can utilize to cross-sell accommodations and other products, a meaningful percentage of bookers who first book a flight, then book an accommodation. We'll continue our work to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity, and build on the early positive signals that we're seeing so far. Flights continues to be a source for new customers, with about one quarter of all flight bookers in Q1 being new customers for Booking.com. We've also seen recent success driving incremental room nights and experiments where discounts are applied to non-accommodation products that were attached to the transaction. To put it simply, we believe having more products on the shelf, increases our merchandising opportunities, and helps us sell more room nights. Finally, as I previewed on our last earnings call, we published our 2021 sustainability report and our Climate Action Plan in March. In our Climate Action Plan, we highlighted the significant emission reductions we've already achieved, in part driven by sourcing 100% renewable energy for our office by the end of last year. And we are committed to more than halving our emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2040. We are proud of the emissions reduction achieved and ambitious target set for our business. But as I said before, we believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through making it easier for travelers to find and book sustainable options. We are addressing this opportunity through our work with our Travel Still Badging program, which now includes over 100,000 properties that can highlight their sustainable practices to customers on Booking.com. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strength we are seeing in bookings, the level of summer travel on our books and the potential for a very busy travel year ahead. As we discussed last quarter, in this recovery environment, we will continue to lean into performance marketing channels and appropriate ROIs as we look to bring more customer demand to our platform. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue capturing this returning travel demand. And we will continue our work executing against our strategic priorities. As I said before, we are focusing on building a larger and faster growing business with more products that is sustainable, and generates more earnings dollars for the long run. Now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. Hi, Lloyd. While I'll take that first one, I'll let David go back over the timing issues that you just asked about. So your question really is trying to predict the future, which is always an interesting adventure, particularly over the last couple of years that we've all gone through. As I've said, David was saying, we're very pleased with where we are. And we're happy with what's happening. I think everybody around the world is happy about travel coming back. And we've mentioned how some of the trends that we're like -- that we like seeing in Asia where things are getting better, we know they're not as good as they are in Europe or in the US. That's a good positive sign. Hopefully that will continue. We're also pleased with the things that we've been saying that throughout Europe and Western Europe and Eastern Europe coming back that so we're all very happy where we are, but we never know. We never know what's going to happen. You know that we've done this. We had a call, our last call. And then there was a terrible, terrible news shortly thereafter, what happened in Ukraine and if you recall going back a quarter before that, COVIND omicron came out of nowhere. So we all know that the world is, let's say volatile right now. But I will say I am happy where we are. And I'm pleased with the incredible good job of execution our team has done. And, David, I'm not sure you want to add any more than that. David, you want to do that first one? And, Brian, talking about connected trip. So connected trip is a long term vision. And it's going to take some time before we get to where I believe we need to be in terms of a truly step functional change in the way people are currently, by exploring going through travel, I think we all know how difficult it is. And we all know that it should be better. So that's the goal down the road. In 2023, we're still going to be pretty early in this, I think I would think it's, we're still in the base level of just getting great verticals up and running, so that they by themselves are fantastic, good product for people to use. And then just the basic-cross selling things that we think is a first step to get towards that connected trip. And if you ask me one of the biggest things for 2023. Well, the things I just talked about right now flights right now, I really liked the fact again, the new customers coming in, and they're coming in, they're buying a meaningful number of buyer combinations. And we haven't optimized this yet. That's something important. Then on top of that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks about just beginning small experiments with other types of verticals, and how putting these things together can give a better experience to a customer. The great thing about these things is trying to build a belief that coming to us to Booking.com is the best way to go. So getting more repeat business and getting this do it on the app, so that we don't pay for that person to come and increase that loyalty. So there's a lot of ways trying to increase this flywheel. So people know the products better and coming to us. And as we continue to do that, get more information, be able to provide a better proposal to them a better offer to them that they can work more easily. And it continues to build on its own. It's going to take time, though. And in 2023, I don't think you're going to see huge numbers from all things I just talked about. But you will see incremental improvement. So let me tell you in general, and David, I'm not sure you want to talk in terms of any sort of numbers and levers or whatever. But yes, we are very pleased with what we're seeing. But I believe it's a combination of many things that we're working on is really is a game of execution in the small details, means you're working with partners and getting the right price, the right inventory. And then it's making sure we're showing it to the customer at the right time in the right way. And it means also doing things we're talking about with alternative accommodations, bring in a few, bringing in some incremental more supply there, making sure we're working to come up with ways that works better, so that the customers having a better experience and their payments are more smooth, et cetera. I can go through a lot of little things that we're working on. And each one builds on its own. It makes it a better experience. Now, yes, we have a brand effort in the US, as you hopefully remember back from our Super Bowl, we, I believe a very good ad and we're continuing this is not just a one and done. It's a campaign. And we tie that with some efforts in social and we're doing a lot of different things to try to increase our awareness getting that top of mind awareness in the US, for example, helping build that. But this is a global effort really, in terms of trying to build our business by doing all the little things that make it a better product, because in the long run, the better product is what's going to win. And David, I don't know, if you want to speak anything specific in terms of ROIs or levers right there and nature. Dave, why don't you take that? And I'll just turn my [indiscernible]... David, I think we don't reveal that granularity. Yes, and I'd just say, look, I'm very pleased with what we've done over the last 2.5 years since this pandemic started. What we've been doing in building out our business in the US, and I made the point of how important was strategically to do better in the US because we had been under indexed in the US. And we've been doing a lot of blocking tackling over these 2.5 years in the midst of this pandemic. And we're beginning to see it come through, and I'm very pleased with the results up through Q1. Do you want me to go first? So, Mark, here's the thing. I have seen over two decades, people have been talking about a connecting trip, because travel in this problem since we started buying travel online, and no human being do it for us. Certainly, the technological landscape has changed significantly, since we first started doing this when I first joined this company in 2000. And now we have so many new things that we can use to make this better, the idea of mobile apps, but even more so all the machine learning, AI to be able to do better types of predictability. What's happening, what can be better for a person, how we can see is there a potential problem in the future, we can fix it before it happens. So many things, I believe this can be done will be done, and we are the ones we're going to do. Okay, but we're not there yet. So to say it hasn't happened, it hasn't happened yet. Because we've been built all this yet. I believe it will happen. And I do believe it's necessary, because I don't believe that people should have to suffer the way they do right now in trying to do a simple family trip. That being said, though, it is going to take time, we're going to get there. But we're not going to show up next quarter or the next year to say here's the incredible increase in our business, it is going to be incremental. It's going to take time, but I absolutely believe this is where it's going to be. And David, I'll let you take yours. Sure. So may be talk a little bit about trying to build our supply areas where we think we need it. And I've talked about this in the past in the alternative accommodations area, where we think we are not as well positioned as some of our competitors, stating the fact particularly in the US, so we absolutely need to go out. And firstly, sure we got a product that people own properties want to put on our platform. That's kind of the new things I talked about in terms of the liability insurance, in terms of payment system that is actually workable and works well even that. But then we have to make people aware of this. And that's going out, we mentioned we have a new campaign out, we're spending money. And it's more than just marketing out there. It's actually individuals talking with the big owners of multiple, multiple properties, make sure they understand what we can bring to them. That's how we start to bring in more of that because we don't have the supply. You've never becoming business. So we do that. And then we obviously have the second the other side of this two sided marketplace, make sure that consumers are aware of this too and make sure they're coming to it. That's how we're going to do this over time. And it's obviously something that I've been talking about for a long time, I'm sure people will get a little tired of me saying it. But it's this is where we're going. I mentioned how we are, we did have a net increase in alternative accommodations, very pleased about that. And we are going to keep on building this. And it builds on itself. This is again, it's one of those things where it's like a snowball, and you need to get it rolling. And then it will build more and more faster and faster. It's going to take some time. I'm pleased with where it is, in terms of the window and may repeat that part of the question. Yes, so right now, we're not seeing any shortage of supply from demand, people come in, and it's not, so they're not -- they can't find anything [Indiscernible] or the rates right now. That doesn't mean and peak summer that there won't be some shortages of inventory. But that happens every normal year when there's peak summer travel in the northern hemisphere. The most popular places will fill up and most popular low key -- and most low key properties in most popular locations are going to fill up. One of the great things that we've been doing for some time is being very flexible in offering customers when they come in, and we're not having enough inventory, we think because things are filled up there. We're offering an alternative place that they could go and stay or different locations to your property all different ways. We are doing so working more different experiments to do that. But we're not the only one to do that. That's important. You have a customer in your store, you want to sell them you don't have enough of what they want you show them something else that probably he is just like, that's what we're doing. Clearly over time what I want to do, though, is not have to have this conversation about the US that we don't have enough of the single properties on the beach and XYZ. And that's something that really what we're working on, but right now I don't see an issue right now we're having insufficient supply. You got, Dave, start. You start. And David you basically said what I was going to say, basically, we have a situation that is very tied somewhat to restrictions and is countries that are typical long haul destinations, some of them in Asia, for example, as they'll begin to lighten up and feel more confident they can go without having to do a lot of different things don't have to quarantine before, don't have to go to get a test they have done test before as these things go away, then people will travel more and more of these long haul trips. So I definitely and positive on the continued trend in this area. Okay. Was that the final question? Okay, thank you. As always, I want to thank our partners, but I really want to thank all of our partners who have generously contributed to our refugee platform. Also, of course, want back to customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long term vision for our company. Thank you all and good night."

And now I\u2019d like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Please go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings\u2019 fourth quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report a solid finish to 2023 as fourth quarter room nights slightly exceeded our expectations and grew a bit more than 9% year-over-year or 11% when excludes Israel from both periods. When compared to 2019, our room nights grew 21% versus our expectations of 20%. We delivered record fourth quarter revenue of $4.8 billion and record adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which were ahead of our expectations. Finally, the GAAP and earnings per share in the quarter grew 29% year-over-year, helped by the reduction in our share count versus last year. At the start of 2024, we continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand. As we look to the year ahead, we see strong growth on the books for travel that\u2019s scheduled to take place in 2024, which gives early indications of potentially another record summer travel season. As we\u2019ve noted previously, a high percentage of these bookings are capable and what is on the books today for the summer period represents a small percentage of the total bookings that we expect to ultimately receive. David will provide further details on fourth quarter results and on our thoughts about the first quarter and full year 2024. Looking back at the full year of 2023, I am proud of our efforts to drive more benefits to our travelers and supply partners while also delivering record-setting industry-leading financial results. We reached a significant milestone last year with our customers\u2019 booking an all-time high of over 1 billion room nights on our platform, which was an increase of 17% versus 2022. Gross bookings of $151 billion increased 24% versus 2022. In 2023, we reached a new revenue record of over $21 billion, which was 25% higher than 2022. We achieved this strong top line result while improving our profitability with record adjusted EBITDA of $7.1 billion, an increase of 34% versus 2022, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by over 2 percentage points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of about $152 increased 52% year-over-year and was 48% higher than our prior full year all-time high back in 2019. Across all of our key metrics in 2023, we were a meaningfully larger and faster-growing business than we were in 2019. Our ambition going forward in a normalized growth in market for the travel industry is to continue to grow our gross bookings, revenue and earnings per share faster than we did in 2019. We are confident we will achieve these objectives because we\u2019ve invested in building a stronger business and better product offerings for our travelers and partners that we had back then. We can see this in many areas, but I will highlight a few examples of where we have strengthened our offering relative to 2019. We now have a scaled up merchant platform at Booking.com, which processed first half of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings in 2023. Our merchant offering brings many benefits to our travelers and partners as well as new strategic benefits to us, including the ability to merchandise. We have continued to scale up our offering at Booking.com since in 2019, with total company air tickets booked in 2023 up more than 400% over that time frame, primarily driven by Booking.com. We see this vertical bring new customers to our platform while delivering a more complete offering to our existing customers making travel planning and booking easier for them and creating opportunities to provide more value to them. On alternative accommodations, we continue to increase the mix of our alternative accommodations room nights, which treats 33% of Booking.com\u2019s room rights in 2023 as we improve our product offering and increase our supply choices with further opportunities ahead, particularly in the U.S. Early, we are pleased that for Booking.com, we have created foundations necessary to offer insurance, attractions and ground transportation options and expect these offerings to add value to our connected trip vision. On marketing, we\u2019ve improved our abilities in using performance marketing channels even more effectively and are now better focused on our brand spending. On loyalty, we\u2019ve expanded and enhanced our loyalty program, Booking.com to deliver more benefits to more of our traveler customers with more of our property and rental car partners participating. And lastly, we are continuing to strengthen the direct relationship with our travelers as our mobile app room nights and total direct room nights continue to increase in our mix. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry, which we believe will grow faster than GDP growth across our core markets. With that foundation of industry growth and the improvements we\u2019ve made to strengthen our offerings, we are positive about our future and believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years. With our long-term positive outlook, solid financial performance and strong balance sheet, we returned over $10 billion to shareholders during 2023 by repurchasing our shares. Returning capital to shareholders will remain a high priority for the company going forward. And today, we are taking another important step in that journey by announcing that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend to complement our existing share repurchase program. David will provide further thoughts on our approach to capital returns in his remarks. In addition to our strong financial results in 2023, we made meaningful progress against our key strategic priorities, which include: advancing our connected trip vision, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, supporting our supply partners and growing alternative accommodations and building more direct relationships with our traveler customers. Let me address the progress we have made in each of these areas. On the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make planning, booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. We believe this is important because we know the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented and frustrating to travelers than it should be. The contribution aims to greatly improve that experience for consumers which we believe will drive further differentiation of our offerings and lead to improved loyalty, increase direct bookings, higher frequency and a greater share of total travel spend on our platform over time. This is good not only for our travelers, but also for our partner suppliers who will be able to utilize different elements of the connected trip to obtain additional business in an efficient and lower cost way. As we continue to make progress in developing the connected trip, you will see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform that moves us closer to this long-term vision. This approach allows us to realize benefits while we are building towards that future state. In fact, some of the key improvements to our platform over the last few years that I spoke about earlier were driven by our work on the connected trip. For example, our emerging platform at Booking.com is a foundational base to the connected trip, and it helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience for our travelers. Plus, it enables us to smartly merchandise a variety of partner and self-supply offers when appropriate. Another example would be the development of flights on Booking.com, with flights being one of the most important elements of travel outside of accommodations. In 2023, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 58% year-over-year driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com site offering. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers to Booking.com through the flight vertical, and are encouraged by the right that these customers book other services on our platform. Outside of flights and accommodations, we need solid progress in expanding the breadth of our attraction supply that is available to our travelers. While we do not expect attractions to be a major financial contributor on its own, we see benefits from a strong attractions offering given the potential bundling opportunities as we will see ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination. Overall, we believe we have made great progress in building toward our Connected revision and we are starting to see early signs of the benefits. We continue to see a growing percentage of transactions, which we count as connectors though these are still a small percentage of our total transactions today. Importantly, we see these types of customers returning to us more frequently, and we point to experiment with expanding Genius program to include all travel verticals in 2024, which we expect will drive more value to travelers across the different elements of the connected trip. We plan to continue to build out our Connected Trip vision, which we believe will result in increased travel and supplier engagement with our platform. In order to achieve the easier and more personalized experience of the Connected Trip, we have always envisioned AI technology playing a central role. Over the last few quarters, I have discussed the hard work our teams have been doing to integrate generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Booking.com\u2019s AI trip planner and Priceline\u2019s generative AI travels \u2013 named Penny. After launching Booking.com\u2019s AI trip planner in the U.S. last summer, we expanded the rollout to the UK market in the fourth quarter. At this early stage, the team remains focused. I learn more about customers who want to interact with the tool and what types of questions they will ask. We see the AI trip planner is getting better answering customers\u2019 inquiries and we are excited to start testing other verticals out of accommodations. At Priceline, last week, they announced their weaker product release, which included several enhancements to Penny following 6 months of real-world interaction with users that resulted in valuable learnings from the Priceline team. Priceline\u2019s AI travel assisted product can now help travelers be on just the hotel category as it now covers flights, car rentals and vacation packages. While was nicely launched at the end of the booking funnel on the checkout page, it is now available on the Priceline homepage where it can help with travel planning, booking and modifying a trip as we booked. This is a clear example of how our teams iterate and enhance our AI-powered products as we learn more through user interactions. We continue to see encouraging signs that Priceline\u2019s Penny product helps lower customer service contact across travel verticals, and we believe, improves the customer experience. Beyond improving customer service contact rates, we believe that, over time, we can leverage generative AI technology to help make our customer service agents more efficient across our entire Outside of customer service, we continue to explore areas where we believe we can use generative AI tools to increase productivity. We have early indications that using generative AI enhances the productivity of our software developers and are encouraged by the results so far. We look forward to experimenting with these and other ways Gen AI tools might make our business more efficient in the future. Turning to our supply partners. We strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform. And we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental bookings and developing products and features to help support their businesses. The majority of our partners are small independent businesses, and we are pleased to see many are reporting significantly improved business performance over the last year. We believe that helping our smaller partners thrive contributes to the long-term diversity and sustainability of our sector. One area in which we work with many small independent businesses is through our alternative combination offering comp. This is an area which we have continued to strengthen our business, increasing supply and raising product awareness on many travelers. Also combination room nights grew 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 24% for the full year, which was faster our traditional hotel category. We saw meaningfully higher growth in our U.S. alternative accommodation room nights, though this is all a relatively small Globally, alternative accommodations represented about 33% of Booking.com\u2019s total room nights in 2023, which was 3 percentage points higher than in 2022. Our strong trend of accommodation room nights growth is benefiting from having more listings available on our platform were travelers to choose from. We are seeing continued momentum in annual turn combination supply both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about 7.4 million by the end of 2023, which is about 12% higher than the 6.6 million last year. We\u2019re focused on continuing to build on this progress by further improving the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increasing loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. I am encouraged that in 2023 at Booking.com, we had strong growth in our base of our peak bookers, demonstrating strong retention, while we\u2019re also pleased with the increase in the number of new users to our platform versus 2022. We\u2019re also strengthening the direct relationship with our travelers as our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continues to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter and when measured for the full year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. Our mix overnight through our mobile apps increased year-over-year by about 5 percentage points for the full year to 49%. Booking.com remained the number one downloaded travel app in the world in 2023. In Asia, Booking.com and Agoda are top five travel apps. And in the U.S. Booking.com, Priceline and OpenTable are all in the top 10 travel apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. Finally, I want to briefly address a regulatory matter that\u2019s impacting the financial results we are reporting today. The Spanish Competition Authority has issued a draft decision alleging infringement by Booking.com of Spanish competition law and then intends to issue a fine of $530 million. We could not disagree more with this draft decision and the arbitrarily large fine that they imposed, which is completely disproportionate to the alleged conduct. If the draft decision were to become fine, we plan to appeal. The success of our business is built on a mutually beneficial and balanced partnership with our millions of hotels and other accommodation partners around the world. We provide exceptional choice, value and service for travelers and we provide a marketplace for hotels and other partners that allows them to attract travelers from around the world at lower cost than many other marketing channels. We have a clear track record of cooperating with many competition and consumer authorities to find amicable and workable solutions to their concerns, including working with the year being commission on the Digital Markets Act. As we have previously disclosed, we plan to file our notification for designation under the DMA suit. And we believe the main concerns raised by the Spanish Authority overlap with the DMA. We will continue to work closely with these regulatory bodies to maintain consistent rules. And most importantly, we will continue to ensure that we are offering the best possible platform to our partners and our customers. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong fourth quarter results and the continued of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well over the long-term. We continue our work to deliver a better offering experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We are confident in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our results for the fourth quarter and provide some color on the trends we see in the first quarter and \u2013 on 2024. All growth rates are on a year-on-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. One housekeeping item before discussing our results. We have reclassified digital services taxes into sales and other expenses and out of G&A expense. Due to the highly variable nature of GSTs, which are tied to the revenue earned in the countries where GST are enacted. We have provided a table with two areas of updated quarterly financials in our earnings press release that reflects this chain P&L geography, and all of my comments on this call will also reflect the change. Now on to our quarter results. Our room nights in the fourth quarter grew 9% year-over-year and 21% versus 2019, which was slightly better than our expectations of about 9% and 20%. Excluding Israel, Q4 room rights were up 11% versus 2022 and 22% versus 2019. Looking at our year-over-year room nights by region in the fourth quarter, Asia was up mid-teens Europe was up low double digits, Rest of World was up low single digits, and the U.S. was flat. All regions improved from October. The average booking window of Booking.com expanded in Q4 versus the same period in both 2022 and 2019, but was a bit less expanded than it was in the third quarter.  In Q4, mobile app mix of about 53% was about 5 percentage points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the fourth quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2022. The international mix of our room nights in Q4 was 50%, up from about 48% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and reaching about the same level as the pre-pandemic Q4 mix. Our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was slightly higher than Q4 2022, impacted by the war in the Middle East. As we expected, the higher overall cancellation in October normalized by the end of the quarter. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q4 room night growth was 19% year-over-year, and the global mix of alternative body room nights was about 32%, which was up versus about 29% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Q4 gross bookings increased 16% year-over-year or about 15% on a constant currency basis, which was ahead of our expectations. The 16% increase in gross bookings was 7 percentage points higher than the 9% room night growth due to about 4% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, plus over 1 percentage point of positive impact from each of FX movements and flight bookings. Our year-over-year ADR growth was natively impacted by regional mix due to higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 5 percentage points year-over-year. Despite higher ADRs in the fourth quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in the length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch the dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up about 46% year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Booking.com\u2019s flight offering. Revenue for the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 18% year-over-year or about 17% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.1%, which was about in line with our expectations. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 9% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 30 basis points lower than Q4 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of business. Performance margin ROIs increased year-over-year, helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q4 was about 15 basis points lower than last year, which was better than our expectation due to lower merchandising expense, higher direct mix and better performance marketing ROIs. Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 20 basis points compared with last year and also about 20 basis points above our expectation normalize for the DST reclassification, due in large parts to higher accounts receivable provisions related to our decision to delay some collections during the partner payment issue we discussed last quarter. We do not expect this to be an ongoing issue. More fixed expenses in aggregate were up 21% year-over-year, which was below our expectations primarily due to lower personnel and IT expense as well as due to the DST reclassification. 21% is calculated usually on non-GAAP expenses in both Q4 2023 and Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA of almost $1.5 billion was ahead of our expectation and was up 18% year-over-year and would have been about 22% on a constant currency basis. Separately, Q4 adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by a $37 million loss recorded in other income related to the devaluation of the Argentinian peso, which is not factored into our prior guidance. This reduced Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin by almost 1%. Non-GAAP net income of $1.1 billion resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $32 a share, which was up 29% year-over-year. Our average share count in the fourth quarter was 9% below Q4 2022. Our non-GAAP results exclude $276 million or expense in personnel related to a ruling in the Netherlands pension fund matter and $530 million of expense in G&A related to a draft decision by a Spanish Competition Authority. I\u2019d like to provide some perspective on each of these. As Glenn mentioned, we strongly disagree with the draft decision and unprecedented fine proposed by Spanish Competition Authority, which we plan to appeal if it becomes final. The appeal process could take a few years. During any appeal process, we would expect to influence some changes to our business practices in Spain, we do not currently undertake that these will have a significant impact on our business. Turning to the Dutch pension case. In January, the court of appeal in the ruled the most Booking.com employees in the Netherlands should enroll \u2013 in a travel industry-wide pension fund. The liability we recorded in our Q4 results is for prior periods related to this pension plan. We\u2019re working through how we align this travel industry-wide plan with the existing pension plan we offer to our employees in the Netherlands. We expect there will be some increase in our pension plan costs in the Netherlands going forward, but we do not expect these to be material. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $222 million in the quarter. When looking at the full year, we are pleased to report that our \u2013 2023 room nights grew 17% year-over-year, and our gross bookings grew 24% and about 25% on a constant currency basis. Our full year revenue was over $21 million, which was up 25% year-over-year and up similarly on a constant currency basis. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.2% in 2023, which is up slightly versus 14.1% in 2022. For the full year, there is more than 0.5 points of positive impact from timing as well the benefit to take rates from increased revenues associated with payments, but this was mostly offset by an increase in the mix of flights, an increase in Asia mix has really recovered and by our increased investments in merchandising. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. For the full year, our marketing plus merchandising at Booking.com as a percentage of gross bookings was 5.6%, down from 5.9% in 2022, driven by marketing efficiencies and direct mix. The 5.6% in 2023 is still up from 5.5% in 2019 and are leading into a recovered travel market more than offset gains due to increased direct mix. For the full year, the direct channel as a percentage of our room nights, continue to increase in mix. When we exclude our B2B or business-to-business, our direct mix was in the low 60% range for the year. Our full year EBITDA was more than $7 million and was up 34% year-over-year and up about 37% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33%, which was 12 percentage points higher than our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 and in-line with our expectations at the start of the year. Our full year non-GAAP earnings per share was about $152 a share, which is up 52% year and up about 58% on a constant currency basis. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance of $13.1 billion was down versus our Q3 ending balance of $14.3 billion due to the $2.4 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter partially offset by the $1.3 billion of free cash flow we generated in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we generated $7 billion in free cash flow. We repurchased over $10 billion worth of shares in 2023, taking our remaining repurchase authorization down to $14 billion and reducing our year-end share count by 9% versus 2022 and by 16% versus 2021, which is just before we restarted our share repurchase program. As we think about our capital structure and allocation framework going forward, we remain focused on appropriately investing in our business and growing returns for our shareholders while maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings. Given our confidence in our earnings power, strong free cash flow profile and our ability to consistently shareholders, we are announcing today that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $8.75 per share to complement our existing share repurchase program. The dividend is payable March 28, 2024 to shareholders record on March 8, 2024. We believe the introduction of a dividend will allow us to enhance our capital return program and further expand our base of investors. In terms of composition of capital returns, we expect the share repurchases will represent the vast majority of our total capital return to shareholders going forward. We continue to expect to complete the $24 billion share repurchase authorization we announced early 2023 within 4 years where we started, which would be before the end of 2026. We reiterate our previously stated gross leverage target 2x, and our goal to move to a 1x net leverage over time. The initiation of a dividend does not change our thinking around these targets. Now on to our thoughts for the first quarter of 2024. All growth rates are on a year-on-year basis. Given that we\u2019re now beyond the COVID period, when granular short-term information was helpful in assessing the path \u2013 we\u2019re returning to our historical guidance approach with outcome range for the full quarter ahead and less detail on monthly trends and individual P&L line items. Based on the solid travel demands we\u2019ve seen so far in the first quarter, we expect Q1 room night growth to be between 4% and 6%. We expect the ongoing war in the Middle East have a negative 1% impact on Q1 room night growth. We\u2019re also comparing with a strong start to the year in 2023 when we started to see an expansion of the booking window. January room night growth was above the high end of that range. As we move through the quarter, every room bank growth will benefit from an extra day, our March room night growth will be hurt by Easter being in March. We expect these to roughly offset each other. We expect Q1 gross bookings growth to be between 5% and 7%, about 1 percentage point faster than room night growth due to slightly higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and faster growth from flights, partially offset by about 1 percentage point of FX pressure. We expect Q1 revenue growth will be between 11% and 13%, faster than Q1 bookings growth due in part to the Easter shift, which we expect to bear the Q1 revenue by about 3 percentage points. We expect a similar native impact on revenue growth in Q2. We expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be between $680 million and $720 million, which at the midpoint would be 19% year-on-year growth and about a 1 percentage point increase in EBITDA margin. We expect EBITDA margin to bank from market expenses growing slower than revenue and growing similar to gross bookings, which we expect will more than offset our fixed OpEx growth growing slightly faster than revenue. As we set our course to the full year ahead, I want to first address our longer-term ambition for growth in our business. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, in a more normalized market environment, we\u2019re aiming to achieve constant currency growth rates for gross booking revenue and earnings per share that are higher than what we achieved in 2019. This would remain growing above 8% for each of the top line metrics and about 15% for earnings per share. We believe we\u2019ll be able to achieve these levels of growth, given the investments we made to build a stronger business and a better offering for our travelers and partners versus what we had 5 years ago. At recent FX rates, we expect changes in FX will negatively impact our reported growth rate by a little more than 1 percentage point. With that framework and with FX in mind, we expect to grow our full year 2024 slightly faster than 7% and including the assumption that the war in the Middle East will negatively impact our full year 2024 growth rate by 1%. We expect revenue for the year to grow at similar rate to our gross bookings growth. We expect a more fixed expense in 2024 to grow in the low to mid-teens. We are planning to leverage from these more fixed expenses in 2025. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA will grow slightly faster than revenue, largely due to expectations for an increased direct mix. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit less than a percentage point. Lastly, we expect EPS growth to be above 40%. In closing, we are pleased with our Q4 results, our Q1 outlook and our expectation in 2024 to grow faster than 2019 across gross bookings, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS with exceeding EBITDA margin year-over-year. We expect 2024 to be another strong year for us. We\u2019ll now move to Q&A. Sarah, will you please open the lines?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. One for David, and I guess this might be your last call, I would love to hear about your \u2013 who you are on CFO transition. But the guidance, is January growing above the 4% to 6% for room nights? I thought January might have tougher comps. So, maybe talk a little bit about the shape of the quarter. And then maybe bigger picture for Glenn. Just was wondering, you have so much data as the share leader in room nights. How do you think the AI transition could play out for booking? And do you think you have some advantages versus search engines or your peers? How you are thinking about that? Thank you.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, Justin thanks. Let me take the first one, and handover to Glenn for the second one. So, yes, as I have said in my remarks, just to reiterate, January is \u2013 did grow faster than the high end of the 4% to 6% range that we talked about. It did benefit, we believe, slightly maybe in the range of about 1% from the shift of Chinese New Year this year, which we expect to be offset in February. And as we said, we would expect therefore, February and March to have a lower growth rate, in January, essentially consistent with our prior guidance of expecting deceleration during the quarter.\nGlenn Fogel: Thanks Dave for that. And Justin, AI, obviously incredibly important subject for everybody in any business right now. And I think I talked about it at the last call and have been talking about it a lot whenever I speak about how important this is for anybody who is looking to the future to create something that could be transformational. We are very early, as I have said in the past. I like pointing out the things that we have done so far and some of the early signs we see that this is going to be just fantastic for us. Nobody knows how long it will take. One of the things I love is us being in a position because of our financial position, because of the number of people we have who have capabilities to look into this. Because of the data we have, as you pointed out, that people can then be able to use it to create models and use it in ways that are complementary to other people, are doing in terms of creating large language models and so on. I do believe we have an advantage because of our size and scale and the capabilities of our people to create something in all parts of the business, whether it would be, as I discussed, things that help the traveler, which are the sort of products there or helping us in the back part of our business, the back office and make these more efficient, going throughout. I think we do have an advantage, of course, we will see over time how well and how quickly we can actually translate that into better numbers in terms of margins, in terms of more people coming to us, people increasing loyalty, etcetera. But I am very encouraged with what I am seeing so far. And I certainly believe that we do have the full position here in the travel industry.\nDavid Goulden: Justin, just before we hand back to the operator for the next question. I just want to reiterate two other things I said about the Q1 room night guide. This is growth after the impact of about a point of hurt from the Middle East. And of course, we are comping against a very strong start to last year when we saw room nights of the booking window moving from a contracted position to an expanded position in the first quarter that also created some strong results in Q1 last year. So, you have to factor those things into account as well.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. And David, this is your last call. We will miss you. Thanks for all the work over the years.\nDavid Goulden: Thanks Justin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nKevin Kopelman: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about marketing. First, merchandising was only up slightly in the mix or only up slightly as a percentage of GBV, I should say, 2023. Do you feel that that\u2019s reached a steady state in the mix, or do you see incremental pushes this year in merchandising? And then on advertising, are you seeing any changes to the bidding environment?\nDavid Goulden: Okay. Yes. So Kevin, so we have now, I think as you characterize, we can ask here with our merchandising activities that\u2019s been something that we have been ramping up over time, Booking.com. And I think we now kind of deploy it in place in where we plan to deploy it. So, it has reached more of a state and new store, only a slight increase in merchandising in total from last year to this year as a percentage of GBV. So, when we kind of look at our model going forward, we do expect that across marketing merchandising with our continued increase in direct mix, that can be a source of leverage for us. And of course, as I mentioned in my commentary about the full year, that will be the biggest driver of our EBITDA margin expansion this year and will be joined by OpEx next year. And then relative to the competitive environment, it stays competitive. I mean these are very competitive markets. There are many players in there. I think people realize it\u2019s not just the OTAs, there are meta players, there are hotel players, there are chains you name it, a lot of people are bidding in these marketplaces. So, I think it just remains competitive, but we are pleased with how we are doing in a competitive marketplace.\nGlenn Fogel: And Kevin, just a reference back to Justin\u2019s question about AI and data and merchandising, how we do it, etcetera. One of the great things I really see about our position is that using data, using all things you know to merchandise smartly. Do it where we think it\u2019s going to give us an advantage and not do it where we are just giving away money. And I really see as all as AI technology develops further, as we begin to optimize over time, with all the different parts of the connected trip, we are going to be able to provide value to both the travelers and be able to get our suppliers to help provide merchandising opportunities and us doing an intelligent way. So, it\u2019s win for the traveler, win for the partner and us as the people are doing all this, we will also win.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks Glenn.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thanks. Two questions, please. In terms of your guidance for the full year on the margins side, what are you embedding in there in terms of marketing or sales and marketing spend and merchandising spend as a percentage of bookings? Are you assuming a little bit of leverage in there? And I am sorry if you covered that in your published comments, but if you could answer that. And then secondly, on the buybacks in Q3, I think they were a little \u2013 in Q4, I think they were a little bit lower than in Q3, was that your intention? Was there a particular reason why you maybe \u2013 may have been a little less active than the market in Q4? Thank you very much.\nDavid Goulden: Alright. Thank you, Mark. I will take those. So, as I have said in the prepared remarks, the biggest driver of leverage we expect this year on EBITDA margin going to be from our direct mix increase, which means that we will have a small sustain to the business, which has paid a higher percent of mix and therefore, we would expect to get some leverage on marketing and merchandise. We expect to continue to be aggressive and still lead into the markets where we are spending money on paid marketing and we don\u2019t necessarily \u2013 we are offsetting anything about our ROI on that to tip any hand, but we would expect that it would be the direct mix increase. It will be the driver of leverage in marketing and merchandising therefore would be the driver of improvement in our EBITDA margins. On the buybacks in Q4, I think they are roughly same in size to Q3. At the start of Q4, where share price was lower, we said if the share price stays at a lower level, we will buy more in Q4 than we did in Q3. Share price moved up during the quarter, and we take share price into account when thinking about the level of buybacks and of course we have taken the long-term view. But in the short-term, we do moderate based upon how share price moves. So, that\u2019s perhaps why it\u2019s being a little bit less than you may have expected. A little bit less than we perhaps indicated on the last earnings call, but still a big number and still over $10 billion for the year as you see a significant reduction in our share count\u2026\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, David. It makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow-up on the full year outlook. I mean it sounds like you are very confident in the business overall. Just does the full year outlook reflect just normalization of trends in \u201824? The tough comp and the Middle East impact that you mentioned, is there anything else to consider here? Thanks.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. I think there is a couple of things to bear in mind in the full year outlook. Bear in mind, we talked about our framework. So, we said that we would grow faster than 8 and 8.15 on a constant currency basis. And we are saying we are going to do that with the impact of the Middle East on slowing our business down. So, I think that is a positive outlook. Of course, we have adjusted the numbers to a reported number. So, when you include the FX shift at current rates of roughly 1%, then the 8, 8.15 becomes 7, 7.4. But again, it\u2019s essentially 8, 8.15 on a constant currency basis, and we expect to be higher than that even with roughly a point of hurt to the business on the top line and the bottom line from what\u2019s happening in the Middle East. So, it\u2019s consistent with our framework and I believe is confident of our position of the travel market and our continued ability to gain share in travel.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions guys. I have two sort of on the U.S. The first one, when you talk about the U.S. being flat, does that include alternative accommodations? So, is the hotel business in the U.S. actually declining then? That\u2019s the first one. And then just sort of, Glenn, as you look into 2024, what are the investments you have to make in the U.S., both on the hotel side as well as the alternative accommodation side to sort of drive more and more durable, consistent growth from here?\nDavid Goulden: Yes. I will start with the first one, back to Glenn, the second one. So, U.S. was flat for the quarter, but bear in mind, it was down in October. And October, it was driven very much by the kind of ripple shock effect of the \u2013 what was happening in the Middle East. So, therefore it was back into growth mode in November and December in order to put our plant for the quarter. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into a whole quarter that you have got to kind of look what happened in October. Yes, that doesn\u2019t call alternatives. As Glenn said, alternative grew very nicely in the U.S., but it\u2019s a much lower mix of our business in the U.S. than it is in other parts of the world. So, again, I wouldn\u2019t go too much into assuming that means that hotels are\u2026\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. And regarding \u2013 the question regarding how we are going to do even better in the U.S., we have talked about the numbers that we have shown so far. I am very pleased you look back to 2019, see what our steer was, that what numbers we then look at them now, it goes really fantastic growth and great work by the team. I think last quarter, I had out to the team then and I will do it again because they are doing fantastic work. One of the things is because the under-indexed, because we are smaller in terms of not clear [ph] of the U.S. versus other parts, this is a great opportunity for us. And I have talked about we have to continue to improve our product particularly in the alternative accommodation on account of that, and we have been doing that. And that\u2019s why we have this large growth rate in the U.S. alternative accommodations. Very pleased to see that happening. They continue to provide to our hotel partners what they need and what they want is incremental demand. They don\u2019t want us to be a provider to manage they think they can always get. And one of the great things about our team is working closely with our hotel partners. As you know, a lot of the U.S. is large chains, and we have developed, I think a very good relation with them to work together to help them, do what they need to do to achieve their results and us being a provider of those services and getting what we need, which is more bookings. I am pleased with the results we have done so far. And I think we have got a great opportunity to continue to do so for a long time.\nBrian Nowak: Thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nJames Lee: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Two here, I think Glenn, you talked about maybe increasing supply of home accommodation \u2013 alternative accommodation in the U.S. Can you elaborate, maybe talk about that plan a little bit, help us understand your strategy there. And also secondly, I think you guys talked about maybe on the loyalty program to include all verticals in 2024 would be great, you provide some details there as well. Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Thanks James. And I didn\u2019t quite get the second one. Let\u2019s start with the first one, maybe in front of the second one. So, it\u2019s interesting because in our last call, I went into a little bit about what do we need to do to increase that supply of alternative combinations. And I talked a little bit \u2013 and this is that high, it wasn\u2019t the first time I talked about this. Where we have \u2013 while we are even into urban and rural and such, I have talked in the past, though, how we don\u2019t have as many of the single properties that perhaps some of our competitors have less area down the road. But the whole idea is we want to do things efficiently and want do things effectively, which means it goes through the things where you can get larger groups of properties listing quicker by going to the big property managers who have a lot of them. That may be that you are going to end up with more things that are not with single home properties. But then after we have that enough, and that\u2019s the low-hanging fruit after we got that comes, then we got to go on and start getting more of the single homes, etcetera. And I have expressed my own disappointment that when I look for a single property sometimes I have mentioned, at one point on the call about wanting to get something out in the Hampton and New York for the summer and not seeing enough properties for us. There is lots of opportunity. But I look at this as an opportunity, not as a negative, but then you look how well we are doing, even though there is all the other stuff to go out and get. That\u2019s the way I feel about it, and I am pleased the way the team is going out. Look, 12% increase in our listings or $6.6 million, now over $7.4 million, I like the fact that we are increasing those numbers, doing it in a nice size and also particularly really like the fact that our growth rate of return on the combination was significantly higher than some other people in our space. So, I was very happy to see that. I didn\u2019t catch the second part of James\u2019 question.\nJames Lee: Yes, of course. The second part of the question is about your loyalty program Genius. I think Glenn you had mentioned you want to include all travel verticals into the program this year. And I was wondering if you can provide some details on that.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. Okay. So, what I would said is we are going to experiment. And we really see, we always want to experiment, where do things work, where do we see return for it, where do we see how this is working so well. So, we are going to continue to experiment and we do have, for example, rental cars well established into our Genius program. Obviously, our combination as well and we are going to experiment with all the different verticals. And the thing, is there a way to do in flights, is there a way to do it in track and how do we do it in terms of potentially even insurance, in all sorts of ways, our ride business when people need a ride from the airport to the hotel or hotel to the airport or from their home to the airport. Again, and this goes back to the first question, I think it was Justin asked about AI and about how you use data. And that\u2019s kind of one of the key things is when you have these models, and you can figure out what the best way to provide a benefit, and that\u2019s through our loyalty Genius program, that\u2019s doing that in a way that it provides value to the traveler, that\u2019s where they use us, that\u2019s why they come back to us. That\u2019s why they come to us direct. Maybe they will use the app because it\u2019s so simple to do it. At the same time, Genus is primarily almost right now, primarily being funded by our partners because they see value in that. They see value in providing a discount or some other type of benefit that we put into the offering, so that the travelers will book, that supplier what they want to sell. And doing to get it in a scientific way in doing it in a way that is going to make sure that we are not leaving value out of the cycle in a way that\u2019s not going to be beneficial to our supplier partners, doing it smartly, that\u2019s the thing that I love. And that\u2019s why we are going to continue to experiment on that. And I think it\u2019s worked so well in hotels and I think it\u2019s in a combination, alternative accommodations, I think this is going to work great in all of it. But we will see after we expand it.\nJames Lee: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much. Maybe following up on that last question from James, you talked earlier about connected trip and feeling optimistic about attach rates there, but still work to do. When you think about what you are trying to accomplish with Connected Trip longer term and you think about rising conversion, reducing friction. What do you put it down to? Is it consumer education? Is it supply? How should we be thinking about the building blocks behind connected trip to accomplish your longer term goals? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: So, if the question was really how do we get from here early stage showing good signs, but it\u2019s still small to scale and really showing the bottom line and top line and a loyalty and all those things, I think that \u2013 is that the question really?\nEric Sheridan: It is Glenn. Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So, look, one of the things that we have to \u2013 and I have said this is a long-term path. And the first thing was we had to build the verticals to begin with. One of the fun things was to mention that we started Booking.com we got off the ground in 2019 and now put all our flight numbers together, you see 400% increase there that\u2019s included, of course, Priceline had placed before that, where you just see the growth rate of flights right now, great. So, we got that vertical up and we got excellences up and attract is still early, but up. But these things \u2013 all of these things are the car rental was up, but we still do on that and of course the rides business and others. All of these things are at different levels of development, but still relatively new. And one of that, then we have to build all the modeling, all the ways to figure out what\u2019s the best way to offer one versus the other, and make sure that we are doing it the right way. And then it\u2019s working with our partner suppliers to provide us and prove out to them that this is worthwhile to them. All of these things take time. But I do like to say, we are seeing those signals. We are seeing the numbers. It is early and I am not going to do \u2013 I am sure you would like me to give you some numbers, say, here is what it\u2019s going to be tomorrow. Here is what the next milestone. I am going to do that. And I can\u2019t say I see we are on the right path.\nEric Sheridan: Great. Thank you. And thank you for everything David, congrats on the last call and good luck for everything.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions. I will turn the call to Glenn for closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. So, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, our shareholders. And as mentioned by a couple of people on the call, I have to give out a very special thank you to my very good friend and colleague, David Goulden. As you know, after 24 earnings calls as Booking Holdings CFO, he is retiring from this role and will be working on other areas of the business going forward. We greatly appreciate everything that David has done for this company, and we greatly appreciate everyone else\u2019s support as well as we continue to build on the long-term vision of our company. Thank you very much and good night.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our results for the fourth quarter and provide some color on the trends we see in the first quarter and \u2013 on 2024. All growth rates are on a year-on-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. One housekeeping item before discussing our results. We have reclassified digital services taxes into sales and other expenses and out of G&A expense. Due to the highly variable nature of GSTs, which are tied to the revenue earned in the countries where GST are enacted. We have provided a table with two areas of updated quarterly financials in our earnings press release that reflects this chain P&L geography, and all of my comments on this call will also reflect the change. Now on to our quarter results. Our room nights in the fourth quarter grew 9% year-over-year and 21% versus 2019, which was slightly better than our expectations of about 9% and 20%. Excluding Israel, Q4 room rights were up 11% versus 2022 and 22% versus 2019. Looking at our year-over-year room nights by region in the fourth quarter, Asia was up mid-teens Europe was up low double digits, Rest of World was up low single digits, and the U.S. was flat. All regions improved from October. The average booking window of Booking.com expanded in Q4 versus the same period in both 2022 and 2019, but was a bit less expanded than it was in the third quarter.  In Q4, mobile app mix of about 53% was about 5 percentage points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the fourth quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2022. The international mix of our room nights in Q4 was 50%, up from about 48% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and reaching about the same level as the pre-pandemic Q4 mix. Our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was slightly higher than Q4 2022, impacted by the war in the Middle East. As we expected, the higher overall cancellation in October normalized by the end of the quarter. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q4 room night growth was 19% year-over-year, and the global mix of alternative body room nights was about 32%, which was up versus about 29% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Q4 gross bookings increased 16% year-over-year or about 15% on a constant currency basis, which was ahead of our expectations. The 16% increase in gross bookings was 7 percentage points higher than the 9% room night growth due to about 4% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, plus over 1 percentage point of positive impact from each of FX movements and flight bookings. Our year-over-year ADR growth was natively impacted by regional mix due to higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 5 percentage points year-over-year. Despite higher ADRs in the fourth quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in the length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch the dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up about 46% year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 18% year-over-year or about 17% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.1%, which was about in line with our expectations. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 9% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 30 basis points lower than Q4 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of business. Performance margin ROIs increased year-over-year, helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q4 was about 15 basis points lower than last year, which was better than our expectation due to lower merchandising expense, higher direct mix and better performance marketing ROIs. Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 20 basis points compared with last year and also about 20 basis points above our expectation normalize for the DST reclassification, due in large parts to higher accounts receivable provisions related to our decision to delay some collections during the partner payment issue we discussed last quarter. We do not expect this to be an ongoing issue. More fixed expenses in aggregate were up 21% year-over-year, which was below our expectations primarily due to lower personnel and IT expense as well as due to the DST reclassification. 21% is calculated usually on non-GAAP expenses in both Q4 2023 and Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA of almost $1.5 billion was ahead of our expectation and was up 18% year-over-year and would have been about 22% on a constant currency basis. Separately, Q4 adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by a $37 million loss recorded in other income related to the devaluation of the Argentinian peso, which is not factored into our prior guidance. This reduced Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin by almost 1%. Non-GAAP net income of $1.1 billion resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $32 a share, which was up 29% year-over-year. Our average share count in the fourth quarter was 9% below Q4 2022. Our non-GAAP results exclude $276 million or expense in personnel related to a ruling in the Netherlands pension fund matter and $530 million of expense in G&A related to a draft decision by a Spanish Competition Authority. I'd like to provide some perspective on each of these. As Glenn mentioned, we strongly disagree with the draft decision and unprecedented fine proposed by Spanish Competition Authority, which we plan to appeal if it becomes final. The appeal process could take a few years. During any appeal process, we would expect to influence some changes to our business practices in Spain, we do not currently undertake that these will have a significant impact on our business. Turning to the Dutch pension case. In January, the court of appeal in the ruled the most Booking.com employees in the Netherlands should enroll \u2013 in a travel industry-wide pension fund. The liability we recorded in our Q4 results is for prior periods related to this pension plan. We're working through how we align this travel industry-wide plan with the existing pension plan we offer to our employees in the Netherlands. We expect there will be some increase in our pension plan costs in the Netherlands going forward, but we do not expect these to be material. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $222 million in the quarter. When looking at the full year, we are pleased to report that our \u2013 2023 room nights grew 17% year-over-year, and our gross bookings grew 24% and about 25% on a constant currency basis. Our full year revenue was over $21 million, which was up 25% year-over-year and up similarly on a constant currency basis. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.2% in 2023, which is up slightly versus 14.1% in 2022. For the full year, there is more than 0.5 points of positive impact from timing as well the benefit to take rates from increased revenues associated with payments, but this was mostly offset by an increase in the mix of flights, an increase in Asia mix has really recovered and by our increased investments in merchandising. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. For the full year, our marketing plus merchandising at Booking.com as a percentage of gross bookings was 5.6%, down from 5.9% in 2022, driven by marketing efficiencies and direct mix. The 5.6% in 2023 is still up from 5.5% in 2019 and are leading into a recovered travel market more than offset gains due to increased direct mix. For the full year, the direct channel as a percentage of our room nights, continue to increase in mix. When we exclude our B2B or business-to-business, our direct mix was in the low 60% range for the year. Our full year EBITDA was more than $7 million and was up 34% year-over-year and up about 37% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33%, which was 12 percentage points higher than our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 and in-line with our expectations at the start of the year. Our full year non-GAAP earnings per share was about $152 a share, which is up 52% year and up about 58% on a constant currency basis. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance of $13.1 billion was down versus our Q3 ending balance of $14.3 billion due to the $2.4 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter partially offset by the $1.3 billion of free cash flow we generated in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we generated $7 billion in free cash flow. We repurchased over $10 billion worth of shares in 2023, taking our remaining repurchase authorization down to $14 billion and reducing our year-end share count by 9% versus 2022 and by 16% versus 2021, which is just before we restarted our share repurchase program. As we think about our capital structure and allocation framework going forward, we remain focused on appropriately investing in our business and growing returns for our shareholders while maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings. Given our confidence in our earnings power, strong free cash flow profile and our ability to consistently shareholders, we are announcing today that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $8.75 per share to complement our existing share repurchase program. The dividend is payable March 28, 2024 to shareholders record on March 8, 2024. We believe the introduction of a dividend will allow us to enhance our capital return program and further expand our base of investors. In terms of composition of capital returns, we expect the share repurchases will represent the vast majority of our total capital return to shareholders going forward. We continue to expect to complete the $24 billion share repurchase authorization we announced early 2023 within 4 years where we started, which would be before the end of 2026. We reiterate our previously stated gross leverage target 2x, and our goal to move to a 1x net leverage over time. The initiation of a dividend does not change our thinking around these targets. Now on to our thoughts for the first quarter of 2024. All growth rates are on a year-on-year basis. Given that we're now beyond the COVID period, when granular short-term information was helpful in assessing the path \u2013 we're returning to our historical guidance approach with outcome range for the full quarter ahead and less detail on monthly trends and individual P&L line items. Based on the solid travel demands we've seen so far in the first quarter, we expect Q1 room night growth to be between 4% and 6%. We expect the ongoing war in the Middle East have a negative 1% impact on Q1 room night growth. We're also comparing with a strong start to the year in 2023 when we started to see an expansion of the booking window. January room night growth was above the high end of that range. As we move through the quarter, every room bank growth will benefit from an extra day, our March room night growth will be hurt by Easter being in March. We expect these to roughly offset each other. We expect Q1 gross bookings growth to be between 5% and 7%, about 1 percentage point faster than room night growth due to slightly higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and faster growth from flights, partially offset by about 1 percentage point of FX pressure. We expect Q1 revenue growth will be between 11% and 13%, faster than Q1 bookings growth due in part to the Easter shift, which we expect to bear the Q1 revenue by about 3 percentage points. We expect a similar native impact on revenue growth in Q2. We expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be between $680 million and $720 million, which at the midpoint would be 19% year-on-year growth and about a 1 percentage point increase in EBITDA margin. We expect EBITDA margin to bank from market expenses growing slower than revenue and growing similar to gross bookings, which we expect will more than offset our fixed OpEx growth growing slightly faster than revenue. As we set our course to the full year ahead, I want to first address our longer-term ambition for growth in our business. As we've discussed previously, in a more normalized market environment, we're aiming to achieve constant currency growth rates for gross booking revenue and earnings per share that are higher than what we achieved in 2019. This would remain growing above 8% for each of the top line metrics and about 15% for earnings per share. We believe we'll be able to achieve these levels of growth, given the investments we made to build a stronger business and a better offering for our travelers and partners versus what we had 5 years ago. At recent FX rates, we expect changes in FX will negatively impact our reported growth rate by a little more than 1 percentage point. With that framework and with FX in mind, we expect to grow our full year 2024 slightly faster than 7% and including the assumption that the war in the Middle East will negatively impact our full year 2024 growth rate by 1%. We expect revenue for the year to grow at similar rate to our gross bookings growth. We expect a more fixed expense in 2024 to grow in the low to mid-teens. We are planning to leverage from these more fixed expenses in 2025. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA will grow slightly faster than revenue, largely due to expectations for an increased direct mix. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit less than a percentage point. Lastly, we expect EPS growth to be above 40%. In closing, we are pleased with our Q4 results, our Q1 outlook and our expectation in 2024 to grow faster than 2019 across gross bookings, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS with exceeding EBITDA margin year-over-year. We expect 2024 to be another strong year for us. We'll now move to Q&A. Sarah, will you please open the lines? Yes, Justin thanks. Let me take the first one, and handover to Glenn for the second one. So, yes, as I have said in my remarks, just to reiterate, January is \u2013 did grow faster than the high end of the 4% to 6% range that we talked about. It did benefit, we believe, slightly maybe in the range of about 1% from the shift of Chinese New Year this year, which we expect to be offset in February. And as we said, we would expect therefore, February and March to have a lower growth rate, in January, essentially consistent with our prior guidance of expecting deceleration during the quarter. Justin, just before we hand back to the operator for the next question. I just want to reiterate two other things I said about the Q1 room night guide. This is growth after the impact of about a point of hurt from the Middle East. And of course, we are comping against a very strong start to last year when we saw room nights of the booking window moving from a contracted position to an expanded position in the first quarter that also created some strong results in Q1 last year. So, you have to factor those things into account as well. Thanks Justin. Okay. Yes. So Kevin, so we have now, I think as you characterize, we can ask here with our merchandising activities that's been something that we have been ramping up over time, Booking.com. And I think we now kind of deploy it in place in where we plan to deploy it. So, it has reached more of a state and new store, only a slight increase in merchandising in total from last year to this year as a percentage of GBV. So, when we kind of look at our model going forward, we do expect that across marketing merchandising with our continued increase in direct mix, that can be a source of leverage for us. And of course, as I mentioned in my commentary about the full year, that will be the biggest driver of our EBITDA margin expansion this year and will be joined by OpEx next year. And then relative to the competitive environment, it stays competitive. I mean these are very competitive markets. There are many players in there. I think people realize it's not just the OTAs, there are meta players, there are hotel players, there are chains you name it, a lot of people are bidding in these marketplaces. So, I think it just remains competitive, but we are pleased with how we are doing in a competitive marketplace. Alright. Thank you, Mark. I will take those. So, as I have said in the prepared remarks, the biggest driver of leverage we expect this year on EBITDA margin going to be from our direct mix increase, which means that we will have a small sustain to the business, which has paid a higher percent of mix and therefore, we would expect to get some leverage on marketing and merchandise. We expect to continue to be aggressive and still lead into the markets where we are spending money on paid marketing and we don't necessarily \u2013 we are offsetting anything about our ROI on that to tip any hand, but we would expect that it would be the direct mix increase. It will be the driver of leverage in marketing and merchandising therefore would be the driver of improvement in our EBITDA margins. On the buybacks in Q4, I think they are roughly same in size to Q3. At the start of Q4, where share price was lower, we said if the share price stays at a lower level, we will buy more in Q4 than we did in Q3. Share price moved up during the quarter, and we take share price into account when thinking about the level of buybacks and of course we have taken the long-term view. But in the short-term, we do moderate based upon how share price moves. So, that's perhaps why it's being a little bit less than you may have expected. A little bit less than we perhaps indicated on the last earnings call, but still a big number and still over $10 billion for the year as you see a significant reduction in our share count... Yes. I think there is a couple of things to bear in mind in the full year outlook. Bear in mind, we talked about our framework. So, we said that we would grow faster than 8 and 8.15 on a constant currency basis. And we are saying we are going to do that with the impact of the Middle East on slowing our business down. So, I think that is a positive outlook. Of course, we have adjusted the numbers to a reported number. So, when you include the FX shift at current rates of roughly 1%, then the 8, 8.15 becomes 7, 7.4. But again, it's essentially 8, 8.15 on a constant currency basis, and we expect to be higher than that even with roughly a point of hurt to the business on the top line and the bottom line from what's happening in the Middle East. So, it's consistent with our framework and I believe is confident of our position of the travel market and our continued ability to gain share in travel. Yes. I will start with the first one, back to Glenn, the second one. So, U.S. was flat for the quarter, but bear in mind, it was down in October. And October, it was driven very much by the kind of ripple shock effect of the \u2013 what was happening in the Middle East. So, therefore it was back into growth mode in November and December in order to put our plant for the quarter. So, I wouldn't read too much into a whole quarter that you have got to kind of look what happened in October. Yes, that doesn't call alternatives. As Glenn said, alternative grew very nicely in the U.S., but it's a much lower mix of our business in the U.S. than it is in other parts of the world. So, again, I wouldn't go too much into assuming that means that hotels are... Thank you, Eric."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' fourth quarter conference call. I am joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report a solid finish to 2023 as fourth quarter room nights slightly exceeded our expectations and grew a bit more than 9% year-over-year or 11% when excludes Israel from both periods. When compared to 2019, our room nights grew 21% versus our expectations of 20%. We delivered record fourth quarter revenue of $4.8 billion and record adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which were ahead of our expectations. Finally, the GAAP and earnings per share in the quarter grew 29% year-over-year, helped by the reduction in our share count versus last year. At the start of 2024, we continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand. As we look to the year ahead, we see strong growth on the books for travel that's scheduled to take place in 2024, which gives early indications of potentially another record summer travel season. As we've noted previously, a high percentage of these bookings are capable and what is on the books today for the summer period represents a small percentage of the total bookings that we expect to ultimately receive. David will provide further details on fourth quarter results and on our thoughts about the first quarter and full year 2024. Looking back at the full year of 2023, I am proud of our efforts to drive more benefits to our travelers and supply partners while also delivering record-setting industry-leading financial results. We reached a significant milestone last year with our customers' booking an all-time high of over 1 billion room nights on our platform, which was an increase of 17% versus 2022. Gross bookings of $151 billion increased 24% versus 2022. In 2023, we reached a new revenue record of over $21 billion, which was 25% higher than 2022. We achieved this strong top line result while improving our profitability with record adjusted EBITDA of $7.1 billion, an increase of 34% versus 2022, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by over 2 percentage points year-over-year. Our non-GAAP earnings per share of about $152 increased 52% year-over-year and was 48% higher than our prior full year all-time high back in 2019. Across all of our key metrics in 2023, we were a meaningfully larger and faster-growing business than we were in 2019. Our ambition going forward in a normalized growth in market for the travel industry is to continue to grow our gross bookings, revenue and earnings per share faster than we did in 2019. We are confident we will achieve these objectives because we've invested in building a stronger business and better product offerings for our travelers and partners that we had back then. We can see this in many areas, but I will highlight a few examples of where we have strengthened our offering relative to 2019. We now have a scaled up merchant platform at Booking.com, which processed first half of Booking.com's gross bookings in 2023. Our merchant offering brings many benefits to our travelers and partners as well as new strategic benefits to us, including the ability to merchandise. We have continued to scale up our offering at Booking.com since in 2019, with total company air tickets booked in 2023 up more than 400% over that time frame, primarily driven by Booking.com. We see this vertical bring new customers to our platform while delivering a more complete offering to our existing customers making travel planning and booking easier for them and creating opportunities to provide more value to them. On alternative accommodations, we continue to increase the mix of our alternative accommodations room nights, which treats 33% of Booking.com's room rights in 2023 as we improve our product offering and increase our supply choices with further opportunities ahead, particularly in the U.S. Early, we are pleased that for Booking.com, we have created foundations necessary to offer insurance, attractions and ground transportation options and expect these offerings to add value to our connected trip vision. On marketing, we've improved our abilities in using performance marketing channels even more effectively and are now better focused on our brand spending. On loyalty, we've expanded and enhanced our loyalty program, Booking.com to deliver more benefits to more of our traveler customers with more of our property and rental car partners participating. And lastly, we are continuing to strengthen the direct relationship with our travelers as our mobile app room nights and total direct room nights continue to increase in our mix. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry, which we believe will grow faster than GDP growth across our core markets. With that foundation of industry growth and the improvements we've made to strengthen our offerings, we are positive about our future and believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years. With our long-term positive outlook, solid financial performance and strong balance sheet, we returned over $10 billion to shareholders during 2023 by repurchasing our shares. Returning capital to shareholders will remain a high priority for the company going forward. And today, we are taking another important step in that journey by announcing that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend to complement our existing share repurchase program. David will provide further thoughts on our approach to capital returns in his remarks. In addition to our strong financial results in 2023, we made meaningful progress against our key strategic priorities, which include: advancing our connected trip vision, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, supporting our supply partners and growing alternative accommodations and building more direct relationships with our traveler customers. Let me address the progress we have made in each of these areas. On the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make planning, booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. We believe this is important because we know the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented and frustrating to travelers than it should be. The contribution aims to greatly improve that experience for consumers which we believe will drive further differentiation of our offerings and lead to improved loyalty, increase direct bookings, higher frequency and a greater share of total travel spend on our platform over time. This is good not only for our travelers, but also for our partner suppliers who will be able to utilize different elements of the connected trip to obtain additional business in an efficient and lower cost way. As we continue to make progress in developing the connected trip, you will see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform that moves us closer to this long-term vision. This approach allows us to realize benefits while we are building towards that future state. In fact, some of the key improvements to our platform over the last few years that I spoke about earlier were driven by our work on the connected trip. For example, our emerging platform at Booking.com is a foundational base to the connected trip, and it helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience for our travelers. Plus, it enables us to smartly merchandise a variety of partner and self-supply offers when appropriate. Another example would be the development of flights on Booking.com, with flights being one of the most important elements of travel outside of accommodations. In 2023, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 58% year-over-year driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com site offering. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers to Booking.com through the flight vertical, and are encouraged by the right that these customers book other services on our platform. Outside of flights and accommodations, we need solid progress in expanding the breadth of our attraction supply that is available to our travelers. While we do not expect attractions to be a major financial contributor on its own, we see benefits from a strong attractions offering given the potential bundling opportunities as we will see ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination. Overall, we believe we have made great progress in building toward our Connected revision and we are starting to see early signs of the benefits. We continue to see a growing percentage of transactions, which we count as connectors though these are still a small percentage of our total transactions today. Importantly, we see these types of customers returning to us more frequently, and we point to experiment with expanding Genius program to include all travel verticals in 2024, which we expect will drive more value to travelers across the different elements of the connected trip. We plan to continue to build out our Connected Trip vision, which we believe will result in increased travel and supplier engagement with our platform. In order to achieve the easier and more personalized experience of the Connected Trip, we have always envisioned AI technology playing a central role. Over the last few quarters, I have discussed the hard work our teams have been doing to integrate generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Booking.com's AI trip planner and Priceline's generative AI travels \u2013 named Penny. After launching Booking.com's AI trip planner in the U.S. last summer, we expanded the rollout to the UK market in the fourth quarter. At this early stage, the team remains focused. I learn more about customers who want to interact with the tool and what types of questions they will ask. We see the AI trip planner is getting better answering customers' inquiries and we are excited to start testing other verticals out of accommodations. At Priceline, last week, they announced their weaker product release, which included several enhancements to Penny following 6 months of real-world interaction with users that resulted in valuable learnings from the Priceline team. Priceline's AI travel assisted product can now help travelers be on just the hotel category as it now covers flights, car rentals and vacation packages. While was nicely launched at the end of the booking funnel on the checkout page, it is now available on the Priceline homepage where it can help with travel planning, booking and modifying a trip as we booked. This is a clear example of how our teams iterate and enhance our AI-powered products as we learn more through user interactions. We continue to see encouraging signs that Priceline's Penny product helps lower customer service contact across travel verticals, and we believe, improves the customer experience. Beyond improving customer service contact rates, we believe that, over time, we can leverage generative AI technology to help make our customer service agents more efficient across our entire Outside of customer service, we continue to explore areas where we believe we can use generative AI tools to increase productivity. We have early indications that using generative AI enhances the productivity of our software developers and are encouraged by the results so far. We look forward to experimenting with these and other ways Gen AI tools might make our business more efficient in the future. Turning to our supply partners. We strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform. And we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental bookings and developing products and features to help support their businesses. The majority of our partners are small independent businesses, and we are pleased to see many are reporting significantly improved business performance over the last year. We believe that helping our smaller partners thrive contributes to the long-term diversity and sustainability of our sector. One area in which we work with many small independent businesses is through our alternative combination offering comp. This is an area which we have continued to strengthen our business, increasing supply and raising product awareness on many travelers. Also combination room nights grew 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 24% for the full year, which was faster our traditional hotel category. We saw meaningfully higher growth in our U.S. alternative accommodation room nights, though this is all a relatively small Globally, alternative accommodations represented about 33% of Booking.com's total room nights in 2023, which was 3 percentage points higher than in 2022. Our strong trend of accommodation room nights growth is benefiting from having more listings available on our platform were travelers to choose from. We are seeing continued momentum in annual turn combination supply both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about 7.4 million by the end of 2023, which is about 12% higher than the 6.6 million last year. We're focused on continuing to build on this progress by further improving the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increasing loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. I am encouraged that in 2023 at Booking.com, we had strong growth in our base of our peak bookers, demonstrating strong retention, while we're also pleased with the increase in the number of new users to our platform versus 2022. We're also strengthening the direct relationship with our travelers as our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continues to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter and when measured for the full year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. Our mix overnight through our mobile apps increased year-over-year by about 5 percentage points for the full year to 49%. Booking.com remained the number one downloaded travel app in the world in 2023. In Asia, Booking.com and Agoda are top five travel apps. And in the U.S. Booking.com, Priceline and OpenTable are all in the top 10 travel apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. Finally, I want to briefly address a regulatory matter that's impacting the financial results we are reporting today. The Spanish Competition Authority has issued a draft decision alleging infringement by Booking.com of Spanish competition law and then intends to issue a fine of $530 million. We could not disagree more with this draft decision and the arbitrarily large fine that they imposed, which is completely disproportionate to the alleged conduct. If the draft decision were to become fine, we plan to appeal. The success of our business is built on a mutually beneficial and balanced partnership with our millions of hotels and other accommodation partners around the world. We provide exceptional choice, value and service for travelers and we provide a marketplace for hotels and other partners that allows them to attract travelers from around the world at lower cost than many other marketing channels. We have a clear track record of cooperating with many competition and consumer authorities to find amicable and workable solutions to their concerns, including working with the year being commission on the Digital Markets Act. As we have previously disclosed, we plan to file our notification for designation under the DMA suit. And we believe the main concerns raised by the Spanish Authority overlap with the DMA. We will continue to work closely with these regulatory bodies to maintain consistent rules. And most importantly, we will continue to ensure that we are offering the best possible platform to our partners and our customers. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong fourth quarter results and the continued of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well over the long-term. We continue our work to deliver a better offering experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We are confident in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. Thanks Dave for that. And Justin, AI, obviously incredibly important subject for everybody in any business right now. And I think I talked about it at the last call and have been talking about it a lot whenever I speak about how important this is for anybody who is looking to the future to create something that could be transformational. We are very early, as I have said in the past. I like pointing out the things that we have done so far and some of the early signs we see that this is going to be just fantastic for us. Nobody knows how long it will take. One of the things I love is us being in a position because of our financial position, because of the number of people we have who have capabilities to look into this. Because of the data we have, as you pointed out, that people can then be able to use it to create models and use it in ways that are complementary to other people, are doing in terms of creating large language models and so on. I do believe we have an advantage because of our size and scale and the capabilities of our people to create something in all parts of the business, whether it would be, as I discussed, things that help the traveler, which are the sort of products there or helping us in the back part of our business, the back office and make these more efficient, going throughout. I think we do have an advantage, of course, we will see over time how well and how quickly we can actually translate that into better numbers in terms of margins, in terms of more people coming to us, people increasing loyalty, etcetera. But I am very encouraged with what I am seeing so far. And I certainly believe that we do have the full position here in the travel industry. And Kevin, just a reference back to Justin's question about AI and data and merchandising, how we do it, etcetera. One of the great things I really see about our position is that using data, using all things you know to merchandise smartly. Do it where we think it's going to give us an advantage and not do it where we are just giving away money. And I really see as all as AI technology develops further, as we begin to optimize over time, with all the different parts of the connected trip, we are going to be able to provide value to both the travelers and be able to get our suppliers to help provide merchandising opportunities and us doing an intelligent way. So, it's win for the traveler, win for the partner and us as the people are doing all this, we will also win. Yes. And regarding \u2013 the question regarding how we are going to do even better in the U.S., we have talked about the numbers that we have shown so far. I am very pleased you look back to 2019, see what our steer was, that what numbers we then look at them now, it goes really fantastic growth and great work by the team. I think last quarter, I had out to the team then and I will do it again because they are doing fantastic work. One of the things is because the under-indexed, because we are smaller in terms of not clear [ph] of the U.S. versus other parts, this is a great opportunity for us. And I have talked about we have to continue to improve our product particularly in the alternative accommodation on account of that, and we have been doing that. And that's why we have this large growth rate in the U.S. alternative accommodations. Very pleased to see that happening. They continue to provide to our hotel partners what they need and what they want is incremental demand. They don't want us to be a provider to manage they think they can always get. And one of the great things about our team is working closely with our hotel partners. As you know, a lot of the U.S. is large chains, and we have developed, I think a very good relation with them to work together to help them, do what they need to do to achieve their results and us being a provider of those services and getting what we need, which is more bookings. I am pleased with the results we have done so far. And I think we have got a great opportunity to continue to do so for a long time. Thanks James. And I didn't quite get the second one. Let's start with the first one, maybe in front of the second one. So, it's interesting because in our last call, I went into a little bit about what do we need to do to increase that supply of alternative combinations. And I talked a little bit \u2013 and this is that high, it wasn't the first time I talked about this. Where we have \u2013 while we are even into urban and rural and such, I have talked in the past, though, how we don't have as many of the single properties that perhaps some of our competitors have less area down the road. But the whole idea is we want to do things efficiently and want do things effectively, which means it goes through the things where you can get larger groups of properties listing quicker by going to the big property managers who have a lot of them. That may be that you are going to end up with more things that are not with single home properties. But then after we have that enough, and that's the low-hanging fruit after we got that comes, then we got to go on and start getting more of the single homes, etcetera. And I have expressed my own disappointment that when I look for a single property sometimes I have mentioned, at one point on the call about wanting to get something out in the Hampton and New York for the summer and not seeing enough properties for us. There is lots of opportunity. But I look at this as an opportunity, not as a negative, but then you look how well we are doing, even though there is all the other stuff to go out and get. That's the way I feel about it, and I am pleased the way the team is going out. Look, 12% increase in our listings or $6.6 million, now over $7.4 million, I like the fact that we are increasing those numbers, doing it in a nice size and also particularly really like the fact that our growth rate of return on the combination was significantly higher than some other people in our space. So, I was very happy to see that. I didn't catch the second part of James' question. Sure. Okay. So, what I would said is we are going to experiment. And we really see, we always want to experiment, where do things work, where do we see return for it, where do we see how this is working so well. So, we are going to continue to experiment and we do have, for example, rental cars well established into our Genius program. Obviously, our combination as well and we are going to experiment with all the different verticals. And the thing, is there a way to do in flights, is there a way to do it in track and how do we do it in terms of potentially even insurance, in all sorts of ways, our ride business when people need a ride from the airport to the hotel or hotel to the airport or from their home to the airport. Again, and this goes back to the first question, I think it was Justin asked about AI and about how you use data. And that's kind of one of the key things is when you have these models, and you can figure out what the best way to provide a benefit, and that's through our loyalty Genius program, that's doing that in a way that it provides value to the traveler, that's where they use us, that's why they come back to us. That's why they come to us direct. Maybe they will use the app because it's so simple to do it. At the same time, Genus is primarily almost right now, primarily being funded by our partners because they see value in that. They see value in providing a discount or some other type of benefit that we put into the offering, so that the travelers will book, that supplier what they want to sell. And doing to get it in a scientific way in doing it in a way that is going to make sure that we are not leaving value out of the cycle in a way that's not going to be beneficial to our supplier partners, doing it smartly, that's the thing that I love. And that's why we are going to continue to experiment on that. And I think it's worked so well in hotels and I think it's in a combination, alternative accommodations, I think this is going to work great in all of it. But we will see after we expand it. So, if the question was really how do we get from here early stage showing good signs, but it's still small to scale and really showing the bottom line and top line and a loyalty and all those things, I think that \u2013 is that the question really? Yes. So, look, one of the things that we have to \u2013 and I have said this is a long-term path. And the first thing was we had to build the verticals to begin with. One of the fun things was to mention that we started Booking.com we got off the ground in 2019 and now put all our flight numbers together, you see 400% increase there that's included, of course, Priceline had placed before that, where you just see the growth rate of flights right now, great. So, we got that vertical up and we got excellences up and attract is still early, but up. But these things \u2013 all of these things are the car rental was up, but we still do on that and of course the rides business and others. All of these things are at different levels of development, but still relatively new. And one of that, then we have to build all the modeling, all the ways to figure out what's the best way to offer one versus the other, and make sure that we are doing it the right way. And then it's working with our partner suppliers to provide us and prove out to them that this is worthwhile to them. All of these things take time. But I do like to say, we are seeing those signals. We are seeing the numbers. It is early and I am not going to do \u2013 I am sure you would like me to give you some numbers, say, here is what it's going to be tomorrow. Here is what the next milestone. I am going to do that. And I can't say I see we are on the right path. Thank you. So, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, our shareholders. And as mentioned by a couple of people on the call, I have to give out a very special thank you to my very good friend and colleague, David Goulden. As you know, after 24 earnings calls as Booking Holdings CFO, he is retiring from this role and will be working on other areas of the business going forward. We greatly appreciate everything that David has done for this company, and we greatly appreciate everyone else's support as well as we continue to build on the long-term vision of our company. Thank you very much and good night."

And now, I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I'm encouraged by the strong results we are reporting today and by the strong leisure travel demand environment that we continue to see. In the third quarter, our traveler customers booked 276 million, or more than a quarter of a billion room nights, which was an increase of 15% year-over-year, and we had gross bookings of $40 billion, which was an increase of 24% year-over-year. Room night growth versus 2019 was 24% in Q3. Both room nights and gross bookings were record quarterly amounts for the company, and both came in ahead of our previous expectations. Third quarter revenue of $7.3 billion grew 21% and adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion increased 24%, both versus Q3 last year, and both exceeded our prior expectations. Finally, our non-GAAP earnings per share in the quarter grew 36% year-over-year, and was nearly 60% higher than in the third quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share growth benefited from our improved profit levels, as well as our strong capital return program, which reduced our end-of-quarter share count by 10% versus the third quarter of 2022. Now, turning to October, we estimate that room night growth was about 8% year-over-year and about 20% versus 2019. Excluding Israel, we estimate these growth rates would have been about 9% and 22%, respectively. We saw a significant negative impact on our business in Israel, and there was some impact on travel trends outside of Israel. Nevertheless, we were encouraged to see global room night growth improve towards the end of the month. And David will explain more about October in his remarks. Overall, we continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand. And as we take a very early look ahead to 2024, we see strong growth on the books for travel that will take place in the first quarter of next year, though a high percentage of these bookings are cancellable. Given current trends, we expect customers and consumers will continue to prioritize travel over other discretionary spend in 2024. I firmly believe we are well-positioned to continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform, while making progress on several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long-term. These initiatives include: one, advancing our connected trip vision. 2, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, 3; continuing to grow alternative accommodations, and four, building more direct relationships with our traveler customers. Starting with the Connected Trip: this is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. In the third quarter, we saw an increase in the percentage of transactions which we count as connected trips, meaning two or more travel components within a trip. Though still a small percentage of our total transactions today, it is encouraging to see an increasing number of our travelers booking more elements of their travel with us. Outside of accommodations, one of the most important elements of travel is flights, and we continue to focus on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com. In the third quarter, air tickets booked increased 57% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering. To provide some context on how this has developed over the last few years, the 9 million tickets booked on our platforms during the third quarter were more than 5x the number of air tickets booked through us in Q3 2019. This significant growth of our flight offering at Booking.com over the last 4 years was achieved through our successful partnership with Etraveli. As previously announced, our proposed acquisition of Etraveli was blocked by the European Commission in September, a decision we will appeal. While we strongly disagree with the EC\u2019s decision to block the deal, our commitment to building the flight vertical at Booking.com has not changed. In fact, we have extended our partnership agreement with Etraveli through at least the end of 2028, which means we anticipate continuing to work with them on improving Booking.com's flight offering over the coming years. We believe offering a compelling flight product alongside our accommodation, ground transportation, and attractions offerings, helps to create a better, easier, and more comprehensive travel booking experience for our travelers, and more opportunities for our partners. We will continue to build out our Connected Trip vision, which we believe will ultimately result in increased customer and supplier engagement with our platform. As we discussed last quarter, we have always envisioned AI technology at the center of the Connected Trip, and we have a long history of investing in AI technology and incorporating it in our platforms across our company. I previously spoke about the hard work our teams have been doing to integrate Generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Priceline\u2019s generative AI travel assistant, named Penny, and Booking.com\u2019s AI Trip Planner. It is still very early days, but both teams are gaining valuable insights on booker questions, concerns, and behavior as the tools continue to interact with customers. At Priceline, we are seeing some encouraging signs of lower customer service contact rates, and we are exploring other areas across our business where we believe we can use generative AI tools to increase productivity For example, our brands are running projects using generative AI to enhance the productivity of our software developers with encouraging results so far. And we look forward to using these tools more widely in the future. I remain confident in our company\u2019s ability to benefit from AI developments by improving our products for our customers and operating more efficiently over time. Turning to our supply partners: we strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, and we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. During the quarter, some of our partners at Booking.com experienced delayed payments due to a planned upgrade to our finance and payment platforms in early July. We have now cleared the backlog of outstanding payment issues related to this system upgrade. We plan to provide compensation to partners who experienced an extended delay, and we recorded this in our Q3 results. We plan to communicate to all partners who were impacted by these payment delays within the next few days We continue to focus on strengthening our alternative accommodations offering at Booking.com by increasing supply and raising awareness among travelers. In the third quarter, alternative accommodation room nights grew at about 24% year-over-year, which was faster than our traditional hotel category. Alternative accommodations represented about 33% of Booking.com's total room nights, which was 3 percentage points higher than in Q3 2022. We are seeing continued momentum in terms of alternative accommodations supply growth both globally and in the U.S., with global listings reaching about 7.2 million by the end of the third quarter, which is about 9% higher than Q3 last year. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increasing loyalty, frequency, spend, and direct relationships over time. In the third quarter, our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continued to increase year-over-year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. For the first time ever for our company, over 50% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the third quarter, which is about 6 percentage points higher than in Q3 2022. This is a remarkable achievement considering the mix of our mobile app room nights in the third quarter of 2019 was about 18 percentage points lower than it was in the third quarter this year. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong third quarter results and the continued resilience of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well for the long-term. We continue our work to deliver a better offering and experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We are confident in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the third quarter as well as our thoughts for Q4 and the full year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings investor relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call.  Now onto our third quarter results. We are pleased to report 15% room night growth in Q3, which was a few percentage points better than our expectations. Looking at our year-on-year room night growth by region in the third quarter, Asia was up about 35%, Rest of World was up mid-teens, Europe was up low double digits and the U.S. was up low single digits. Compared to 2019, our Q3 global room night growth was 24%. The average booking window at Booking.com expanded in Q3 versus the same period in both 2022 and 2019, and was a bit more expanded versus the prior year periods than it was in Q2. In Q3, our mobile apps represented over half of our total room nights for the first time ever. The Q3 mobile app mix of about 51% was about six percentage points higher than the third quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the third quarter relative to the third quarter of 2022. The Q3 international mix of our total room nights was over 50%, up from about 45% in the third quarter of 2022. The Q3 international mix was in line with 2019 levels, similar to the second quarter. Our cancellation rates in the third quarter were slightly higher than Q3 2022, but were slightly below Q3 2019. Cancellation rates were the same as in Q2. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q3 room night growth was about 24% year-over-year and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 33%, which was a few points higher than Q3 2022. Q3 gross bookings increased 24% year-over-year, or 21% on a constant currency basis. The 24% increase in gross bookings was 9 percentage points higher than the 15% room night increase due to about 4% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, plus about 3 percentage points of positive impact from FX movements, and also due to about 2 percentage points from flight bookings. Our year-over-year ADR growth was negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia and a lower mix of room nights from the U.S. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 7 percentage points year-on-year. Despite the higher ADRs in the third quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star-rating levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the third quarter were up about 57% year-on-year driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the third quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 21% year-over-year, or about 18% on a constant currency basis. Although we had a stronger-than-expected Q3 from a room night and gross bookings perspective, the outperformance versus our expectations was mostly driven by mainly bookings that are for travel in future quarters. As a result, we did not see all of the revenue benefit in Q3 from these incremental bookings. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 was 18.4%, which was lower-than-expected due to this timing effect. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 13% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 50 basis points lower than Q3 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 was about 30 basis points lower than last year, which was a little better than our expectations, driven by the improved performance marketing ROIs. Q3 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 10 basis points compared with last year, a bit better than our expectations. About 51% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q3, up from about 40% in Q3 2022. For the total company, 56% of gross bookings were merchant, up from about 45% in Q3 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 24% year-over-year, which was below our expectation, due to lower personnel and personnel related expenses. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. On a GAAP basis, our more fixed expenses were up 33% year-over-year and included a $90 million accrual in G&A expense for the termination fee related to the acquisition agreement for Etraveli, this accrual was excluded from our non-GAAP results Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion in the third quarter, which was up 24% year-over-year, and would have been up 22% on a constant currency basis. This was also ahead of our expectations. Non-GAAP net income of $2.6 billion in the third quarter resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $72.32 per share, which was up 36% year-over-year. Our average share count in the third quarter was 9% below Q3 2022 and 16% below Q3 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $2.5 billion in the quarter Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash and investments balance of $14.3 billion was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $15.7 billion due to the $2.6 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter, partially offset by the $1.3 billion of free cash flow generated in the third quarter. We repurchased $7.7 billion of our shares through the first three quarters, which represents 8% of our year-end 2022 share count. The repurchases so far this year take our combined authorization down to $16 billion from the total of $24 billion we discussed earlier in the year. Our buyback program takes our share price into account and at current share price levels we expect to spend more on buybacks in Q4 than we did in Q3. We remain comfortable with our ability to complete the full $24 billion of share repurchases within 4 years from when we started the program at the beginning of this year, assuming no major downturn in the travel environment. Now onto our thoughts for the fourth quarter of 2023. In October, we estimate year-over-year room night growth was about 8%, down from 15% in Q3 due in part to a tougher year-on-year compare, as well as the war in the Middle East. When comparing versus 2019, October room night growth was about 20%. Excluding Israel, October room nights grew about 9% versus 2022 and about 22% versus 2019. The 22% growth versus October 2019 excluding Israel is a little lower than the 24% growth we saw in Q3 versus 2019. Looking across our major regions, in October we saw Asia year-on-year growth of room nights without 15%, Europe up about 10%, and the U.S. and Rest of World were down slightly. The impact of the Israel-Hamas war is seen most in the Rest of World growth numbers. Israel on a booker plus inbound travel basis is about 1% of our global room nights. The Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, on a booker basis is about 4% of our global room nights. Globally, we saw a slowdown starting the second week of October due to cancellations and a drop in new bookings after the start of the war in the Middle East. The cancellations we saw that started in the second week of October were concentrated in Israel, but we also saw some impact on travel trends outside of the country as people absorbed the news. We were pleased to see room night growth recover towards the end of the month. Our comments for the fourth quarter make the assumption that room night growth will be up about 9% year-over-year. When comparing versus 2019, this means we expect Q4 room night growth to be about 20%. This outlook assumes that there is no further expansion of the war in the Middle East. We expect Q4 gross bookings to grow about 5% -- points of about 5 points faster than room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a couple points from higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, including some pressure from changes in regional mix, as well as a couple of points from continued flight bookings growth. We expect Q4 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 15%, which would be higher than Q4 last year due to benefits from timing. We expect Q4 marketing expenses as a percentage of bookings -- gross bookings to be slightly lower than last year. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q4 to be slightly higher than last year as we continue to look for opportunities to lean in. We expect Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about in line with last year as the higher merchant gross bookings mix is offset by efficiencies in payments costs. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q4 to grow a couple of points faster year-over-year than it did in the third quarter. Taking all this into account, we\u2019d expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be just over $1.4 billion. Our year-to-date results plus our fourth quarter commentary means that for the full year we expect room nights to grow in the mid-to high-teens year-over-year. We currently expect full year gross bookings growth of over 20% year-on-year. We currently expect revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to increase year-on-year by about 10 basis points, down from our previous expectation for a 20 basis point increase due to higher bookings growth and a longer booking window, which reduce the expected benefit from timing. We continue to expect full year marketing and merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly below 2022, and for our more fixed expenses to grow around 25% year-over-year. We manage our more fixed costs very carefully and continue to expect our more fixed expenses next year to grow at an appreciably lower rate than this year. We continue to expect that our adjusted EBITDA margins will expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our Q3 results, the trends we are seeing into Q4 and with the bookings we have already received for early 2024. We are now [technical difficulty].\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Thanks. I will ask two questions, please. Glenn, I think just at the very beginning you mentioned something about March quarter, a visibility into the March quarter. Is there anything in particular that you were trying to hint at or point to the areas of that, because the bookings went as a little longer than you get. Do you have more visibility into the March quarter than you typically do. And then secondly, the David the room night growth, upside this quarter that came in a little bit faster than your guidance. What would you attribute that to was at a particular region that contributed to that or was that the alternative accommodations that came in a little bit stronger than you thought. Just the sources of room night growth upside in the quarter. Thank you very much.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Mark. I was not saying that I see more than I normally do. I'm just saying I was very pleased to see this resiliency in global leisure travel demand and saying that we're looking at 2024, we're seeing strong growth on the books for travel. And that's going to happen in the first quarter. So it's just reinforcing my belief that travel is healthy. And we're looking forward to continue healthy travel.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, Mark, to answer your question relates a little bit to what Glenn just said. Our upside in the quarter, our room night growth was driven by travel -- expect by stronger travel demand across the peak season and along the booking window. If you remember, we said that coming into Q3, we have exceeded -- we see the booking lengthening of the booking window in Q1, Q2. And therefore we expected fewer last minute bookings in Q3. Well, the last minute bookings in Q3 were a little lower than we would have expected any year when we didn't have that long booking window. But what we got were more bookings for longer periods of time out there. So the booking window actually expanded in Q3. And that created the situation that Glenn talked about where we now looking into the first quarter of next year, because of the strong demand we saw for bookings, a lot of which are outside of the quarter plus the window means that our Q1 on the books situation is much stronger than it has been prior to the current situation.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David.\nDavid Goulden: I would also just comment that the over performance we saw versus our expectation was across all different regions, I wouldn't call one region out. We actually did that and we expected in all regions when compared to our guidance, looking at the actual for the quarter for room night growth.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Thank you, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one for Glenn and one for David. Glenn, you've been working on Connected Trip for a long time. Obviously, a lot of progress with air and other areas. If this vision really works out, what does it mean for Bookings financials? And do you think you're accelerating the pace of progress there? And then for David, we see the U.S., which reopened first at kind of low single-digit growth. How are you thinking about Europe comps next year? And can you just remind us of your kind of relative exposure by geography? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: So, Justin, hello. And I have been talking about the Connected Trip for a while, because I do believe that really is a differentiator in the long run, and why someone would come to us and continue to come to us rather than another way to do their travel. So in the long run, of course, if somebody's coming direct, because they really enjoy the way we do it versus an alternative that of course, the lower the marketing cost, you wouldn't have to reacquire that, that customer. It's interesting because the small send small data, but we do see people who book more than one element with us currently, we do see some benefits the person coming back more frequently, and a higher direct. So I like that. And I think we can do a lot more with them. Now, one of the things that we're not the only person doing this, of course, in this competition, because I think a lot of people see this. And now, on top of this, the whole benefits of generative AI, along with all the AI work we've been doing for a long time. And we see the potential to create a much better experience in discovery, planning and executing your travel in a way that if we do this, right, we may be able to greatly accelerate the growth of the company, because it really is transformationally different versus just incrementally different. And that's what we're striving for. Now, that's not going to happen tomorrow, you know that I know that it's not going to happen next week, next quarter. Not going to happen next year. It's going to take time to get all this built out. But what I'm really pleased about is seeing historically, we said what we're going to do, and we've been doing it, and we're showing markers along the way, hitting milestones, hitting a slight growth rate still, 57% of air ticket booking I talked about talking about, that's 5x greater than 2019. We said we're going to do it, and we did it, and we're going forward. In so many of these other areas where I believe that people are frustrated in the way they travel now. We can do it better. We'll achieve great things, both for the traveler, of course. We're going to achieve great opportunities for our partners to give them more opportunities to get more business working with us. And then of course, together those things will end up with a great derivative, which is more value for the shareholders. That's what we're trying to do. And I'm really pleased to where we are.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, thank you, Glenn. And then, Justin, relative to your question. Yes, we were pleased to see room night growth year-over-year in the U.S market. Don't forget, in the U.S., our room nights are over 30% higher than they were in 2019. So we have made significant strides in terms of advancing our overall position in the U.S., if you compare that with market growth rates are probably more likely recovered versus 2019, not up by 30%. When we think about next year, I don't want to get into too much detail. But I will give you a couple of things to think about. I'd say that when you look across all the regions, if you look at where travel as a percentage of GDP is going to wind up in 2023 compared to where it was in 2019, it still has some recovery, before it fully gets back to the percentage of GDP. It used to be in 2019. So I think that provides upside. I'd also say that, as Glenn said in his comments, and as we see, we do see consumers continue to crack and travel of other discretionary expense items, we don't see any reason why that should change based on current trends. And then also just relative to our own view of the business, we're still committed to our milestones we gave you and said we will continue to grow faster post COVID than we were before on the top line and bottom line and consequently basis, that was 8% bookings on revenue, 8% on bookings, 8% on revenue, 15% earnings per share or constant currency growth rates in 2019. And whilst we're not talking about even specific, around 2024, we are still sticking to those overall guidelines and outlooks.\nJustin Post: Thank you, Glenn. Thank you, David. Very helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nKevin Kopelman: Thanks a lot. Could you comment on the outsized growth in alternative accommodations that you saw in Q3? I think in Q2, the growth was closer to the overall growth. So what were the drivers there any regions and then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: So, Kevin, why don\u2019t I start and David can add on anything I fail to add in. Obviously, very, very pleased with that number. That's a really good growth rate. And when we compare it to some other people in the space, I'm very impressed by what we've been able to accomplish. And I will shout out to the whole team that works on alternative accommodations. But there's some again. I've been talking about for some time about, we need to improve the product, we need to make people aware of it. And by doing that, we'll get more business. And that's what we've been doing. Now I can do all the things I've talked about them in the past, and we continue to do things to make it a better product. And there's still a lot of things that need to be done to make it even better. And that's what we're going to keep on doing. There's no magic bullet. No, no silver bullet and tell, here's how it came about. It comes through a lot of hard work and a lot of different ways of just grinding away, cranking out making it better talking with the suppliers who have these properties, making sure we're marketing appropriately when people want that property, they can find it and they see it. All those things together will enable us to achieve what I think was a very, very good print on the growth rate there. But I'll tell you, we're not there yet. And I mentioned look, I want to increase the supply a lot more look, it's great. 9% increase. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks and the increase up to 7.2 billion listings. That's great. That's good. But I know there are a lot of areas we need to add even more, particularly in the United States, because that's the place that I want to use our product. Because if I look for anything, and I don't see it. Well, to me, that's upside down. We're doing great right now. And I still see so much opportunity ahead because for example, we don't have enough properties in certain areas and other product features that we need to improve upon. All together. I look at this great opportunity. We're going to well, and we will do it even better in the future. I hope and David, anything specific to add to that? Okay.\nDavid Goulden: Nope, nope. Thank you. That was great.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, let me just ask about the U.S. a little bit. You've made some really good progress in the U.S. post COVID, but it has decelerated quite a bit, and now it even down in the most recent months. So Glenn, I guess the question is, as you look into 2024, what are the keys to sort of reaccelerating that U.S. growth from here to sort of contribute to your goal of growing faster post-COVID than you were pre-COVID. So what drives U.S. growth from here? And then secondly, any quantifiable metrics or factors you can share with us on progress on Genius and the Loyalty program over the course of the summer into the fall?\nGlenn Fogel: Yes, sure. Thank you, Brian. So, the U.S is not that much different than any other geography in terms of the elements that help create growth are providing a better product. Enabling people to be able to find the properties they want, at the right price, and the easiest thing to do and if anything goes wrong, given great customer service. That's the playbook. And yes, I -- some of the numbers look a little funky. And of course, COVID is really create all sorts of things, different geographies come out faster than others. So you're comparing a year-over-year, and maybe it looks like a deceleration and then there's domestic and international events, I think a good way to look those like compare back to 2019. And the fact is, we've achieved, we've accomplished some great things in terms of increasing our share in the U.S. And we keep on doing what we have been doing. And that will continue to increase that share. And I just mentioned in the previous question about our alternative accommodations, which is important part of growing out of the U.S. And another thing is also you mentioned Genius. So I'll switch over to there. -- and that is continue to develop the Genius program in a way that continues to provide not only great value to the traveler, which of course, is an obvious one, but it's providing opportunity for our partners to be able to get incremental demand when they need it, where they need and how they need it. Working that together is a way for us to provide a better opportunity for both sides of this marketplace to achieve greater value for both sides. And I think that we have that great thing, layer on all those other things we talk about with the whole idea of the Connected Trip. Bring in more of the Generative AI stuff. And altogether, I think this is a good playbook to try and continue to grow our share in the U.S. And again, we've been doing it for some time now. So I'm really pleased with where we stand.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thanks. I had a couple, if I can. First, it sounds like you're still talking about holding this lean in posture on marketing with the leverage on I think marketing plus merchandising in 4Q. As growth slows, should we expect to see you all moderate that posture and get more leverage? And I guess looking at markets, like the U.S growing low single digits? Are you still holding that that posture there? Or are you kind of bifurcating the strategy differently as different markets are perhaps more recovered. Anything you could share there would be great. And then the second one would just be sort of related. But as more than half of room nights are now booked through the mobile app, should that also be an increasing driver of marketing leverage? Or do you think just escalating pricing in performance channels offsets that, so it's kind of balance that? How should we think about that? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: So Lloyd, let me talk a little bit about this and all we do and add other facts that he wants to add in here. And I want to be very careful here. Obviously, the one thing I don't want to do is give away our [indiscernible] ideas and all the things we're going to play with our competitors listening in on this. So you'll understand it, while it'll be a little bit general in this. But one of the things I continue to try and talked to the team about is we need to be nimble. We need to be agile, and we need to be able to be smart and move into markets, where we see opportunities and pull back in other places where we think we're not going to get the right ROIs. Whether that be a geography, whether it be a channel, would that be developing a entire product, whatever it is, I don't look at any of these in a different way. I look at all together holistically. What we're trying to do to achieve growth at the right type of profitability levels. And we're going to continue to do that. Right now, as David said, we have a lean-in position because we see opportunity here. Time can -- these things can change depending on the time. And certainly, the idea is to say I'm going to do this for a long-term period is it's a nice thing to say, but who knows what the world is going to be like, and as we all see, unfortunately, the world can change very, very rapidly. So we'll continue to do this, and this is our profile right now the way David explained those numbers for what we are going to disclose right now. But you should always recognize that we have an overall view of how to do things, but we will be willing to change, depending on circumstances. Regarding the mobile app, I talked about, David, why don't you just take in terms of how that will apply to our numbers going forward.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, Lloyd, I'd add a couple of comments. So first of all, just to kind of pick up on what Glenn lets off on the leading in. We are leading into a recovery marketplace. I said, there's still on one of my other answers, there's so some recovery of travel as a percentage of GDP post-COVID left tap into 2024. We haven't seen it fully recover yet. So there are still opportunities to do that. You'll notice though, that we are in lower spending more on marketing, merchandising, in 2023, than we did in 2019. We are getting leverage relative to what we spent in 2022. As a couple things happen. One as our direct mix increases, and of course mobile is highly correlated to direct mix. The majority, the vast majority of all our mobile -- of all of that mobile app bookings are in fact direct bookings, so that helps as well. So and then you did make a reference, I would just say to Q4, and I wouldn't read too much into Q4. Here's how I would explain why we expect to get some deleverage in marketing in Q4, relative to the other quarter where we've shown leverage. It's really quite simple. We're having a strong year, and we decided to invest in some additional programs in Q4 that will help us finish the year well. And to build on our momentum going into 2024. So that was us. It's very conscious. Again, we are not going to go into the playbook in terms of what they are or where they are, but we recognize that we're doing well this year financially, delivering great EBITDA and results. So we are leaning a little bit in Q4 to position us well, the first year and going to 2024 strong. Again, that's what we are doing. Not driven by any [indiscernible] in the marketplace is our conscious decision. Of course, we'll still create leverage on marketing merchandising for the full year.\nLloyd Walmsley: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Glenn, you talked about expecting a strong 2024. Just curious if you have any more color on how you're thinking about the outlook for ADRs next year. I think you said it was a 4% increase in 3Q. Any more thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: I will let David talk about what you wants to [indiscernible]. I don't think we talked about 2024. I think we talked first quarter. I will let David, clarify whatever he wants to clarify.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, Doug, I mean, the 2024 conversation, we're going to have that when we get into February next year, I really don't want to have -- how that now. We've told you a little bit about the strength of the on the books in the first quarter given the strength of bookings in the booking window. And we talked a little bit about our framework for growth post-COVID hasn't changed. So I want to keep anything beyond that until we get to see a little bit more. We are talking to you next time, of course, we'll give you much more insight at that point in time. But it's too early to talk about the specifics of line items in the income statement in 2024.\nDoug Anmuth: Okay. Thank you, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLee Horowitz: Great, thanks. Maybe following up on some of the comments around sort of the vacation rental industry? Can we talk a bit more about sort of the U.S vacation rental business. Glenn, you talked about growing supply and building product functionality in order to continue to grow that. [Technical difficulty] getting this incremental products rolled out and getting supply to the place where you are competitive relative to some others in the market. So how do we think of sort of the timeline and maybe even the investment dollars needed to get that business to the place where you want to get it to?\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Lee. Well, you won't be surprised, I'm not actually going to give out the details exactly how and what level and what amount of money we're going to put to work out and what the methods are. I will say that the best way to look at this and look at what we've done historically. And where the numbers have been going and how the growth has been going. That's the best indication for you in terms of thinking forward, how -- what we're going to end up in result, and the results going to be. I will say that it's fairly obvious to be looked at our site and tries to find homes in certain properties and in certain parts of the U.S., you can see perhaps you don't have enough of them in those areas. So it would not be illogical to think that's where we'll start going to. As we talked in the past, we think that there is a lower hanging fruit for us in properties that are controlled or managed by larger groups of properties, makes it easier for us to get that. So I'm not giving anything away here. When I say, well, we'll let us go there first, and let's be sure we're doing that. And for example, you may have noticed that recently started doing the request on demand type of thing, where a person doesn't automatically be able to book instantly. And that's a product improvement because some people in, let's say, higher quality or higher value properties. Perhaps the owner or the manager did not want to have an instant booking and want to have a chance to do it on request basis. So that's an improvement thing. So we'll continue to roll out all these different things that we think will make our property -- our product as good as anybody else's, it applies the money to the appropriate marketing to make sure people are aware of it, and that will enable us to continue the growth that we've seen so far, I hope.\nLee Horowitz: Helpful. Thanks. And then maybe one follow-up on perhaps another air of the low hanging fruit. Can you comment at all on anything you're seeing in terms of APAC outbound travel pattern, travel patterns, and how much room there may be in this travel quarter sort of cover back to pre-COVID levels. Should we be thinking -- thinking of this travel pattern as a source of premium growth in the medium term?\nGlenn Fogel: I'm not sure the term premium growth, I'll just say, well, we talked a little bit about, look, we talked some time about different geographies coming back faster in other areas. Asia was certainly the one who was last. And of course, it looks good when you're starting to see the, nice growth rate those regions as the other ones start getting more normalized. It's a nice thing to say. It's certainly outbound for example, outbound China still significantly behind, when you look at any of the industry reports, and think how much lift do they have going out bond, et cetera. Although that's a small part of our business, not going to make a huge difference even when it starts to come back. So overall, look, we love to see that Asia is going to get back to where all the other parts of the world are -- and I really do and I understand the term premium that you mentioned, maybe explain that I could give a better explanation.\nLee Horowitz: I guess just faster growth relative to the core.\nGlenn Fogel: Oh, faster. Okay. I thought maybe you're talking about more expensive travel or something?\nLee Horowitz: No, no, no, no.\nGlenn Fogel: Okay, got it. Sorry. Thank you.\nLee Horowitz: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe come back to the topic of Air, where I understood on the comments about appealing Travel decision from the European Commission. If we go beyond that appeal and think about how you plan on building scale in a the supply side. I would love to know how are you thinking about some of the investments that are key to build that as opposed to possibly going down the acquisition route in Air. And where you've already deployed Air, especially markets like North America, can you remind us of what Air has done in terms of growing overall checkout baskets and return on trip side? Thank you so much \nGlenn Fogel: I will let David handle that last part. In terms of the appeal, the appeal will take some time. This type of court action is not going to happen overnight. I can't tell you exactly how long it will take, but it's not going to happen anytime soon. So I would not put anything in terms of what that will mean for [indiscernible] in the relative future. However, we do like the fact that we do have this new agreement with Etraveli, going out to 2028. That's really great. Also, as you know, it's not just booked many travel line. That's one area of our air business. We have Priceline. Of course, that's that company started Priceline or as an Air product. That was the first product. We have lots of good relationships with air travel there. I obviously am very disappointed by the European Commission's blocking, what I believe would have been an extremely beneficial transaction for the travelers, good for them, were they good for the partners, good for them. And together, this will create value, which, of course, would have come back to all the people involved in the company, whether they be for higher value for our shareholders, a higher value for our employees working on , et cetera. Very disappointing decision, we moved on. We will continue to develop this product. And by the way, it's been growing very nicely even though we didn't actually have possession of Etraveli, and yet, we still were able to reduce 57% increase in air tickets. David, I'll let you if you want to talk anything about basket size and things around if you do.\nDavid Goulden: I can talk about where we are with some of the customer oriented dynamics around there, Eric, I think will be helpful. So we said this is about Booking.com, which is of course where Air is still relatively new and growing very rapidly. We said previously that over 20% of Air customers are brand new to us. We've never seen them before, that continues to be the case, as the business grows, which is very, very healthy. We also see that those new customers who are booking Air [Indiscernible] who've never booked anything prior to that with us, are doing a healthy attachment rate from into accommodation because these are brand-new customers. So you wouldn't expect that attachment ratio to be all that high, but it's quite healthy. Not quite as high as examples of what we're doing with Priceline where we've been doing that for many years. But it's certainly an encouraging attachment rate. What I would tell you, though, on the other side, of course, by definition, most of the air that we are selling is to existing customers, which you would expect. And there is a very good attach rate on those air tickets to accommodation because these customers know us from an a combination background in the first place. What I would also say is that we still have good data that says that customers who buy multiple things from us, whether they be the new customers or the existing customers buying air and the combination. We have good data that says that, that will drive better frequency, loyalty, future basket size, getting them kind of up that loyalty and frequency curve that we talked about to the higher value customers. So the dynamics around air are still healthy and they haven't changed. We are encouraged about them. And as you can see, they're helping us in multiple different ways.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Your line is open.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Glenn, I wanted to ask a little bit more about AI. And just you talked about a little bit in your script as to consumer adoption of the booking tools, a trip planner. Wondering if this adoption is trending as you would have expected, I think we're still relatively early days. And you also mentioned the common around lower customer care costs because of AI. So any insights there would be helpful. And David, we don't hear too much about just the milestones coming out of COVID. I know they're there, we've talked about it, but just remind us a little bit more about the underlying assumptions of maybe the bookings and revenue growth. Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Okay. AI. We only have so much time because I could go on for a long time on this, so I'll try and concise my thoughts on this. So as in all new technologies, the hype is always great, very beginning or [indiscernible] thing is going to be the greatest thing some slice bread, but then it takes longer than it takes to toast a slice to actually haven't needed. That's the thing about what we are seeing is that it's really exciting. I absolutely believe it's going to be transformative, but it's going to take a long time. And when I said in my prepared remarks about this is very early, it is very, very early. Now some of the stuff that we are seeing and that we have done enough so we see some data to see there are going to be some good benefits. So the example of the customer service example is, for example, you have a customer service agent, who actually is able to use a copilot, let's call it, with AI agent that helps enable that customers or agent answer the question or taking action much faster, than they would have been able to do previously. Particularly in terms of a number of years, the person has been a CS agent and maybe a CS agent has been there forever. They're instant how do everything perfectly is great and all that. But if you're a relatively new CS agent, this is going to be extremely healthy for that person. As you know, the turnover of CS agents is very great because there's a good efficiency productivity game there. Then everybody, I'm sure, has read lots about how coding can be greatly increased in terms of speed and efficiency, using some of these copilots in terms of coating. So there's another area, again, early stages, just seeing it, but we do believe that is going to do something like that. And then you go on into the things that we have for the customer. And the things like Priceline and their Penny product. We're a customer when they're about to buy something, there's a chatbot where they can put in a question because they get not sure they want to buy or not. And instead of having to go all the way back up the funnel to find the information they say, do they want to buy or not, using that chatbot, they can be instantly given an answer that will help convert that person into a buy much faster and actually not losing as much. And questions be everything one of the things that I've noticed is coming a lot is, can I bring my dog to the hotel. And actually, it can become quite a conversational type thing where, yes, you can't bring your dog and so, but my dog is a very big dog. How big is your dog and if you go back [indiscernible] that's using our information that we have -- that's all our current end using an LLM in combination [indiscernible] this type of chat relationship. That's really good. And then you can go to the other things, we're in the Booking.com AI product, which is really trying to create an itinerary, the discovery from the very top and going down. And then when it offers hotels, it integrates with our hotel condos [ph], you can book right data also very good. Now both those things relatively small usage of any of these things compared to the overall size of the amount of inquiries we get a number of bookings, we do in terms of the overall size of the company. But it's very encouraging that this stuff really does matter, and it's going to make a difference. Now the question would be how long until we get sort of that hit that inflection point, where people start saying, \"oh, this is so much better. I don't know that yet. But we're going to keep on experimenting on all these things, increasing the efficiencies. So we can do things faster with a lower cost and at the same time, increasing things for the travelers to make sure they want to come and use our products and our services versus anybody else's. That's the plan right now, and I like it. And David, I'm not sure what the second question was.\nDavid Goulden: Yes, I will talk a little bit about a framework for post-COVID recovery because I think that's important. So we've committed that when the dust settles and the market goes back to normal growth rates, whenever that is, we'll be a larger and faster-growing business. Delivering more EPS and faster-growing EPS than we did before. So larger and faster growing on the top line and the bottom line. So why do we think that is the case? Well, we will have made a ton of progress. So the comparison point is 2019. If 2024 is the year that we get to normalized growth rates, it will be 5 years later. If it's 2025, it will be 6 years later. But the business is so fundamentally different in, the business we had in 2019. I think we need just to step back and remind you of that. So, what we've done since 2019 and mainly around Booking.com, but other parts of the business have also contributed as well. Back then, we were mainly, an accommodation mainly hotel, mainly agency business. So since then, we have added a significant alternative accommodation business, which is now very sizable and now we're trying to be for growing quickly. We have -- back then, we did very little in payments. Now over half of our business is transacted through Payment. So we built out our payments platform, which is enabling better service for customers and partners. We have built out air taxi and car capability, we didn't have back in. Back in 2019, we were great at performance marketing. We didn't do much around merchandising. We've now developed a big merchandising arm and capability, but also we've refined our performance marketing tools to the level where we really think we can lean into recurring marketplaces and gain share more aggressively than we did back then. And then, of course, we've added our Genius program and enhanced it significantly. So we believe that we have made huge strides since 2019, which is our comparison point when we grew at 8% on the top line, constant currency bookings and revenue. And of course, this year, we are going to be a lot bigger than we were in 2019. But you add all those capabilities together, and we believe we have a fundamentally different and more competitive business that's providing more value to our customers and partners and is much, much for towards the vision of the Connected Trip than we had back then. And that's why we are confident that we can grow faster and have a bigger business that grows faster on the top line and the bottom line than we had in 2019. That is the framework.\nRon Josey: Super helpful. Thank you both.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for me. So as more bookings come through the app, I'm curious how repeat rates have trended among more recent cohorts on the app or whether you're seeing any diminishing returns and stickiness as you move beyond early adopters into the longer tail? And second, are you seeing any patterns in behavior like demand strength in higher priced hotels that's giving you confidence in consumers' continued continuation of prioritizing travel spend over other forms of discretionary spend next year? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Let me just take that last one, and then I'll let Dave. I'm not sure what we disclose and what we don't disclose about your first question. Obviously, it's an important one. So we say -- and we've said this several times, several quarters [indiscernible], the same question keeps coming up in different forms of -- do we see any softening? Do we see anything decline? Do we see a decrease in star rating? Do you see a decrease in length of stay and things like that. We say no. And that's what we'll be -- no and no. In terms of why we believe that discretionary spending will continue to travel versus other things, that's obviously a lot of the survey. So I can maybe a whole bunch of things that are independent, third-party actual people are saying they're going to do etcetera. Here's something more important though. And I really try and stress this is how important the long is in terms of how we think about the business and increasing value. So if we agree that over time, GDP for the world will continue to increase and per capita GDP will continue to increase. It's fairly logical that as people get wealthier, they're going to spend more of their money on things that are services or experiences than they are things. Once you going rich enough to have, let's say an apartment, you have one apartment in generally or you have one sofa. You're not going to buy a sofa each year. What you're going to do is you need to get more money is you will travel either more frequently or in a higher level of style travel or you'll do both. And we see that over and over again, when you go look at countries and you see what the amount of the -- ease to look at his international travel, which is a higher I think you know that's going to be a higher level for some people. And you see, as the GDP for a person there goes up. You see the amount of going outbound travel increases, too. So that's why I believe that this is in the long run. We have a great tailwind. The trial will continue to be one of the things that people always are going to want or there's a lot more of it. And thus, provide a great service, our job is get a safer share, a bigger piece of that pie that is going to continue to grow. And you grow a little bit faster than global GDP. That's why I believe we have a great future here. And Steve, I don't know what we talked or do not disclose regarding his question regarding apps.\nDavid Goulden: I'll be really quick because we got over time. But there are multiple ways you can book on our property on our platforms directly. You can book directly through the app, book directly on the mobile web and book directly on a desktop or laptop. The app is by far the stickiest those in terms of repeat rates return rates. And of course, the app is where we're kind of designing to optimize the experience around the Connected Trip, because not only do we want you to be able to book all elements through the app, but also goes with you on the trip, that doesn't usually happen when you book and print something on one of the other platforms. So it's very important for us. It's a big effort. It's where the Connected Trip is moving towards. And then what I would just leave you with as a final sort of course, not all customers are created equally and the higher value customers who do more business, where spend more of their total spend with are higher usage of both app and direct by an appreciable amount, compared to the average customer. So the app is very much at the center of that thinking.\nJohn Colantuoni: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And with that, I will hand the call back over to Glenn Fogel for closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you, and good night.\nOperator: This does conclude the conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the third quarter as well as our thoughts for Q4 and the full year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings investor relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call.  Now onto our third quarter results. We are pleased to report 15% room night growth in Q3, which was a few percentage points better than our expectations. Looking at our year-on-year room night growth by region in the third quarter, Asia was up about 35%, Rest of World was up mid-teens, Europe was up low double digits and the U.S. was up low single digits. Compared to 2019, our Q3 global room night growth was 24%. The average booking window at Booking.com expanded in Q3 versus the same period in both 2022 and 2019, and was a bit more expanded versus the prior year periods than it was in Q2. In Q3, our mobile apps represented over half of our total room nights for the first time ever. The Q3 mobile app mix of about 51% was about six percentage points higher than the third quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the third quarter relative to the third quarter of 2022. The Q3 international mix of our total room nights was over 50%, up from about 45% in the third quarter of 2022. The Q3 international mix was in line with 2019 levels, similar to the second quarter. Our cancellation rates in the third quarter were slightly higher than Q3 2022, but were slightly below Q3 2019. Cancellation rates were the same as in Q2. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q3 room night growth was about 24% year-over-year and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 33%, which was a few points higher than Q3 2022. Q3 gross bookings increased 24% year-over-year, or 21% on a constant currency basis. The 24% increase in gross bookings was 9 percentage points higher than the 15% room night increase due to about 4% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, plus about 3 percentage points of positive impact from FX movements, and also due to about 2 percentage points from flight bookings. Our year-over-year ADR growth was negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia and a lower mix of room nights from the U.S. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 7 percentage points year-on-year. Despite the higher ADRs in the third quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star-rating levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the third quarter were up about 57% year-on-year driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the third quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 21% year-over-year, or about 18% on a constant currency basis. Although we had a stronger-than-expected Q3 from a room night and gross bookings perspective, the outperformance versus our expectations was mostly driven by mainly bookings that are for travel in future quarters. As a result, we did not see all of the revenue benefit in Q3 from these incremental bookings. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 was 18.4%, which was lower-than-expected due to this timing effect. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 13% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 50 basis points lower than Q3 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 was about 30 basis points lower than last year, which was a little better than our expectations, driven by the improved performance marketing ROIs. Q3 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 10 basis points compared with last year, a bit better than our expectations. About 51% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q3, up from about 40% in Q3 2022. For the total company, 56% of gross bookings were merchant, up from about 45% in Q3 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 24% year-over-year, which was below our expectation, due to lower personnel and personnel related expenses. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. On a GAAP basis, our more fixed expenses were up 33% year-over-year and included a $90 million accrual in G&A expense for the termination fee related to the acquisition agreement for Etraveli, this accrual was excluded from our non-GAAP results Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion in the third quarter, which was up 24% year-over-year, and would have been up 22% on a constant currency basis. This was also ahead of our expectations. Non-GAAP net income of $2.6 billion in the third quarter resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $72.32 per share, which was up 36% year-over-year. Our average share count in the third quarter was 9% below Q3 2022 and 16% below Q3 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $2.5 billion in the quarter Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash and investments balance of $14.3 billion was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $15.7 billion due to the $2.6 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter, partially offset by the $1.3 billion of free cash flow generated in the third quarter. We repurchased $7.7 billion of our shares through the first three quarters, which represents 8% of our year-end 2022 share count. The repurchases so far this year take our combined authorization down to $16 billion from the total of $24 billion we discussed earlier in the year. Our buyback program takes our share price into account and at current share price levels we expect to spend more on buybacks in Q4 than we did in Q3. We remain comfortable with our ability to complete the full $24 billion of share repurchases within 4 years from when we started the program at the beginning of this year, assuming no major downturn in the travel environment. Now onto our thoughts for the fourth quarter of 2023. In October, we estimate year-over-year room night growth was about 8%, down from 15% in Q3 due in part to a tougher year-on-year compare, as well as the war in the Middle East. When comparing versus 2019, October room night growth was about 20%. Excluding Israel, October room nights grew about 9% versus 2022 and about 22% versus 2019. The 22% growth versus October 2019 excluding Israel is a little lower than the 24% growth we saw in Q3 versus 2019. Looking across our major regions, in October we saw Asia year-on-year growth of room nights without 15%, Europe up about 10%, and the U.S. and Rest of World were down slightly. The impact of the Israel-Hamas war is seen most in the Rest of World growth numbers. Israel on a booker plus inbound travel basis is about 1% of our global room nights. The Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, on a booker basis is about 4% of our global room nights. Globally, we saw a slowdown starting the second week of October due to cancellations and a drop in new bookings after the start of the war in the Middle East. The cancellations we saw that started in the second week of October were concentrated in Israel, but we also saw some impact on travel trends outside of the country as people absorbed the news. We were pleased to see room night growth recover towards the end of the month. Our comments for the fourth quarter make the assumption that room night growth will be up about 9% year-over-year. When comparing versus 2019, this means we expect Q4 room night growth to be about 20%. This outlook assumes that there is no further expansion of the war in the Middle East. We expect Q4 gross bookings to grow about 5% -- points of about 5 points faster than room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a couple points from higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, including some pressure from changes in regional mix, as well as a couple of points from continued flight bookings growth. We expect Q4 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 15%, which would be higher than Q4 last year due to benefits from timing. We expect Q4 marketing expenses as a percentage of bookings -- gross bookings to be slightly lower than last year. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q4 to be slightly higher than last year as we continue to look for opportunities to lean in. We expect Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about in line with last year as the higher merchant gross bookings mix is offset by efficiencies in payments costs. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q4 to grow a couple of points faster year-over-year than it did in the third quarter. Taking all this into account, we'd expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be just over $1.4 billion. Our year-to-date results plus our fourth quarter commentary means that for the full year we expect room nights to grow in the mid-to high-teens year-over-year. We currently expect full year gross bookings growth of over 20% year-on-year. We currently expect revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to increase year-on-year by about 10 basis points, down from our previous expectation for a 20 basis point increase due to higher bookings growth and a longer booking window, which reduce the expected benefit from timing. We continue to expect full year marketing and merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly below 2022, and for our more fixed expenses to grow around 25% year-over-year. We manage our more fixed costs very carefully and continue to expect our more fixed expenses next year to grow at an appreciably lower rate than this year. We continue to expect that our adjusted EBITDA margins will expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our Q3 results, the trends we are seeing into Q4 and with the bookings we have already received for early 2024. We are now [technical difficulty]. Yes, Mark, to answer your question relates a little bit to what Glenn just said. Our upside in the quarter, our room night growth was driven by travel -- expect by stronger travel demand across the peak season and along the booking window. If you remember, we said that coming into Q3, we have exceeded -- we see the booking lengthening of the booking window in Q1, Q2. And therefore we expected fewer last minute bookings in Q3. Well, the last minute bookings in Q3 were a little lower than we would have expected any year when we didn't have that long booking window. But what we got were more bookings for longer periods of time out there. So the booking window actually expanded in Q3. And that created the situation that Glenn talked about where we now looking into the first quarter of next year, because of the strong demand we saw for bookings, a lot of which are outside of the quarter plus the window means that our Q1 on the books situation is much stronger than it has been prior to the current situation. I would also just comment that the over performance we saw versus our expectation was across all different regions, I wouldn't call one region out. We actually did that and we expected in all regions when compared to our guidance, looking at the actual for the quarter for room night growth. Yes, thank you, Glenn. And then, Justin, relative to your question. Yes, we were pleased to see room night growth year-over-year in the U.S market. Don't forget, in the U.S., our room nights are over 30% higher than they were in 2019. So we have made significant strides in terms of advancing our overall position in the U.S., if you compare that with market growth rates are probably more likely recovered versus 2019, not up by 30%. When we think about next year, I don't want to get into too much detail. But I will give you a couple of things to think about. I'd say that when you look across all the regions, if you look at where travel as a percentage of GDP is going to wind up in 2023 compared to where it was in 2019, it still has some recovery, before it fully gets back to the percentage of GDP. It used to be in 2019. So I think that provides upside. I'd also say that, as Glenn said in his comments, and as we see, we do see consumers continue to crack and travel of other discretionary expense items, we don't see any reason why that should change based on current trends. And then also just relative to our own view of the business, we're still committed to our milestones we gave you and said we will continue to grow faster post COVID than we were before on the top line and bottom line and consequently basis, that was 8% bookings on revenue, 8% on bookings, 8% on revenue, 15% earnings per share or constant currency growth rates in 2019. And whilst we're not talking about even specific, around 2024, we are still sticking to those overall guidelines and outlooks. Nope, nope. Thank you. That was great. Yes, Lloyd, I'd add a couple of comments. So first of all, just to kind of pick up on what Glenn lets off on the leading in. We are leading into a recovery marketplace. I said, there's still on one of my other answers, there's so some recovery of travel as a percentage of GDP post-COVID left tap into 2024. We haven't seen it fully recover yet. So there are still opportunities to do that. You'll notice though, that we are in lower spending more on marketing, merchandising, in 2023, than we did in 2019. We are getting leverage relative to what we spent in 2022. As a couple things happen. One as our direct mix increases, and of course mobile is highly correlated to direct mix. The majority, the vast majority of all our mobile -- of all of that mobile app bookings are in fact direct bookings, so that helps as well. So and then you did make a reference, I would just say to Q4, and I wouldn't read too much into Q4. Here's how I would explain why we expect to get some deleverage in marketing in Q4, relative to the other quarter where we've shown leverage. It's really quite simple. We're having a strong year, and we decided to invest in some additional programs in Q4 that will help us finish the year well. And to build on our momentum going into 2024. So that was us. It's very conscious. Again, we are not going to go into the playbook in terms of what they are or where they are, but we recognize that we're doing well this year financially, delivering great EBITDA and results. So we are leaning a little bit in Q4 to position us well, the first year and going to 2024 strong. Again, that's what we are doing. Not driven by any [indiscernible] in the marketplace is our conscious decision. Of course, we'll still create leverage on marketing merchandising for the full year. Yes, Doug, I mean, the 2024 conversation, we're going to have that when we get into February next year, I really don't want to have -- how that now. We've told you a little bit about the strength of the on the books in the first quarter given the strength of bookings in the booking window. And we talked a little bit about our framework for growth post-COVID hasn't changed. So I want to keep anything beyond that until we get to see a little bit more. We are talking to you next time, of course, we'll give you much more insight at that point in time. But it's too early to talk about the specifics of line items in the income statement in 2024. I can talk about where we are with some of the customer oriented dynamics around there, Eric, I think will be helpful. So we said this is about Booking.com, which is of course where Air is still relatively new and growing very rapidly. We said previously that over 20% of Air customers are brand new to us. We've never seen them before, that continues to be the case, as the business grows, which is very, very healthy. We also see that those new customers who are booking Air [Indiscernible] who've never booked anything prior to that with us, are doing a healthy attachment rate from into accommodation because these are brand-new customers. So you wouldn't expect that attachment ratio to be all that high, but it's quite healthy. Not quite as high as examples of what we're doing with Priceline where we've been doing that for many years. But it's certainly an encouraging attachment rate. What I would tell you, though, on the other side, of course, by definition, most of the air that we are selling is to existing customers, which you would expect. And there is a very good attach rate on those air tickets to accommodation because these customers know us from an a combination background in the first place. What I would also say is that we still have good data that says that customers who buy multiple things from us, whether they be the new customers or the existing customers buying air and the combination. We have good data that says that, that will drive better frequency, loyalty, future basket size, getting them kind of up that loyalty and frequency curve that we talked about to the higher value customers. So the dynamics around air are still healthy and they haven't changed. We are encouraged about them. And as you can see, they're helping us in multiple different ways. Yes, I will talk a little bit about a framework for post-COVID recovery because I think that's important. So we've committed that when the dust settles and the market goes back to normal growth rates, whenever that is, we'll be a larger and faster-growing business. Delivering more EPS and faster-growing EPS than we did before. So larger and faster growing on the top line and the bottom line. So why do we think that is the case? Well, we will have made a ton of progress. So the comparison point is 2019. If 2024 is the year that we get to normalized growth rates, it will be 5 years later. If it's 2025, it will be 6 years later. But the business is so fundamentally different in, the business we had in 2019. I think we need just to step back and remind you of that. So, what we've done since 2019 and mainly around Booking.com, but other parts of the business have also contributed as well. Back then, we were mainly, an accommodation mainly hotel, mainly agency business. So since then, we have added a significant alternative accommodation business, which is now very sizable and now we're trying to be for growing quickly.

We've now developed a big merchandising arm and capability, but also we've refined our performance marketing tools to the level where we really think we can lean into recurring marketplaces and gain share more aggressively than we did back then. And then, of course, we've added our Genius program and enhanced it significantly. So we believe that we have made huge strides since 2019, which is our comparison point when we grew at 8% on the top line, constant currency bookings and revenue. And of course, this year, we are going to be a lot bigger than we were in 2019. But you add all those capabilities together, and we believe we have a fundamentally different and more competitive business that's providing more value to our customers and partners and is much, much for towards the vision of the Connected Trip than we had back then. And that's why we are confident that we can grow faster and have a bigger business that grows faster on the top line and the bottom line than we had in 2019. That is the framework. I'll be really quick because we got over time. But there are multiple ways you can book on our property on our platforms directly. You can book directly through the app, book directly on the mobile web and book directly on a desktop or laptop. The app is by far the stickiest those in terms of repeat rates return rates.

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I'm encouraged by the strong results we are reporting today and by the strong leisure travel demand environment that we continue to see. In the third quarter, our traveler customers booked 276 million, or more than a quarter of a billion room nights, which was an increase of 15% year-over-year, and we had gross bookings of $40 billion, which was an increase of 24% year-over-year. Room night growth versus 2019 was 24% in Q3. Both room nights and gross bookings were record quarterly amounts for the company, and both came in ahead of our previous expectations. Third quarter revenue of $7.3 billion grew 21% and adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion increased 24%, both versus Q3 last year, and both exceeded our prior expectations. Finally, our non-GAAP earnings per share in the quarter grew 36% year-over-year, and was nearly 60% higher than in the third quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share growth benefited from our improved profit levels, as well as our strong capital return program, which reduced our end-of-quarter share count by 10% versus the third quarter of 2022. Now, turning to October, we estimate that room night growth was about 8% year-over-year and about 20% versus 2019. Excluding Israel, we estimate these growth rates would have been about 9% and 22%, respectively. We saw a significant negative impact on our business in Israel, and there was some impact on travel trends outside of Israel. Nevertheless, we were encouraged to see global room night growth improve towards the end of the month. And David will explain more about October in his remarks. Overall, we continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand. And as we take a very early look ahead to 2024, we see strong growth on the books for travel that will take place in the first quarter of next year, though a high percentage of these bookings are cancellable. Given current trends, we expect customers and consumers will continue to prioritize travel over other discretionary spend in 2024. I firmly believe we are well-positioned to continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform, while making progress on several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long-term. These initiatives include: one, advancing our connected trip vision. 2, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, 3; continuing to grow alternative accommodations, and four, building more direct relationships with our traveler customers. Starting with the Connected Trip: this is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. In the third quarter, we saw an increase in the percentage of transactions which we count as connected trips, meaning two or more travel components within a trip. Though still a small percentage of our total transactions today, it is encouraging to see an increasing number of our travelers booking more elements of their travel with us. Outside of accommodations, one of the most important elements of travel is flights, and we continue to focus on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com. In the third quarter, air tickets booked increased 57% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering. To provide some context on how this has developed over the last few years, the 9 million tickets booked on our platforms during the third quarter were more than 5x the number of air tickets booked through us in Q3 2019. This significant growth of our flight offering at Booking.com over the last 4 years was achieved through our successful partnership with Etraveli. As previously announced, our proposed acquisition of Etraveli was blocked by the European Commission in September, a decision we will appeal. While we strongly disagree with the EC's decision to block the deal, our commitment to building the flight vertical at Booking.com has not changed. In fact, we have extended our partnership agreement with Etraveli through at least the end of 2028, which means we anticipate continuing to work with them on improving Booking.com's flight offering over the coming years. We believe offering a compelling flight product alongside our accommodation, ground transportation, and attractions offerings, helps to create a better, easier, and more comprehensive travel booking experience for our travelers, and more opportunities for our partners. We will continue to build out our Connected Trip vision, which we believe will ultimately result in increased customer and supplier engagement with our platform. As we discussed last quarter, we have always envisioned AI technology at the center of the Connected Trip, and we have a long history of investing in AI technology and incorporating it in our platforms across our company. I previously spoke about the hard work our teams have been doing to integrate Generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Priceline's generative AI travel assistant, named Penny, and Booking.com's AI Trip Planner. It is still very early days, but both teams are gaining valuable insights on booker questions, concerns, and behavior as the tools continue to interact with customers. At Priceline, we are seeing some encouraging signs of lower customer service contact rates, and we are exploring other areas across our business where we believe we can use generative AI tools to increase productivity For example, our brands are running projects using generative AI to enhance the productivity of our software developers with encouraging results so far. And we look forward to using these tools more widely in the future. I remain confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI developments by improving our products for our customers and operating more efficiently over time. Turning to our supply partners: we strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, and we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. During the quarter, some of our partners at Booking.com experienced delayed payments due to a planned upgrade to our finance and payment platforms in early July. We have now cleared the backlog of outstanding payment issues related to this system upgrade. We plan to provide compensation to partners who experienced an extended delay, and we recorded this in our Q3 results. We plan to communicate to all partners who were impacted by these payment delays within the next few days We continue to focus on strengthening our alternative accommodations offering at Booking.com by increasing supply and raising awareness among travelers. In the third quarter, alternative accommodation room nights grew at about 24% year-over-year, which was faster than our traditional hotel category. Alternative accommodations represented about 33% of Booking.com's total room nights, which was 3 percentage points higher than in Q3 2022. We are seeing continued momentum in terms of alternative accommodations supply growth both globally and in the U.S., with global listings reaching about 7.2 million by the end of the third quarter, which is about 9% higher than Q3 last year. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increasing loyalty, frequency, spend, and direct relationships over time. In the third quarter, our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continued to increase year-over-year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. For the first time ever for our company, over 50% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the third quarter, which is about 6 percentage points higher than in Q3 2022. This is a remarkable achievement considering the mix of our mobile app room nights in the third quarter of 2019 was about 18 percentage points lower than it was in the third quarter this year. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong third quarter results and the continued resilience of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well for the long-term. We continue our work to deliver a better offering and experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We are confident in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. Hi, Mark. I was not saying that I see more than I normally do. I'm just saying I was very pleased to see this resiliency in global leisure travel demand and saying that we're looking at 2024, we're seeing strong growth on the books for travel. And that's going to happen in the first quarter. So it's just reinforcing my belief that travel is healthy. And we're looking forward to continue healthy travel. So, Justin, hello. And I have been talking about the Connected Trip for a while, because I do believe that really is a differentiator in the long run, and why someone would come to us and continue to come to us rather than another way to do their travel. So in the long run, of course, if somebody's coming direct, because they really enjoy the way we do it versus an alternative that of course, the lower the marketing cost, you wouldn't have to reacquire that, that customer. It's interesting because the small send small data, but we do see people who book more than one element with us currently, we do see some benefits the person coming back more frequently, and a higher direct. So I like that. And I think we can do a lot more with them. Now, one of the things that we're not the only person doing this, of course, in this competition, because I think a lot of people see this. And now, on top of this, the whole benefits of generative AI, along with all the AI work we've been doing for a long time. And we see the potential to create a much better experience in discovery, planning and executing your travel in a way that if we do this, right, we may be able to greatly accelerate the growth of the company, because it really is transformationally different versus just incrementally different. And that's what we're striving for. Now, that's not going to happen tomorrow, you know that I know that it's not going to happen next week, next quarter. Not going to happen next year. It's going to take time to get all this built out. But what I'm really pleased about is seeing historically, we said what we're going to do, and we've been doing it, and we're showing markers along the way, hitting milestones, hitting a slight growth rate still, 57% of air ticket booking I talked about talking about, that's 5x greater than 2019. We said we're going to do it, and we did it, and we're going forward. In so many of these other areas where I believe that people are frustrated in the way they travel now. We can do it better. We'll achieve great things, both for the traveler, of course. We're going to achieve great opportunities for our partners to give them more opportunities to get more business working with us. And then of course, together those things will end up with a great derivative, which is more value for the shareholders. That's what we're trying to do. And I'm really pleased to where we are. So, Kevin, why don't I start and David can add on anything I fail to add in. Obviously, very, very pleased with that number. That's a really good growth rate. And when we compare it to some other people in the space, I'm very impressed by what we've been able to accomplish. And I will shout out to the whole team that works on alternative accommodations. But there's some again. I've been talking about for some time about, we need to improve the product, we need to make people aware of it. And by doing that, we'll get more business. And that's what we've been doing. Now I can do all the things I've talked about them in the past, and we continue to do things to make it a better product. And there's still a lot of things that need to be done to make it even better. And that's what we're going to keep on doing. There's no magic bullet. No, no silver bullet and tell, here's how it came about. It comes through a lot of hard work and a lot of different ways of just grinding away, cranking out making it better talking with the suppliers who have these properties, making sure we're marketing appropriately when people want that property, they can find it and they see it. All those things together will enable us to achieve what I think was a very, very good print on the growth rate there. But I'll tell you, we're not there yet. And I mentioned look, I want to increase the supply a lot more look, it's great. 9% increase. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks and the increase up to 7.2 billion listings. That's great. That's good. But I know there are a lot of areas we need to add even more, particularly in the United States, because that's the place that I want to use our product. Because if I look for anything, and I don't see it. Well, to me, that's upside down. We're doing great right now. And I still see so much opportunity ahead because for example, we don't have enough properties in certain areas and other product features that we need to improve upon. All together. I look at this great opportunity. We're going to well, and we will do it even better in the future. I hope and David, anything specific to add to that? Okay. Yes, sure. Thank you, Brian. So, the U.S is not that much different than any other geography in terms of the elements that help create growth are providing a better product. Enabling people to be able to find the properties they want, at the right price, and the easiest thing to do and if anything goes wrong, given great customer service. That's the playbook. And yes, I -- some of the numbers look a little funky. And of course, COVID is really create all sorts of things, different geographies come out faster than others. So you're comparing a year-over-year, and maybe it looks like a deceleration and then there's domestic and international events, I think a good way to look those like compare back to 2019. And the fact is, we've achieved, we've accomplished some great things in terms of increasing our share in the U.S. And we keep on doing what we have been doing. And that will continue to increase that share. And I just mentioned in the previous question about our alternative accommodations, which is important part of growing out of the U.S. And another thing is also you mentioned Genius. So I'll switch over to there. -- and that is continue to develop the Genius program in a way that continues to provide not only great value to the traveler, which of course, is an obvious one, but it's providing opportunity for our partners to be able to get incremental demand when they need it, where they need and how they need it. Working that together is a way for us to provide a better opportunity for both sides of this marketplace to achieve greater value for both sides. And I think that we have that great thing, layer on all those other things we talk about with the whole idea of the Connected Trip. Bring in more of the Generative AI stuff. And altogether, I think this is a good playbook to try and continue to grow our share in the U.S. And again, we've been doing it for some time now. So I'm really pleased with where we stand. So Lloyd, let me talk a little bit about this and all we do and add other facts that he wants to add in here. And I want to be very careful here. Obviously, the one thing I don't want to do is give away our [indiscernible] ideas and all the things we're going to play with our competitors listening in on this. So you'll understand it, while it'll be a little bit general in this. But one of the things I continue to try and talked to the team about is we need to be nimble. We need to be agile, and we need to be able to be smart and move into markets, where we see opportunities and pull back in other places where we think we're not going to get the right ROIs. Whether that be a geography, whether it be a channel, would that be developing a entire product, whatever it is, I don't look at any of these in a different way. I look at all together holistically. What we're trying to do to achieve growth at the right type of profitability levels. And we're going to continue to do that. Right now, as David said, we have a lean-in position because we see opportunity here. Time can -- these things can change depending on the time. And certainly, the idea is to say I'm going to do this for a long-term period is it's a nice thing to say, but who knows what the world is going to be like, and as we all see, unfortunately, the world can change very, very rapidly. So we'll continue to do this, and this is our profile right now the way David explained those numbers for what we are going to disclose right now. But you should always recognize that we have an overall view of how to do things, but we will be willing to change, depending on circumstances. Regarding the mobile app, I talked about, David, why don't you just take in terms of how that will apply to our numbers going forward. I will let David talk about what you wants to [indiscernible]. I don't think we talked about 2024. I think we talked first quarter. I will let David, clarify whatever he wants to clarify. Hi, Lee. Well, you won't be surprised, I'm not actually going to give out the details exactly how and what level and what amount of money we're going to put to work out and what the methods are. I will say that the best way to look at this and look at what we've done historically. And where the numbers have been going and how the growth has been going. That's the best indication for you in terms of thinking forward, how -- what we're going to end up in result, and the results going to be. I will say that it's fairly obvious to be looked at our site and tries to find homes in certain properties and in certain parts of the U.S., you can see perhaps you don't have enough of them in those areas. So it would not be illogical to think that's where we'll start going to. As we talked in the past, we think that there is a lower hanging fruit for us in properties that are controlled or managed by larger groups of properties, makes it easier for us to get that. So I'm not giving anything away here. When I say, well, we'll let us go there first, and let's be sure we're doing that. And for example, you may have noticed that recently started doing the request on demand type of thing, where a person doesn't automatically be able to book instantly. And that's a product improvement because some people in, let's say, higher quality or higher value properties. Perhaps the owner or the manager did not want to have an instant booking and want to have a chance to do it on request basis. So that's an improvement thing. So we'll continue to roll out all these different things that we think will make our property -- our product as good as anybody else's, it applies the money to the appropriate marketing to make sure people are aware of it, and that will enable us to continue the growth that we've seen so far, I hope. I'm not sure the term premium growth, I'll just say, well, we talked a little bit about, look, we talked some time about different geographies coming back faster in other areas. Asia was certainly the one who was last. And of course, it looks good when you're starting to see the, nice growth rate those regions as the other ones start getting more normalized. It's a nice thing to say. It's certainly outbound for example, outbound China still significantly behind, when you look at any of the industry reports, and think how much lift do they have going out bond, et cetera. Although that's a small part of our business, not going to make a huge difference even when it starts to come back. So overall, look, we love to see that Asia is going to get back to where all the other parts of the world are -- and I really do and I understand the term premium that you mentioned, maybe explain that I could give a better explanation. Oh, faster. Okay. I thought maybe you're talking about more expensive travel or something? Okay, got it. Sorry. Thank you. I will let David handle that last part. In terms of the appeal, the appeal will take some time. This type of court action is not going to happen overnight. I can't tell you exactly how long it will take, but it's not going to happen anytime soon. So I would not put anything in terms of what that will mean for [indiscernible] in the relative future. However, we do like the fact that we do have this new agreement with Etraveli, going out to 2028. That's really great. Also, as you know, it's not just booked many travel line. That's one area of our air business. We have Priceline. Of course, that's that company started Priceline or as an Air product. That was the first product. We have lots of good relationships with air travel there. I obviously am very disappointed by the European Commission's blocking, what I believe would have been an extremely beneficial transaction for the travelers, good for them, were they good for the partners, good for them. And together, this will create value, which, of course, would have come back to all the people involved in the company, whether they be for higher value for our shareholders, a higher value for our employees working on , et cetera. Very disappointing decision, we moved on. We will continue to develop this product. And by the way, it's been growing very nicely even though we didn't actually have possession of Etraveli, and yet, we still were able to reduce 57% increase in air tickets. David, I'll let you if you want to talk anything about basket size and things around if you do. Okay. AI. We only have so much time because I could go on for a long time on this, so I'll try and concise my thoughts on this. So as in all new technologies, the hype is always great, very beginning or [indiscernible] thing is going to be the greatest thing some slice bread, but then it takes longer than it takes to toast a slice to actually haven't needed. That's the thing about what we are seeing is that it's really exciting. I absolutely believe it's going to be transformative, but it's going to take a long time. And when I said in my prepared remarks about this is very early, it is very, very early. Now some of the stuff that we are seeing and that we have done enough so we see some data to see there are going to be some good benefits. So the example of the customer service example is, for example, you have a customer service agent, who actually is able to use a copilot, let's call it, with AI agent that helps enable that customers or agent answer the question or taking action much faster, than they would have been able to do previously. Particularly in terms of a number of years, the person has been a CS agent and maybe a CS agent has been there forever. They're instant how do everything perfectly is great and all that. But if you're a relatively new CS agent, this is going to be extremely healthy for that person. As you know, the turnover of CS agents is very great because there's a good efficiency productivity game there. Then everybody, I'm sure, has read lots about how coding can be greatly increased in terms of speed and efficiency, using some of these copilots in terms of coating. So there's another area, again, early stages, just seeing it, but we do believe that is going to do something like that. And then you go on into the things that we have for the customer. And the things like Priceline and their Penny product. We're a customer when they're about to buy something, there's a chatbot where they can put in a question because they get not sure they want to buy or not. And instead of having to go all the way back up the funnel to find the information they say, do they want to buy or not, using that chatbot, they can be instantly given an answer that will help convert that person into a buy much faster and actually not losing as much. And questions be everything one of the things that I've noticed is coming a lot is, can I bring my dog to the hotel. And actually, it can become quite a conversational type thing where, yes, you can't bring your dog and so, but my dog is a very big dog. How big is your dog and if you go back [indiscernible] that's using our information that we have -- that's all our current end using an LLM in combination [indiscernible] this type of chat relationship. That's really good. And then you can go to the other things, we're in the Booking.com AI product, which is really trying to create an itinerary, the discovery from the very top and going down. And then when it offers hotels, it integrates with our hotel condos [ph], you can book right data also very good. Now both those things relatively small usage of any of these things compared to the overall size of the amount of inquiries we get a number of bookings, we do in terms of the overall size of the company. But it's very encouraging that this stuff really does matter, and it's going to make a difference. Now the question would be how long until we get sort of that hit that inflection point, where people start saying, \"oh, this is so much better. I don't know that yet. But we're going to keep on experimenting on all these things, increasing the efficiencies. So we can do things faster with a lower cost and at the same time, increasing things for the travelers to make sure they want to come and use our products and our services versus anybody else's. That's the plan right now, and I like it. And David, I'm not sure what the second question was. Let me just take that last one, and then I'll let Dave. I'm not sure what we disclose and what we don't disclose about your first question. Obviously, it's an important one. So we say -- and we've said this several times, several quarters [indiscernible], the same question keeps coming up in different forms of -- do we see any softening? Do we see anything decline? Do we see a decrease in star rating? Do you see a decrease in length of stay and things like that. We say no. And that's what we'll be -- no and no. In terms of why we believe that discretionary spending will continue to travel versus other things, that's obviously a lot of the survey. So I can maybe a whole bunch of things that are independent, third-party actual people are saying they're going to do etcetera. Here's something more important though. And I really try and stress this is how important the long is in terms of how we think about the business and increasing value. So if we agree that over time, GDP for the world will continue to increase and per capita GDP will continue to increase. It's fairly logical that as people get wealthier, they're going to spend more of their money on things that are services or experiences than they are things. Once you going rich enough to have, let's say an apartment, you have one apartment in generally or you have one sofa. You're not going to buy a sofa each year. What you're going to do is you need to get more money is you will travel either more frequently or in a higher level of style travel or you'll do both. And we see that over and over again, when you go look at countries and you see what the amount of the -- ease to look at his international travel, which is a higher I think you know that's going to be a higher level for some people. And you see, as the GDP for a person there goes up. You see the amount of going outbound travel increases, too. So that's why I believe that this is in the long run. We have a great tailwind. The trial will continue to be one of the things that people always are going to want or there's a lot more of it. And thus, provide a great service, our job is get a safer share, a bigger piece of that pie that is going to continue to grow. And you grow a little bit faster than global GDP. That's why I believe we have a great future here. And Steve, I don't know what we talked or do not disclose regarding his question regarding apps. Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you, and good night."

And now, I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report that in the second quarter we continue to see robust leisure travel demand which helped drive the strong results we are announcing today. The 268 million room nights booked in the second quarter increased by 9% year-over-year and gross bookings of $39.7 billion grew 15% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly gross bookings ever. Both room nights and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the favorable demand environment. Revenue growth of 27% in Q2 also nicely outperformed our expectations. The strong top line results in the quarter combined with better-than-expected marketing efficiency helped drive our Q2 adjusted EBITDA to about $1.8 billion which is an increase of 64% versus Q2 last year, and meaningfully exceeded our prior growth expectations of about 35%. Looking at the month of July we have seen an acceleration in year-over-year room night growth relative to the 9% growth we reported for Q2. We estimate July room nights increased by about 20% year-over-year benefiting from the easier comparison to July 2022. Overall, we have been very pleased to see our strong performance in the first half of the year which has benefited from the continued strength and resiliency of overall travel demand. Our solid start to the year combined with what we currently believe will be a new all-time high for Q3 summer travel period results and an improved outlook for the full year which David will discuss in detail in his comments. While the near-term results and outlook are encouraging we remain focused on what is important for the business for the long term which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our enterprise while simultaneously remaining cost conscious. We are seeing progress and momentum across several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long term. These initiatives include advancing our Connected Trip vision, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, continuing to grow alternative accommodations, and building more direct relationships with our travel bookers. Starting with the Connected Trip: this is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. To be clear, this is not a discrete product we will introduce at some point in the future, instead this is a meaningfully enhanced way for a booker to experience and utilize Booking.com. Over time you will see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform that move us another step closer to this long-term vision, and importantly, this approach allows us to realize benefits while we are building towards that future state. We believe that the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented, and frustrating to travelers than it should be and, eventually, our Connected Trip vision will greatly improve it via technology. Looking at the other side of the travel marketplace, we believe that our supplier partners will also benefit greatly from the Connected Trip as it will provide more opportunities to personalize and merchandise their offerings. We continue to build out our Connected Trip vision and have much more work to do, but we are pleased with the progress we have seen so far and expect it to ultimately result in increased customer and supplier engagement with our platform.  We have always envisioned the Connected Trip as having AI technology at its center. Across our company, we have a long history with investing in AI technology and incorporating it into our platforms in order to optimize interactions with both our travelers and partners. This is an area where we believe we are well positioned given we have built strong teams of AI experts and gained valuable experience from using AI extensively for years. In addition to the many current applications for AI on our platforms, we believe that we can build an even more compelling and differentiated offering for our bookers if we can leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience: A Connected Trip that would be more responsive to a booker\u2019s needs and help manage different aspects of their trips. Generative AI may play an important role in delivering that Connected Trip experience to our bookers, and our teams have been hard at work to integrate this exciting technology into our offerings in innovative ways, for example, In early July, Priceline unveiled its 2023 Summer Release, which delivered over 40 new booking tools and upgrades, including Penny. Penny is Priceline\u2019s generative AI travel assistant. Priceline has currently positioned Penny at the \u201cend-of-the-funnel\u201d on the checkout page where Penny can answer travel related questions that a customer may have when they have reached the checkout page. Penny is built on Priceline\u2019s own proprietary technology and data, and also leverages large language model technology to power its conversational capabilities. The combination of these technologies allows for innovations like the ability to make a booking directly in the chat interface. The Priceline team is rapidly gaining insights on booker questions, concerns, and behavior as Penny continues to interact with customers. The plan is to further enhance Penny over time by leveraging those valuable learnings. Around the same time as Priceline\u2019s Summer Release, Booking.com launched its own AI Trip Planner, which began rolling out on the mobile app in the US to Genius customers. In contrast to Penny the AI trip planner sits towards the top of the funnel, where travelers are in the discovery and planning processes for their trips. Built upon the foundation of Booking.com's existing machine learning models that recommend accommodation options to millions of travelers on the platform every day the AI trip planner is also partially powered by large language mall technology to create a conversational experience for people to start their planning processes. The AI trip planner advances planning by providing travelers with a rich visual list of destinations and properties including Booking.com's live pricing information with deep links to view more details on the options. From the chat interface of the AI trip planner bookers can tap on any recommended accommodation they're interested in and then complete the reservation. Accretive to our approach here is to marry our own proprietary data and machine learning models with degenerative AI technology. This allows us to provide a conversational interface with the traveler while leveraging our own recommendation engine to provide accurate detail and real-time information on the property recommendations. Like Priceline, the Booking.com team is already gaining valuable insights from the interactions with bookers even though the trip planner is in beta and is still currently in a relatively limited rollout. While we are excited by these new advances at Booking.com and Priceline it is of course still very early days and we have much more to learn about how customers will ultimately want to interact with this new technology. In addition, we mentioned last quarter that [indiscernible] like Kayak were Experian [ph] with AI plug-ins. And we will continue to examine all areas of our company to ensure we are taking advantage of AI-created efficiencies. We are confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI development and improve our products for our customers given our many years' experience in AI our travel-related data and connections to our supply partners and our human and financial capital. Across our businesses, we have two equally important customers our travelers and our supply partners with each representing one side of our marketplace. For our supply partners, we strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform and we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental demand in developing products and features to help support their businesses. One area of focus for us on the supply side continues to be our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com. Alternative accommodation room nights grew faster than our traditional hotel category at about 11% year-over-year for the second quarter and represented about 34% of Booking.com's total room nights, which is two percentage points higher than in Q2 2022. This is a new all-time high mix of our total room nights. We are pleased to see continued momentum in terms of alternative accommodation of supply growth both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about $7 million by the end of the second quarter which is about 8% higher than Q2 last year. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product for our supply partners and travelers particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. In the second quarter, our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continue to increase year-over-year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and we believe will result in increased traveler loyalty. About 48% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the second quarter which is about six percentage points higher than in Q2 2022 an acceleration in the mix shift compared to Q1 and all-time high in terms of mix of bookings coming from our mobile apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strength of travel demand so far this year and signs of what we expect to be a record summer travel season. Our teams continue to innovate and execute well against our key strategic priorities which helps us position our business well for the long-term. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the second quarter as well as our thoughts for Q3 and for the full year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019, where we think these are helpful. Information, regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website, after the conclusion of the earnings call. Now on to our second quarter results, again it's a tough year-over-year comparison in the second quarter, due to a strong rebound in travel after Omicron in Q2 last year. We were pleased to have blurred 9% room night growth in Q2 which was a few percentage points better than our expectations. Looking at our year-over-year room night growth by region in the second quarter, Asia was up over 40%. Rest of world was up low-double digits. Europe was up a couple of points and the US was down slightly. It's helpful to remember that the US was very strong last Q2 and stronger than Q1 and Q3 versus 2019 due to a rebound from Omicron. Compared to 2019, our Q2 global room night growth was 26% which was in line with Q1. For the second quarter, all our major regions grew at a similar rate versus 2019. In Q2, the booking window of Booking.com expanded further versus 2019 than it did in Q1. The Q2 booking window of Booking.com also expanded versus 2022. As Glenn mentioned, our mobile apps represented about 48% of our total room nights in the quarter, which was about six percentage points higher than the second quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increased mix of our room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2022. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic, in Q2, we saw the international mix of our room nights fully recover to 2019 levels. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter were higher than Q2 2022 as the second quarter of 2022, benefited from the strong recovery in new bookings following the relaxation of travel restrictions in many parts of the world post-Omicron. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter continue to be below 2019 levels. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q2 room night growth was about 11% year-over-year and the global mix of our tag recombination room it was about 34% which was higher than about 32% in Q2 2022 versus 2019, alternative combination room night growth was about 38%. Q2 gross bookings increased 15% year-over-year, or 16% on a constant currency basis. The 15% increase in gross bookings was six points higher than the 9% room night increase due to 5% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple points from flight bookings, partially offset by the one percentage point of negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia and a lower mix of room nights from the US. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about nine percentage points year-over-year. Despite the higher ADRs in the second quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star-rating levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up about 58% year-over-year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com\u2019s Flight offering. Revenue for the second quarter came in nicely ahead of our expectations, increasing 27% year-over-year, or about 28% on a constant currency basis. Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points above last year, which was about in line with our expectations. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 4% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 50 basis points lower than Q2 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 was about 60 basis points lower than last year, which was better than our expectation. Relative to our expectation, this was primarily due to better ROIs in our paid channels, as well as lower than expected merchandising spend, which was impacted by the booking window being more expanded than we expected in the quarter which will push merchandising expense into future periods at the time revenue is recognized. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 30 basis points compared with last year, a bit better than our expectation. About 48% of Booking.com\u2019s gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q2, up from about 38% in Q2 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 20% year-over-year, which was below our expectation due to lower IT expenses in the quarter, including some impact from phasing of IT spend into later in the year. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion in the second quarter, which was up 64% year-over-year, and would have been up 70% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was well above our expectation due to the stronger topline, the efficiencies in marketing and merchandising, and lower than expected IT expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA margins increased by about 7 percentage points versus Q2 2022. Non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion in the second quarter resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $37.62 per share, which was up 97% year-over-year. Our average share count in the second quarter was 9% below Q2 2022 and 15% below Q2 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $1.3 billion in the quarter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $15.7 million was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $15.3 billion due to the $1.9 billion of debt issuances in May 2023 and the $1.6 billion of free cash flow generated in the second quarter offset by the $3.1 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter. In the first half of the year, we repurchased $5.1 billion of our shares, which represented 5% and of our year end 2022 share count. The repurchases so far this year take our combined authorization down to $19 billion from the $24 billion we discussed earlier in the year. We remain comfortable with our ability to complete the full $24 billion of share repurchases within four years from when we started the program at the beginning of this year assuming no major downturn in the travel environment. Now on to our thoughts for the third quarter of 2023. In July, we saw year-over-year room night growth of about 20% up from 9% in Q2. Looking across our major regions, in July we saw Asia up about 45%; rest of World up over 20%; Europe up mid-teens; and the US up mid single-digits. When comparing versus 2019 July room night growth was in a similar range to the 26% growth in Q2. The US was our most recovered region with growth at over 30% versus 2019. Our comments for the third quarter made the assumption that room night growth will be up low double digits year-on-year assuming some moderation in growth from July due in part to harder prior year comparables in August and September. You'll recall from our commentary on the third quarter of 2022 that room night growth versus 2019 was 4% in July 2022 and 10% in August and September 2022. In addition, we expect that due to expanded booking window in the first half of the year stayed in Q3, but there will be fewer last-minute bookings for stays in the rest of Q3. We expect Q3 gross bookings to grow about seven points faster the room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and a few points of positive impact from FX movements. We expect accommodation constant currency ADRs to be about in line with Q3 2022 including a couple of points of pressure from the changes in regional mix. We expect Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be around 19% slightly above last year due to a more positive impact from timing in part due to the expanded booking window in the first half of this year and from increased revenue from payments. We expect these will be partially offset by a higher mix of flights and increased merchandising spend some of which is related to bookings we received earlier in the year. We expect Q3 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 to be slightly lower than last year. We expect Q3 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 20 basis points higher last year primarily due to higher gross bookings mix. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q3 to grow year-over-year about 30% due to higher personnel and related expenses, higher IT expenses including the impact of phasing from Q2, and higher indirect taxes in G&A. The year-over-year growth in our more fixed expenses includes about seven percentage points from changes in FX. The difference between the 20% growth in our more fixed expenses in Q2 and a 30% growth in Q3 is driven mainly by FX and major one. Taking all into account, we expect adjusted -- we expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be around 20% higher than last year. Given the strong level of bookings that we've seen, we are updating our commentary for the full year. We currently expect gross bookings to grow slightly over 20%, up from our previous expectation for low teens growth. We expect full year room night growth in the mid-teens and constant currency combination ADRs were up slightly for the year, including a couple of points of pressure from changes in regional mix. We currently expect revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to increase year-over-year by about 20 basis points down from our previous expectation of 50 basis points increase. The reduction in our full year take rate is driven by less of a benefit from timing including due to the higher growth rate we expected earlier in this year and also due to expanded booking window. Also, from stronger performance, which drove a higher mix of flights than expected earlier in the year. We currently expect marketing merchandising, as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly below in 2022 as compared to our previous expectation for it to be similar to 2022. The improvements in our expectation is driven primarily by higher ROIs in off paid channels. We currently expect our more fixed expenses to grow about 25% up from our previous expectation to around 20%. The increase in our expectation is driven primarily by variable components of personnel expense due to the overperformance versus expectations at the start of the year as well as higher indirect taxes which are generally tied to revenues and some additional FX pressure. We manage our more fixed expenses very carefully and continue to expect our more fixed expenses next year to grow at an appreciably lower rate than this year. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our year-to-date results and the momentum in the business that we moved into Q3. We'll now move to Q&A. Adam, can you please open the lines? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open. \nLloyd Walmsley: Great. Thanks. Two if I can. First thanks for some of the color on the Gen AI trip planners you guys have rolled out. Wondering how you guys think about that strategically and balance that with what search engines are doing. Do you think this brings you guys more direct traffic, or do you think when you look at what some other players like Google are doing with their new search experience like how that might change traffic flows in the travel space? And then second one you mentioned marketing ROI improvements and efforts to improve efficiency. Is that a function of just making higher ROI targets or just other changes you're making within marketing? Any commentary you can give there would be great. Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel : Lloyd, why don't I take the first one about AI and then I'll let David talk about marketing and ROIs. So first and while it's an easy answer, it's the true answer, which is nobody knows yet how there's a very new technology generative AI how that's going to play out in the long run. That's one. Two, even though we don't know how it's going to come out, we know it's very important that we continue to do everything we can to explore experiment see what might be very helpful to our travelers and to our supply partners too along with internally to do things better internally for us. Every company is doing that including the big search engines like Google and they're coming out what they can do and nobody knows. A couple of things though I am fairly certain that history provides a good road map. And that is there will be changes but companies that are able to adapt quickly be agile have great technology experts will benefit from these kinds of changes. We saw it as things for example like when the mobile for came out, we were able to adapt quickly adjust and we got I think a very good advantage from that. I think that we will hopefully get the same type of benefits as this new technology Generate AI comes out. But one thing I didn't mention in the prepared remarks was, I mentioned all the companies, but I didn't mention Agoda. So Agoda is doing some very good things in terms of internally how can we use Gen AI to become more efficient with all types of code co-pilot type systems. So there are lots of different things that we're playing with all one. I'm really happy the way that we're doing from different directions having price line doing it at the bottom of the phone see how that works. Doing Booking.com's AI Trip Planner tops how that's doing that. The ChatGPT plug-ins from open table and from Kaya. So being able to do all these things from the different brands and being able to learn from each other, what works, what doesn't work, where should you put more emphasis where should we put less emphasis. I think that will help us have an advantage over many other companies that may not have the scale experts the -- basically the capital to put into what could be a very, very exciting future for us. We'll see how it plays out. And of course, nobody knows how regulations are going to play into this and that is something that could affect everybody. And David, I don't know if you want to talk about the market ROIs. \nDavid Goulden: Yeah. Sure. Thank you, I will. Lloyd thanks for the question. So first of all, let's clarify that this is not a change in our approach relative to our design to lean in this year to recovery in travel market. We're still leading in through a recovering travel market. And you can see from our top line numbers we're doing quite well. So that hasn't changed and marquee merchandising investment in total will still be higher this year than it was in 2019, it kind of goes hand-in-hand with that lead-in comment. What I would say and what you're seeing is within that envelope, as we look for ways to optimize our marketing spend we've done a little bit more optimization than we expected not going into all the components of where that's happening. But we're looking at channels for incrementality or return to direct things like that and consistently testing across a very large marketing spend. You see that during the quarter we spent about $1.8 billion on marketing. So it's a large amount of money that we're spending across that spectrum. We are always looking at ways to kind of optimize different spend, different channels and different approaches. So it's really more to do with our ongoing effort to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. But again, within the context we're still leaning in and looking to take share as the market continues to recover from COVID.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is open.\nMark Mahaney: Okay. Two questions please. First Glenn, have you noticed any changes in the type of travel demand? And I mean, short versus longer stay, rural suburban versus urban. And then, I wanted to ask the CFO question on AI, which is when you think about the impact that AI has had and Gen AI could have on the business from a financial perspective, do you think that that's -- Dave, do you think that's more likely to be on the monetization side or on the cost efficiency side? And I'm sure you're going to say both, but if you could be a little bit more -- if you have any more specifics on which of those you think could be more and could be more impacted by the application of Gen AI over time? Thanks a lot.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Mark, I'm smiling because I want to do number two first and to say both. But I'll do it in the order you gave it. So this is a question that comes up a lot because -- and I mentioned in the last call about how I'm always looking for the smoke signals is something changing. And some of the key things I always look at are people trading down in terms of star ratings, or are people going for a lower length of stay. Or are people shifting to areas that may be cheaper travel than what previously was more expensive travel, always looking for some sort of early warning signal that something is happening. And I do not see that yet. I do not see that in any of those areas. And that's what we're seeing right now. In terms of the AI, it's a very interesting question. And, of course, if we knew the answer we have a good sense of where should we be putting most of our investment dollars in our people put them into the area is going to give us the best return. But the things I mentioned in the first question, nobody knows the answer to these things. These are all just guesses. So at this stage it's very important to spread the bets around and see where the return is coming to see where we want to put people to work, put more money to work and see what's going to come back. One of the DNA of our company has always been experiment, see what works and keep pushing in what's better working better than other areas. So we're going to be doing a lot of different experimentation. And I think that's going to go on for some time before we really have a good sense where the best returns are. I think in the long run, of course, all -- both things you mentioned are going to give tremendous benefits to everybody. But if you're correct to ask the question, which things first and how much? And that is not known yet.\nMark Mahaney: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJustin Post: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, very strong in Asia, maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing there? And are you able to take some share from direct bookings at hotels or competitors? And then I thought your marketing ROI comment was very interesting in a very crowded quarter for marketing spend. So can you talk about -- is it the direct traffic that's helping you be more judicious with your marketing spend, or how are you getting that way up?\nGlenn Fogel: So I'll let David speak second about if you want to give any more color into the marketing question. I'll leave out Asia. So, yes, very pleased with Asia. Very nice to see the second quarter numbers and even nicer to see July accelerating like that. That's great. And, obviously, that's a function of Asia took more time to recover the restrictions dropped later. We're doing a year-over-year comp. So we're getting some benefit out of that. And by the way just everybody there is no confusion in China not producing significant they're far behind in terms of outbound recovery and we're much more an outbound player there and I don't expect a recovery in China for us for some time, significant time probably. So overall it's good. There are a lot of factors happening there. There are very similar to other parts of the world where people wanted to travel. They're going out there. They're doing it. And we have done a very good job, the same way we did in the US, and we did in Europe is making sure that when people wanted a trial we were there for them and we're seeing the results right there. And David if you want to give any more color into that marketing question?\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Justin, I think I gave a fair amount of color in my first answer, so I'm not going to repeat it. You did ask about when the direct makes place into this as well. And yes obviously as our direct mix is increasing as we commented it continues to do so. That helps but we're also getting helped from just looking across our total spend on marketing and looking at pockets of efficiency using some of the areas I talked about earlier.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks a lot. Could you give us an update on your efforts and progress in the North America vacation rental market just where you're at on that initiative? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi Kevin. So, I'm very pleased that we're continuing to advance while we talked about the overall -- we'll call it alternative accommodations is the way we define that area. We talk globally about our 11% growth being faster then the 9% for the overall company that 11% was a Booking.com number. But in terms of North America specifically are less reduced to the US which is the area where I think we all are more focused on. We have said many, many times I have seen many, many times that's an area of focus for us. We know we're under index. We know the areas we had to improve the product. And we talked in the last call, we called [indiscernible] for that too probably. About the things we're doing to improve it and that is both on the supply side making sure we're improving things so that people who own homes, people manage apartments, people who are in this space say, I'm sorry, but Booking.com, you're not doing certain things that you need to do for me. I'm glad that we are doing those things they will then be willing and are being to list their properties on our platform. That's great. And on the other side as I talked about last time is the importance okay, we got the properties now. We've got to make sure people know about it and I talked last time again about awareness and then we need to bring that up to. This is not a thing you saw overnight. This is something that you day by day, step-by-step grind it out and that's what we're doing in all different areas and we're seeing the progress. So, are we there? Yes? No, not even close to there yet. But the good thing is we're making the progress and that's all upside for us down the road. So we're going to keep on plugging away at it and I think we'll continue to experience good returns as we continue to invest in the area.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about where you're seeing the biggest impacts of connected trip? And how big of an impact do you think that's happening in terms of your outsized growth in the quarter? And then just switching to mobile the 48% of room nights booked through the apps. Anything you can share in terms of better frequency and loyalty among those app users?\nGlenn Fogel: So I'll leave the second one what David wants to actually reveal in that area of specifics. I'm not sure if he does or doesn't. Regarding the connected trip a couple of things on that. So let's start off right at the start that, the Connect trip is not producing material numbers increases in our -- what we're doing right now. The good numbers that we're showing right now are not because of a connected trip and it's just too small to show that. Imagine we're building it in orange -- until every piece is in place. You're not getting a lot of advantage from this arch. Right now build in the arch. So you see parts that are showing up but not the big effect. So for example really happy about one element which is you have to have a flight product. And we're doing 58% year-over-year growth in tickets and flights that's greater \u2013 I mean that's a really good number. It shows that we're producing a good flight product, we'll get that going. And then the other areas that we have to build out like things like the attractions, things like the right part gets to you from the hotel to the airport or from your home to the airport things like that. Building all those things out. And then of course, the glue payments. That's very important to make sure the whole thing is working correctly. We're able to give benefits value to both the traveler and enable our suppliers to have an opportunity to give types of benefits so they'll win that deal. These are things we need payments to do and we're making great progress and really happy to see that number up there they're 48% in the growth from last year. So all these elements are being worked on but that is not what's producing the very good returns in Q2. The flip side that says, look at all the potential future we have down the road. That's really encouraging to me. So I'm very happy where we are. I'm glad with the progress we're making but it should not be misthought that this is the thing that's produced Q2's numbers. And David I don't know if you want to talk about mobile app anything there in terms of repeat? \nDavid Goulden: Yes. Thank you. So Doug, you're going to ask the question? \nDoug Anmuth: No, go ahead. \nDavid Goulden: So in terms of when you think about what's happening with the app. There are three ways of people can interact with us directly. They can come through the app. They can come to us directly on a desktop device and come to a strictly on a mobile device. And out of those three not too surprisingly, the app is the \u2013 is the sickest channel in terms of frequency and loyalty as you mentioned, which is why obviously your app is now a very high percentage of direct and has become an increasing usage of direct and we think that's a good thing. But relative to differences in frequency and loyalty we're not in a position to get into those today but it is definitely our best channel in terms of frequency and loyalty.\nGlenn Fogel: And Doug, one other thing I want to add to this is Doug is the importance of the app and the connected trip. It's one of the important parts along with the other ones because one of the things that we really believe is important when you're traveling is to get advice, deals all sorts of things that you want to have your travel agent in your pocket. Well in your phone, that is the travel agent in the pocket. And then you throw on top of this all the Gen AI stuff all that. There's some real potential opportunities down the road that people are traveling they're going to have a much better experience than they have had in the past and that's what I'm looking for down the road.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you, Glenn and David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLee Horowitz: Great, thanks. Your direct booking mix improvement remain impressive. I guess for starters can you help us unpack what drove the acceleration in mix towards direct in the quarter? Something specific on your run that you guys are doing that drove that improvement quarter-on-quarter? And how should we take that being replicated going forward? And then secondly, are we getting to a point where direct mix may fully offset your growth into lower-margin business and thus over time allow you to actually walk margins back towards 2019 levels? Just any commentary there in terms of direct mix and margins over time would be helpful. Thanks so much.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Lee. I'll let David talk about whether or not he wants to talk about where the margins may go with that but I'll talk to just in general why do we continue quarter-after-quarter it seems to be improving our direct mix. And I believe the reason is because people like the product. That's the thing that helps. I've used it and they decide to come back because we're giving the best prices. We're going to most select selection, the greatest election. We're making it easier for them to do it. And we're providing great customer service something goes wrong to fix it. The reason I use and I'm not going to list some other new retail online retailers, there are some big ones I use. I use a need cash. I do it because it's better. And in the end, that's what wins as customers interest they come back with a better product, when the people believe in trust is the reason, people are loyal to a brand. That's what we're building here. And I believe, that's why we are slowly incrementally building out that direct mix. I think that's the biggest thing for me. David, you can add if you want to add anything to that? And also I'm not sure what you want to talk about in terms of margins, where people come direct and what that may do in the long run to our margin profile, EBITDA margin profile. \nDavid Goulden: Yes. Lee, we obviously go next is very helpful for the business. And of course, we're talking about here really direct mix within our accommodations business, is kind of core business. And we've mentioned before, that we believe that we can continue to improve margins, a little bit from where they were in 2023, but we're not trying to walk them all the way back to where they were in 2019. We all have significant businesses that are lower margin businesses than we had in 2019, when we have a large price business we're moving towards having a life payments business. So, direct mix can obviously, offset some of the pressure in the business. But don't expect it to walk our margins back to 2019. That's not what we've talked about gains, but we do believe it's one of the factors that can lead us to have continued improvement from where we are now.\nLee Horowitz: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. \nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe against your broader long-term goals for growth that you called out earlier in your comments. Would love to get any update about how you're feeling about supply growth, with respect to shared accommodations and/or local experiences against continuing to diversify supply, and build out more elements of the connected trip. And how do those factor in as elements of investment beyond 2023, looking out into next year? Thanks so much.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Eric. So the important thing is always priorities. What's the most important thing -- and we've mentioned numerous times, in terms of our alternative accommodations, how important it is to continue to build out the supply there. We have a large number of listings, that's true. I've talked about many times though, you have to have the right type of listing in the right locations. And we talked in the past, and it's not done yet in the US, getting the right accommodations, in the right places, so that we -- you will come they have something to buy. That's very important. That's top priority. When you ship down to something like attractions, not as important right now, it's important but it's not as high a priority, as getting an ultra combination. That's one of the most critical things, is making sure we're spending the time, energy, effort and money in the place they're giving us the best return. We have good attractions, from third-party connections. We have the key ones. And someday, it will be important to build out further along that. But for right now, for this year and next year, I want to make sure that we're going to have the bigger bang for the buck, which is being sure we have the right number and the right types of alternative accommodations on our platform.\nEric Sheridan: Super clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. \nJed Kelly: Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just going back to the US business. You highlighted mid-single-digit growth in the US. Can you talk about how that's trending relative to your competitors? And does that number does that capture the amount of Americans traveling over to Europe, or is that including in your European road lights? \nGlenn Fogel: Yeah. David, I'll let you go on both those. I mean I'm not sure what you want to talk about in terms of us versus competitors or not. \nDavid Goulden: Yes. Let me clarify. First of all, when we talk about these regions on a geography basis we're talking about on a book basis. So yes, Glenn it does capture bookings being made by U.S. travelers including those that are moving overseas, which is one of the reasons why we're getting growth. We mentioned that we're back to a mid-single-digit growth in July in the U.S. after seeing a very small decline in growth in Q2. And actually, that was really just April and May. By the time we got to June, we were back to growth as well. And then the April May comparisons relate you to the really strong rebound we saw particularly in those months when the old player was declared in Omicron last year. So we got a little bit of a funky comparison on there. So I think we're doing well in the marketplace. It's too early to kind of call how we see us doing any against the market for a single quarter. We like to kind of look at that on a longer-term basis you can look at how the year pans out. I would just point out that relative to the market, we mentioned in July when over 30% growth in the U.S. versus 2019 not significantly well ahead of any market data points. Market is perhaps closer to breakeven maybe slightly positive compared to 2019. We're up 30. So we tend to look at it over the longer period of time and we'll have a better view on exactly, how we're doing in the U.S. relative to the market as the year develops and as the year ends. As Glenn mentioned, we're pleased with many of our programs there. We also know there's a lot of upside for us to continue to push more into the U.S. marketplace. \nGlenn Fogel: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Brignall with Redburn. Your line is open.\nAlex Brignall: Hi, guys. Thank you. Glen must have taken a question. I just have one on the full year guidance. Obviously, the big change are the revenue divided by growth being up only 0.2% year-on-year. So could you just talk a little bit about how that will map next year? Obviously pulling forward some bookings brings forward the marketing and also therefore it has the impact on EBITDA. But can you talk about the longer-term dynamic presumably that has no impact on 2024 and on the margin trajectory you see going forward? \nDavid Goulden: Yes, Alex let me take that. So yes, I mean as you called out in the prepared remarks there are two factors that are causing us to take the guidance to take rates to call our number down a little bit from where we were before. And actually, both of kind of what I call good things happening within the business. So the first is that the business is growing faster and the booking window has steel on gate compared to where we thought we'd be this year which means that we're not going to get all the benefit from timing recovery this year. Some of that timing recovery will be delayed into next year. So that we should get back as a positive that piece of the reduction will get back as positive next year. The fact that flight is growing faster than we expect is also putting a little bit of pressure on margin. But as Glenn said, that's a good thing as well because we are building out more capabilities and more opportunities to work with our customers across connected transactions. So those are the two main dynamics, one of which we will get back in terms of the timing recovery, which we thought would happen this year will now happen more likely over two years. \nAlex Brignall: Okay. That's really helpful David. Thank you. As a follow-up, one of the things that's obviously changed is that some of your marketing dollars, which come below the revenue line have turned into merchandising dollars above the revenue line. And so it seems really like that revenue line is very, very hard to model. If we were to think of things in terms of EBITDA divided by gross bookings, is there any meaningful reason why your core business or the accommodation business outside of payments and flights and all of the sort of businesses that dilute that bigger should not see a return to pre-COVID profitability if not improvement if you increase direct mix. So if I just think accommodation EBITDA divided by gross bookings is there any reason why that should be less profitable in the future than it was before COVID.\nDavid Goulden: That's obviously a different way of looking at the EBITDA margins than we do but you're right obviously some of the contra revenue because of merchandising impacting the revenue line. The diet mix will obviously help overcome pressures in the accommodation business. Obviously, it seems like alternatives become slightly bigger seeing Asia becomes slightly bigger. So I think when we've talked about the long-term model for the business, assume that the core accommodations business can get back to in the rough region where it was 2019-ish and then the impact on EBITDA margins in the overall business will be driven by the mix of some of the newer businesses will become quite large in terms of particularly payments and flights neither which were a major factor in 2019. What I would point to is as I step back further and say what we've committed to for our long-term more, which I think is very important compared to 2019 is we have a business that is larger on the top line and the bottom line and growing faster the top line and the bottom line than it did in 2019. And that I think is the overall commitment that we've made that we're very convinced will stick to that I think will help drive your thinking about the overall model.\nAlex Brignall: So I guess it's crucial to think of the additional businesses as incremental to your core business.\nDavid Goulden: That's the last way to think about building the model out to look at our future EBITDA, yes. \nAlex Brignall: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. And really helpful to hear all the stats and see everything go as well this quarter. Glenn, I wanted to take you back maybe a year ago, we talked about growing bookings share of annual spend per customer. And as we see direct bookings increases to increase the connected trips rise, AI trip planners launch, just talk to us about the progress of just gaining share of that annual spend per customer. Any updated goals there? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: So Ron, let me try, understand the question. You're saying the annual spend per customer is that, right?\nRon Josey: So percentage share of travel spend. Yes. I think we talked about getting like 25% a year ago or something.\nGlenn Fogel: Yes right. So clearly part of the issue is that our customers, I'm happy about this, they don't always use us. Sometimes they use a competitor. And we see that. We see that unfortunately more than I'd like. Part of it is not having a product that they want. That's one thing, which we're building out as we talked a little bit about. And the other thing is post things that there's -- they go for example internationally will go for this brand and by domestic on that one. The key thing for us is to develop that loyalty that the reason that somebody really thinks that they will come to us for any travel will come to us. So part of it is bring all this together with the connected trip. Bring it all together with payment, developing the more we learn about the customer with their permission of course and then providing them with the -- what they may want more than anyone else. So they will always come back to us for all this. What do I believe in the end it could be to I believe that in the end we could have all customers all the time of course not. But I hope that we can continue to improve this substantially in the long run. And we'll see that as we get to finish off some of these areas though that we're still building out. Things like making sure we have enough of those alternative accommodations from people so he wants it we actually have one. It's like making sure that we have the payment product that they want to use a payment system that. Many things around the world we've talked about they don't use Visa card. They don't use Mastercard. They don't use [indiscernible] space. They got other ways they want to pay. Make sure we have that payment for them so that traveler customer to comfortable using us. And I can go on and on and on with many other things. That's what we need to do. And how high do I think can be? I'm not going to guess at it. I just know it could be substantially better than we are right now. \nRon Josey: Thank you, Glenn.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt with Wedbush. Your line is open. \nScott Devitt: Thanks for taking my questions. I had two please. The first one, I'm just wondering Glenn in terms of anything you can speak to in terms of shift in travel trends. There's been a lot of discussion around shoulder month travel April, May, August, September because of remote work and elevated prices. When I hear you guys talk about the months I don't necessarily see that in what you're saying but it may be related to comps. I'd just love to hear your perspective on shoulder month travel first? And then secondly now that there's a new loyalty program in the market I was just wondering your thoughts on Genius? And how you're thinking of the current offering relative to competing programs now in the market? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. So, yes, it used to be easy. There's a shoulder and there was a peak and life was easy to understand and that's how it used to be and it's not like that at all. And boy -- are things confusing right now when you have Omicron circling the world and some areas is hitting. And then a year later that's the area to comp against. So it gets very, very confusing. As David was pointing out in the numbers how something could look something, but actually it's much more understandable they had COVID in that area last year or they just opened up last year. Here's the thing. I hope that next year things have turned back to a more normalized ease understanding what the seasonality of travel is. However, there's a new thing this come in and that is the idea of people not going to offices as much and then, they're also traveling more. So they're using this Monday and Friday where they're traveling more for these longer weekends et cetera or perhaps a whole week et cetera. And I think that's going to make a more uncertainty to see what that is. What that may end up doing is, evening out travel throughout the year more where people are able to use time in areas that used to be shoulder season, but now people are using more which help spread out the travel more. I don't know. But we'll find out. That's why the -- I can't change any of that. So I'm not going to worry about it too much. What we use is in the near-term is, what signals we see in terms of how much we should spend on marketing or not. And in the long run what we hope is to continue to improve the products, because that's the way in the long run to win. That's how we do it. I'm sure lots of you are going to have lots of guesses about what the seasonality trends are going to be for the next couple of years globally. I'm not going to try and do that. You had another question I believe I forgot it though.\nScott Devitt: Yeah. Just Genius and your thoughts on Genius for the computing product now in the market?\nGlenn Fogel: So there\u2026\nScott Devitt: There is \u2026\nGlenn Fogel: Yeah. So if we look to way back to when American Airlines came out with our first loyalty plan. I'm actually old enough to me, I actually joined it. All the way to now there are lots of different loyalty plans for all different things and beyond travel for sure. And that another company comes out with a new one whatever that's nice interesting but the truth is I love what we're doing on Genius. I think it's a great pod and we're going to do even more with it. One of the things that's really wonderful about is that we use it with our partners together in a way to give benefit to both of us making sure that it is actually incrementally improving what's good for that partner along with of course being so good for our customer traveler, doing that is the way of any type of loyalty program should really work. And that's something that I think we've done a good job within [indiscernible]. Now we need to gain on more benefits and any more benefit that enable the supplier to give more opportunity to merchandise and give things that will be good for the traveler so they can win that actual transaction. And that's something we're going to continue to do. We've talked about how we've improved it from where it just started out and now we're up to three tiers. And there are lots of things down the road that will add on as we continue to develop the connected trip that will give us opportunity to give more benefit -- incremental benefits to both sides. I really don't worry too much about what somebody else is doing a more concern making sure we're executing right on the things that's important for our customers, or both the travelers and the suppliers.\nScott Devitt: Yeah. Thank you and congratulations.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Glenn Fogel, for closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel: Well, I'd like to thank everybody for participating. We are very, very pleased with the results you had. So I want to thank the partners, of course our customers, our dedicated employees and of course our shareholders. We appreciate everybody's support, as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you very much, and good night.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect. Goodbye.",

            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the second quarter as well as our thoughts for Q3 and for the full year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019, where we think these are helpful. Information, regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website, after the conclusion of the earnings call. Now on to our second quarter results, again it's a tough year-over-year comparison in the second quarter, due to a strong rebound in travel after Omicron in Q2 last year. We were pleased to have blurred 9% room night growth in Q2 which was a few percentage points better than our expectations. Looking at our year-over-year room night growth by region in the second quarter, Asia was up over 40%. Rest of world was up low-double digits. Europe was up a couple of points and the US was down slightly. It's helpful to remember that the US was very strong last Q2 and stronger than Q1 and Q3 versus 2019 due to a rebound from Omicron. Compared to 2019, our Q2 global room night growth was 26% which was in line with Q1. For the second quarter, all our major regions grew at a similar rate versus 2019. In Q2, the booking window of Booking.com expanded further versus 2019 than it did in Q1. The Q2 booking window of Booking.com also expanded versus 2022. As Glenn mentioned, our mobile apps represented about 48% of our total room nights in the quarter, which was about six percentage points higher than the second quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increased mix of our room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2022. For the first time since the onset of the pandemic, in Q2, we saw the international mix of our room nights fully recover to 2019 levels. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter were higher than Q2 2022 as the second quarter of 2022, benefited from the strong recovery in new bookings following the relaxation of travel restrictions in many parts of the world post-Omicron. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter continue to be below 2019 levels. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q2 room night growth was about 11% year-over-year and the global mix of our tag recombination room it was about 34% which was higher than about 32% in Q2 2022 versus 2019, alternative combination room night growth was about 38%. Q2 gross bookings increased 15% year-over-year, or 16% on a constant currency basis. The 15% increase in gross bookings was six points higher than the 9% room night increase due to 5% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple points from flight bookings, partially offset by the one percentage point of negative impact from FX movements. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia and a lower mix of room nights from the US. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about nine percentage points year-over-year. Despite the higher ADRs in the second quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star-rating levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up about 58% year-over-year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's Flight offering. Revenue for the second quarter came in nicely ahead of our expectations, increasing 27% year-over-year, or about 28% on a constant currency basis. Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points above last year, which was about in line with our expectations. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 4% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 50 basis points lower than Q2 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 was about 60 basis points lower than last year, which was better than our expectation. Relative to our expectation, this was primarily due to better ROIs in our paid channels, as well as lower than expected merchandising spend, which was impacted by the booking window being more expanded than we expected in the quarter which will push merchandising expense into future periods at the time revenue is recognized. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 30 basis points compared with last year, a bit better than our expectation. About 48% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q2, up from about 38% in Q2 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 20% year-over-year, which was below our expectation due to lower IT expenses in the quarter, including some impact from phasing of IT spend into later in the year. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion in the second quarter, which was up 64% year-over-year, and would have been up 70% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was well above our expectation due to the stronger topline, the efficiencies in marketing and merchandising, and lower than expected IT expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA margins increased by about 7 percentage points versus Q2 2022. Non-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion in the second quarter resulted in non-GAAP EPS of $37.62 per share, which was up 97% year-over-year. Our average share count in the second quarter was 9% below Q2 2022 and 15% below Q2 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $1.3 billion in the quarter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $15.7 million was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $15.3 billion due to the $1.9 billion of debt issuances in May 2023 and the $1.6 billion of free cash flow generated in the second quarter offset by the $3.1 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter. In the first half of the year, we repurchased $5.1 billion of our shares, which represented 5% and of our year end 2022 share count. The repurchases so far this year take our combined authorization down to $19 billion from the $24 billion we discussed earlier in the year. We remain comfortable with our ability to complete the full $24 billion of share repurchases within four years from when we started the program at the beginning of this year assuming no major downturn in the travel environment. Now on to our thoughts for the third quarter of 2023. In July, we saw year-over-year room night growth of about 20% up from 9% in Q2. Looking across our major regions, in July we saw Asia up about 45%; rest of World up over 20%; Europe up mid-teens; and the US up mid single-digits. When comparing versus 2019 July room night growth was in a similar range to the 26% growth in Q2. The US was our most recovered region with growth at over 30% versus 2019. Our comments for the third quarter made the assumption that room night growth will be up low double digits year-on-year assuming some moderation in growth from July due in part to harder prior year comparables in August and September. You'll recall from our commentary on the third quarter of 2022 that room night growth versus 2019 was 4% in July 2022 and 10% in August and September 2022. In addition, we expect that due to expanded booking window in the first half of the year stayed in Q3, but there will be fewer last-minute bookings for stays in the rest of Q3. We expect Q3 gross bookings to grow about seven points faster the room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and a few points of positive impact from FX movements. We expect accommodation constant currency ADRs to be about in line with Q3 2022 including a couple of points of pressure from the changes in regional mix. We expect Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be around 19% slightly above last year due to a more positive impact from timing in part due to the expanded booking window in the first half of this year and from increased revenue from payments. We expect these will be partially offset by a higher mix of flights and increased merchandising spend some of which is related to bookings we received earlier in the year. We expect Q3 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 to be slightly lower than last year. We expect Q3 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 20 basis points higher last year primarily due to higher gross bookings mix. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q3 to grow year-over-year about 30% due to higher personnel and related expenses, higher IT expenses including the impact of phasing from Q2, and higher indirect taxes in G&A. The year-over-year growth in our more fixed expenses includes about seven percentage points from changes in FX. The difference between the 20% growth in our more fixed expenses in Q2 and a 30% growth in Q3 is driven mainly by FX and major one. Taking all into account, we expect adjusted -- we expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be around 20% higher than last year. Given the strong level of bookings that we've seen, we are updating our commentary for the full year. We currently expect gross bookings to grow slightly over 20%, up from our previous expectation for low teens growth. We expect full year room night growth in the mid-teens and constant currency combination ADRs were up slightly for the year, including a couple of points of pressure from changes in regional mix. We currently expect revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to increase year-over-year by about 20 basis points down from our previous expectation of 50 basis points increase. The reduction in our full year take rate is driven by less of a benefit from timing including due to the higher growth rate we expected earlier in this year and also due to expanded booking window. Also, from stronger performance, which drove a higher mix of flights than expected earlier in the year. We currently expect marketing merchandising, as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly below in 2022 as compared to our previous expectation for it to be similar to 2022. The improvements in our expectation is driven primarily by higher ROIs in off paid channels. We currently expect our more fixed expenses to grow about 25% up from our previous expectation to around 20%. The increase in our expectation is driven primarily by variable components of personnel expense due to the overperformance versus expectations at the start of the year as well as higher indirect taxes which are generally tied to revenues and some additional FX pressure. We manage our more fixed expenses very carefully and continue to expect our more fixed expenses next year to grow at an appreciably lower rate than this year. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we are pleased with our year-to-date results and the momentum in the business that we moved into Q3. We'll now move to Q&A. Adam, can you please open the lines? Yeah. Sure. Thank you, I will. Lloyd thanks for the question. So first of all, let's clarify that this is not a change in our approach relative to our design to lean in this year to recovery in travel market. We're still leading in through a recovering travel market. And you can see from our top line numbers we're doing quite well. So that hasn't changed and marquee merchandising investment in total will still be higher this year than it was in 2019, it kind of goes hand-in-hand with that lead-in comment. What I would say and what you're seeing is within that envelope, as we look for ways to optimize our marketing spend we've done a little bit more optimization than we expected not going into all the components of where that's happening. But we're looking at channels for incrementality or return to direct things like that and consistently testing across a very large marketing spend. You see that during the quarter we spent about $1.8 billion on marketing. So it's a large amount of money that we're spending across that spectrum. We are always looking at ways to kind of optimize different spend, different channels and different approaches. So it's really more to do with our ongoing effort to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. But again, within the context we're still leaning in and looking to take share as the market continues to recover from COVID. Yes. Justin, I think I gave a fair amount of color in my first answer, so I'm not going to repeat it. You did ask about when the direct makes place into this as well. And yes obviously as our direct mix is increasing as we commented it continues to do so. That helps but we're also getting helped from just looking across our total spend on marketing and looking at pockets of efficiency using some of the areas I talked about earlier. Yes. Thank you. So Doug, you're going to ask the question? So in terms of when you think about what's happening with the app. There are three ways of people can interact with us directly. They can come through the app. They can come to us directly on a desktop device and come to a strictly on a mobile device. And out of those three not too surprisingly, the app is the \u2013 is the sickest channel in terms of frequency and loyalty as you mentioned, which is why obviously your app is now a very high percentage of direct and has become an increasing usage of direct and we think that's a good thing. But relative to differences in frequency and loyalty we're not in a position to get into those today but it is definitely our best channel in terms of frequency and loyalty. Yes. Lee, we obviously go next is very helpful for the business. And of course, we're talking about here really direct mix within our accommodations business, is kind of core business. And we've mentioned before, that we believe that we can continue to improve margins, a little bit from where they were in 2023, but we're not trying to walk them all the way back to where they were in 2019. We all have significant businesses that are lower margin businesses than we had in 2019, when we have a large price business we're moving towards having a life payments business. So, direct mix can obviously, offset some of the pressure in the business. But don't expect it to walk our margins back to 2019. That's not what we've talked about gains, but we do believe it's one of the factors that can lead us to have continued improvement from where we are now. Yes. Let me clarify. First of all, when we talk about these regions on a geography basis we're talking about on a book basis. So yes, Glenn it does capture bookings being made by U.S. travelers including those that are moving overseas, which is one of the reasons why we're getting growth. We mentioned that we're back to a mid-single-digit growth in July in the U.S. after seeing a very small decline in growth in Q2. And actually, that was really just April and May. By the time we got to June, we were back to growth as well. And then the April May comparisons relate you to the really strong rebound we saw particularly in those months when the old player was declared in Omicron last year. So we got a little bit of a funky comparison on there. So I think we're doing well in the marketplace. It's too early to kind of call how we see us doing any against the market for a single quarter. We like to kind of look at that on a longer-term basis you can look at how the year pans out. I would just point out that relative to the market, we mentioned in July when over 30% growth in the U.S. versus 2019 not significantly well ahead of any market data points. Market is perhaps closer to breakeven maybe slightly positive compared to 2019. We're up 30. So we tend to look at it over the longer period of time and we'll have a better view on exactly, how we're doing in the U.S. relative to the market as the year develops and as the year ends. As Glenn mentioned, we're pleased with many of our programs there. We also know there's a lot of upside for us to continue to push more into the U.S. marketplace. Yes, Alex let me take that. So yes, I mean as you called out in the prepared remarks there are two factors that are causing us to take the guidance to take rates to call our number down a little bit from where we were before. And actually, both of kind of what I call good things happening within the business. So the first is that the business is growing faster and the booking window has steel on gate compared to where we thought we'd be this year which means that we're not going to get all the benefit from timing recovery this year. Some of that timing recovery will be delayed into next year. So that we should get back as a positive that piece of the reduction will get back as positive next year. The fact that flight is growing faster than we expect is also putting a little bit of pressure on margin. But as Glenn said, that's a good thing as well because we are building out more capabilities and more opportunities to work with our customers across connected transactions. So those are the two main dynamics, one of which we will get back in terms of the timing recovery, which we thought would happen this year will now happen more likely over two years. That's obviously a different way of looking at the EBITDA margins than we do but you're right obviously some of the contra revenue because of merchandising impacting the revenue line. The diet mix will obviously help overcome pressures in the accommodation business. Obviously, it seems like alternatives become slightly bigger seeing Asia becomes slightly bigger. So I think when we've talked about the long-term model for the business, assume that the core accommodations business can get back to in the rough region where it was 2019-ish and then the impact on EBITDA margins in the overall business will be driven by the mix of some of the newer businesses will become quite large in terms of particularly payments and flights neither which were a major factor in 2019. What I would point to is as I step back further and say what we've committed to for our long-term more, which I think is very important compared to 2019 is we have a business that is larger on the top line and the bottom line and growing faster the top line and the bottom line than it did in 2019. And that I think is the overall commitment that we've made that we're very convinced will stick to that I think will help drive your thinking about the overall model. That's the last way to think about building the model out to look at our future EBITDA, yes."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report that in the second quarter we continue to see robust leisure travel demand which helped drive the strong results we are announcing today. The 268 million room nights booked in the second quarter increased by 9% year-over-year and gross bookings of $39.7 billion grew 15% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly gross bookings ever. Both room nights and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the favorable demand environment. Revenue growth of 27% in Q2 also nicely outperformed our expectations. The strong top line results in the quarter combined with better-than-expected marketing efficiency helped drive our Q2 adjusted EBITDA to about $1.8 billion which is an increase of 64% versus Q2 last year, and meaningfully exceeded our prior growth expectations of about 35%. Looking at the month of July we have seen an acceleration in year-over-year room night growth relative to the 9% growth we reported for Q2. We estimate July room nights increased by about 20% year-over-year benefiting from the easier comparison to July 2022. Overall, we have been very pleased to see our strong performance in the first half of the year which has benefited from the continued strength and resiliency of overall travel demand. Our solid start to the year combined with what we currently believe will be a new all-time high for Q3 summer travel period results and an improved outlook for the full year which David will discuss in detail in his comments. While the near-term results and outlook are encouraging we remain focused on what is important for the business for the long term which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our enterprise while simultaneously remaining cost conscious. We are seeing progress and momentum across several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long term. These initiatives include advancing our Connected Trip vision, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, continuing to grow alternative accommodations, and building more direct relationships with our travel bookers. Starting with the Connected Trip: this is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. To be clear, this is not a discrete product we will introduce at some point in the future, instead this is a meaningfully enhanced way for a booker to experience and utilize Booking.com. Over time you will see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform that move us another step closer to this long-term vision, and importantly, this approach allows us to realize benefits while we are building towards that future state. We believe that the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented, and frustrating to travelers than it should be and, eventually, our Connected Trip vision will greatly improve it via technology. Looking at the other side of the travel marketplace, we believe that our supplier partners will also benefit greatly from the Connected Trip as it will provide more opportunities to personalize and merchandise their offerings. We continue to build out our Connected Trip vision and have much more work to do, but we are pleased with the progress we have seen so far and expect it to ultimately result in increased customer and supplier engagement with our platform.  We have always envisioned the Connected Trip as having AI technology at its center. Across our company, we have a long history with investing in AI technology and incorporating it into our platforms in order to optimize interactions with both our travelers and partners. This is an area where we believe we are well positioned given we have built strong teams of AI experts and gained valuable experience from using AI extensively for years. In addition to the many current applications for AI on our platforms, we believe that we can build an even more compelling and differentiated offering for our bookers if we can leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience: A Connected Trip that would be more responsive to a booker's needs and help manage different aspects of their trips. Generative AI may play an important role in delivering that Connected Trip experience to our bookers, and our teams have been hard at work to integrate this exciting technology into our offerings in innovative ways, for example, In early July, Priceline unveiled its 2023 Summer Release, which delivered over 40 new booking tools and upgrades, including Penny. Penny is Priceline's generative AI travel assistant. Priceline has currently positioned Penny at the \u201cend-of-the-funnel\u201d on the checkout page where Penny can answer travel related questions that a customer may have when they have reached the checkout page. Penny is built on Priceline's own proprietary technology and data, and also leverages large language model technology to power its conversational capabilities. The combination of these technologies allows for innovations like the ability to make a booking directly in the chat interface. The Priceline team is rapidly gaining insights on booker questions, concerns, and behavior as Penny continues to interact with customers. The plan is to further enhance Penny over time by leveraging those valuable learnings. Around the same time as Priceline's Summer Release, Booking.com launched its own AI Trip Planner, which began rolling out on the mobile app in the US to Genius customers. In contrast to Penny the AI trip planner sits towards the top of the funnel, where travelers are in the discovery and planning processes for their trips. Built upon the foundation of Booking.com's existing machine learning models that recommend accommodation options to millions of travelers on the platform every day the AI trip planner is also partially powered by large language mall technology to create a conversational experience for people to start their planning processes. The AI trip planner advances planning by providing travelers with a rich visual list of destinations and properties including Booking.com's live pricing information with deep links to view more details on the options. From the chat interface of the AI trip planner bookers can tap on any recommended accommodation they're interested in and then complete the reservation. Accretive to our approach here is to marry our own proprietary data and machine learning models with degenerative AI technology. This allows us to provide a conversational interface with the traveler while leveraging our own recommendation engine to provide accurate detail and real-time information on the property recommendations. Like Priceline, the Booking.com team is already gaining valuable insights from the interactions with bookers even though the trip planner is in beta and is still currently in a relatively limited rollout. While we are excited by these new advances at Booking.com and Priceline it is of course still very early days and we have much more to learn about how customers will ultimately want to interact with this new technology. In addition, we mentioned last quarter that [indiscernible] like Kayak were Experian [ph] with AI plug-ins. And we will continue to examine all areas of our company to ensure we are taking advantage of AI-created efficiencies. We are confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI development and improve our products for our customers given our many years' experience in AI our travel-related data and connections to our supply partners and our human and financial capital. Across our businesses, we have two equally important customers our travelers and our supply partners with each representing one side of our marketplace. For our supply partners, we strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform and we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental demand in developing products and features to help support their businesses. One area of focus for us on the supply side continues to be our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com. Alternative accommodation room nights grew faster than our traditional hotel category at about 11% year-over-year for the second quarter and represented about 34% of Booking.com's total room nights, which is two percentage points higher than in Q2 2022. This is a new all-time high mix of our total room nights. We are pleased to see continued momentum in terms of alternative accommodation of supply growth both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about $7 million by the end of the second quarter which is about 8% higher than Q2 last year. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product for our supply partners and travelers particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. In the second quarter, our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continue to increase year-over-year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and we believe will result in increased traveler loyalty. About 48% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the second quarter which is about six percentage points higher than in Q2 2022 an acceleration in the mix shift compared to Q1 and all-time high in terms of mix of bookings coming from our mobile apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strength of travel demand so far this year and signs of what we expect to be a record summer travel season. Our teams continue to innovate and execute well against our key strategic priorities which helps us position our business well for the long-term. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. Lloyd, why don't I take the first one about AI and then I'll let David talk about marketing and ROIs. So first and while it's an easy answer, it's the true answer, which is nobody knows yet how there's a very new technology generative AI how that's going to play out in the long run. That's one. Two, even though we don't know how it's going to come out, we know it's very important that we continue to do everything we can to explore experiment see what might be very helpful to our travelers and to our supply partners too along with internally to do things better internally for us. Every company is doing that including the big search engines like Google and they're coming out what they can do and nobody knows. A couple of things though I am fairly certain that history provides a good road map. And that is there will be changes but companies that are able to adapt quickly be agile have great technology experts will benefit from these kinds of changes. We saw it as things for example like when the mobile for came out, we were able to adapt quickly adjust and we got I think a very good advantage from that. I think that we will hopefully get the same type of benefits as this new technology Generate AI comes out. But one thing I didn't mention in the prepared remarks was, I mentioned all the companies, but I didn't mention Agoda. So Agoda is doing some very good things in terms of internally how can we use Gen AI to become more efficient with all types of code co-pilot type systems. So there are lots of different things that we're playing with all one. I'm really happy the way that we're doing from different directions having price line doing it at the bottom of the phone see how that works. Doing Booking.com's AI Trip Planner tops how that's doing that. The ChatGPT plug-ins from open table and from Kaya. So being able to do all these things from the different brands and being able to learn from each other, what works, what doesn't work, where should you put more emphasis where should we put less emphasis. I think that will help us have an advantage over many other companies that may not have the scale experts the -- basically the capital to put into what could be a very, very exciting future for us. We'll see how it plays out. And of course, nobody knows how regulations are going to play into this and that is something that could affect everybody. And David, I don't know if you want to talk about the market ROIs. Hi, Mark, I'm smiling because I want to do number two first and to say both. But I'll do it in the order you gave it. So this is a question that comes up a lot because -- and I mentioned in the last call about how I'm always looking for the smoke signals is something changing. And some of the key things I always look at are people trading down in terms of star ratings, or are people going for a lower length of stay. Or are people shifting to areas that may be cheaper travel than what previously was more expensive travel, always looking for some sort of early warning signal that something is happening. And I do not see that yet. I do not see that in any of those areas. And that's what we're seeing right now. In terms of the AI, it's a very interesting question. And, of course, if we knew the answer we have a good sense of where should we be putting most of our investment dollars in our people put them into the area is going to give us the best return. But the things I mentioned in the first question, nobody knows the answer to these things. These are all just guesses. So at this stage it's very important to spread the bets around and see where the return is coming to see where we want to put people to work, put more money to work and see what's going to come back. One of the DNA of our company has always been experiment, see what works and keep pushing in what's better working better than other areas. So we're going to be doing a lot of different experimentation. And I think that's going to go on for some time before we really have a good sense where the best returns are. I think in the long run, of course, all -- both things you mentioned are going to give tremendous benefits to everybody. But if you're correct to ask the question, which things first and how much? And that is not known yet. So I'll let David speak second about if you want to give any more color into the marketing question. I'll leave out Asia. So, yes, very pleased with Asia. Very nice to see the second quarter numbers and even nicer to see July accelerating like that. That's great. And, obviously, that's a function of Asia took more time to recover the restrictions dropped later. We're doing a year-over-year comp. So we're getting some benefit out of that. And by the way just everybody there is no confusion in China not producing significant they're far behind in terms of outbound recovery and we're much more an outbound player there and I don't expect a recovery in China for us for some time, significant time probably. So overall it's good. There are a lot of factors happening there. There are very similar to other parts of the world where people wanted to travel. They're going out there. They're doing it. And we have done a very good job, the same way we did in the US, and we did in Europe is making sure that when people wanted a trial we were there for them and we're seeing the results right there. And David if you want to give any more color into that marketing question? Hi Kevin. So, I'm very pleased that we're continuing to advance while we talked about the overall -- we'll call it alternative accommodations is the way we define that area. We talk globally about our 11% growth being faster then the 9% for the overall company that 11% was a Booking.com number. But in terms of North America specifically are less reduced to the US which is the area where I think we all are more focused on. We have said many, many times I have seen many, many times that's an area of focus for us. We know we're under index. We know the areas we had to improve the product. And we talked in the last call, we called [indiscernible] for that too probably. About the things we're doing to improve it and that is both on the supply side making sure we're improving things so that people who own homes, people manage apartments, people who are in this space say, I'm sorry, but Booking.com, you're not doing certain things that you need to do for me. I'm glad that we are doing those things they will then be willing and are being to list their properties on our platform. That's great. And on the other side as I talked about last time is the importance okay, we got the properties now. We've got to make sure people know about it and I talked last time again about awareness and then we need to bring that up to. This is not a thing you saw overnight. This is something that you day by day, step-by-step grind it out and that's what we're doing in all different areas and we're seeing the progress. So, are we there? Yes? No, not even close to there yet. But the good thing is we're making the progress and that's all upside for us down the road. So we're going to keep on plugging away at it and I think we'll continue to experience good returns as we continue to invest in the area. So I'll leave the second one what David wants to actually reveal in that area of specifics. I'm not sure if he does or doesn't. Regarding the connected trip a couple of things on that. So let's start off right at the start that, the Connect trip is not producing material numbers increases in our -- what we're doing right now. The good numbers that we're showing right now are not because of a connected trip and it's just too small to show that. Imagine we're building it in orange -- until every piece is in place. You're not getting a lot of advantage from this arch. Right now build in the arch. So you see parts that are showing up but not the big effect. So for example really happy about one element which is you have to have a flight product. And we're doing 58% year-over-year growth in tickets and flights that's greater \u2013 I mean that's a really good number. It shows that we're producing a good flight product, we'll get that going. And then the other areas that we have to build out like things like the attractions, things like the right part gets to you from the hotel to the airport or from your home to the airport things like that. Building all those things out. And then of course, the glue payments. That's very important to make sure the whole thing is working correctly. We're able to give benefits value to both the traveler and enable our suppliers to have an opportunity to give types of benefits so they'll win that deal. These are things we need payments to do and we're making great progress and really happy to see that number up there they're 48% in the growth from last year. So all these elements are being worked on but that is not what's producing the very good returns in Q2. The flip side that says, look at all the potential future we have down the road. That's really encouraging to me. So I'm very happy where we are. I'm glad with the progress we're making but it should not be misthought that this is the thing that's produced Q2's numbers. And David I don't know if you want to talk about mobile app anything there in terms of repeat? And Doug, one other thing I want to add to this is Doug is the importance of the app and the connected trip. It's one of the important parts along with the other ones because one of the things that we really believe is important when you're traveling is to get advice, deals all sorts of things that you want to have your travel agent in your pocket. Well in your phone, that is the travel agent in the pocket. And then you throw on top of this all the Gen AI stuff all that. There's some real potential opportunities down the road that people are traveling they're going to have a much better experience than they have had in the past and that's what I'm looking for down the road. Hi, Lee. I'll let David talk about whether or not he wants to talk about where the margins may go with that but I'll talk to just in general why do we continue quarter-after-quarter it seems to be improving our direct mix. And I believe the reason is because people like the product. That's the thing that helps. I've used it and they decide to come back because we're giving the best prices. We're going to most select selection, the greatest election. We're making it easier for them to do it. And we're providing great customer service something goes wrong to fix it. The reason I use and I'm not going to list some other new retail online retailers, there are some big ones I use. I use a need cash. I do it because it's better. And in the end, that's what wins as customers interest they come back with a better product, when the people believe in trust is the reason, people are loyal to a brand. That's what we're building here. And I believe, that's why we are slowly incrementally building out that direct mix. I think that's the biggest thing for me. David, you can add if you want to add anything to that? And also I'm not sure what you want to talk about in terms of margins, where people come direct and what that may do in the long run to our margin profile, EBITDA margin profile. Hi, Eric. So the important thing is always priorities. What's the most important thing -- and we've mentioned numerous times, in terms of our alternative accommodations, how important it is to continue to build out the supply there. We have a large number of listings, that's true. I've talked about many times though, you have to have the right type of listing in the right locations. And we talked in the past, and it's not done yet in the US, getting the right accommodations, in the right places, so that we -- you will come they have something to buy. That's very important. That's top priority. When you ship down to something like attractions, not as important right now, it's important but it's not as high a priority, as getting an ultra combination. That's one of the most critical things, is making sure we're spending the time, energy, effort and money in the place they're giving us the best return. We have good attractions, from third-party connections. We have the key ones. And someday, it will be important to build out further along that. But for right now, for this year and next year, I want to make sure that we're going to have the bigger bang for the buck, which is being sure we have the right number and the right types of alternative accommodations on our platform. Yeah. David, I'll let you go on both those. I mean I'm not sure what you want to talk about in terms of us versus competitors or not. Thank you. So Ron, let me try, understand the question. You're saying the annual spend per customer is that, right? Yes right. So clearly part of the issue is that our customers, I'm happy about this, they don't always use us. Sometimes they use a competitor. And we see that. We see that unfortunately more than I'd like. Part of it is not having a product that they want. That's one thing, which we're building out as we talked a little bit about. And the other thing is post things that there's -- they go for example internationally will go for this brand and by domestic on that one. The key thing for us is to develop that loyalty that the reason that somebody really thinks that they will come to us for any travel will come to us. So part of it is bring all this together with the connected trip. Bring it all together with payment, developing the more we learn about the customer with their permission of course and then providing them with the -- what they may want more than anyone else. So they will always come back to us for all this. What do I believe in the end it could be to I believe that in the end we could have all customers all the time of course not. But I hope that we can continue to improve this substantially in the long run. And we'll see that as we get to finish off some of these areas though that we're still building out. Things like making sure we have enough of those alternative accommodations from people so he wants it we actually have one. It's like making sure that we have the payment product that they want to use a payment system that. Many things around the world we've talked about they don't use Visa card. They don't use Mastercard. They don't use [indiscernible] space. They got other ways they want to pay. Make sure we have that payment for them so that traveler customer to comfortable using us. And I can go on and on and on with many other things. That's what we need to do. And how high do I think can be? I'm not going to guess at it. I just know it could be substantially better than we are right now. Sure. So, yes, it used to be easy. There's a shoulder and there was a peak and life was easy to understand and that's how it used to be and it's not like that at all. And boy -- are things confusing right now when you have Omicron circling the world and some areas is hitting. And then a year later that's the area to comp against. So it gets very, very confusing. As David was pointing out in the numbers how something could look something, but actually it's much more understandable they had COVID in that area last year or they just opened up last year. Here's the thing. I hope that next year things have turned back to a more normalized ease understanding what the seasonality of travel is. However, there's a new thing this come in and that is the idea of people not going to offices as much and then, they're also traveling more. So they're using this Monday and Friday where they're traveling more for these longer weekends et cetera or perhaps a whole week et cetera. And I think that's going to make a more uncertainty to see what that is. What that may end up doing is, evening out travel throughout the year more where people are able to use time in areas that used to be shoulder season, but now people are using more which help spread out the travel more. I don't know. But we'll find out. That's why the -- I can't change any of that. So I'm not going to worry about it too much. What we use is in the near-term is, what signals we see in terms of how much we should spend on marketing or not. And in the long run what we hope is to continue to improve the products, because that's the way in the long run to win. That's how we do it. I'm sure lots of you are going to have lots of guesses about what the seasonality trends are going to be for the next couple of years globally. I'm not going to try and do that. You had another question I believe I forgot it though. So there... Yeah. So if we look to way back to when American Airlines came out with our first loyalty plan. I'm actually old enough to me, I actually joined it. All the way to now there are lots of different loyalty plans for all different things and beyond travel for sure. And that another company comes out with a new one whatever that's nice interesting but the truth is I love what we're doing on Genius. I think it's a great pod and we're going to do even more with it. One of the things that's really wonderful about is that we use it with our partners together in a way to give benefit to both of us making sure that it is actually incrementally improving what's good for that partner along with of course being so good for our customer traveler, doing that is the way of any type of loyalty program should really work. And that's something that I think we've done a good job within [indiscernible]. Now we need to gain on more benefits and any more benefit that enable the supplier to give more opportunity to merchandise and give things that will be good for the traveler so they can win that actual transaction. And that's something we're going to continue to do. We've talked about how we've improved it from where it just started out and now we're up to three tiers. And there are lots of things down the road that will add on as we continue to develop the connected trip that will give us opportunity to give more benefit -- incremental benefits to both sides. I really don't worry too much about what somebody else is doing a more concern making sure we're executing right on the things that's important for our customers, or both the travelers and the suppliers. Thank you. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for participating. We are very, very pleased with the results you had. So I want to thank the partners, of course our customers, our dedicated employees and of course our shareholders. We appreciate everybody's support, as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you very much, and good night."

And now, I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report that in the first quarter, we reached all-time quarterly highs for both room nights of $274 million and gross bookings of $39.4 billion and achieved year-over-year growth rates of 38% and 44%, respectively. On a constant currency basis, first quarter gross bookings growth was even stronger at 52% year-over-year. Both room night and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the continued strength in leisure travel demand and from a lengthening booking window, particularly in Europe and the U.S. The room night and gross bookings outperformance versus our expectations was driven by bookings that will stay in future periods which is when the revenue will be recognized. As a result of this timing difference, revenue was approximately in line with our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was a bit below given the additional marketing expenses associated with the future states. When we look at room night growth versus 2019, we have seen a slight increase in April compared with what we saw in the first quarter. Though on a year-over-year basis, growth has decelerated since April last year saw an accelerating travel recovery, making the comparison more difficult. Overall, we remain encouraged by the continued strength and resiliency of travel demand so far this year which speaks to consumers' strong desires to travel. We currently see very strong growth of bookings received for travel during our peak summer period in quarter 3. Though we note, these bookings represent a modest percentage of what will likely be booked for total summer travel and most of these bookings are cancelable. While travel booking trends have remained robust, we recognize that there is uncertainty regarding the path of the global economy. However, we believe we are well positioned to navigate any potential near-term economic uncertainty given our highly variable expense structure, solid operating results, substantial liquidity and strong free cash flow. This allows us to remain focused on what's important for the long term which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our business while remaining cost conscious and implementing initiatives across the business to drive cost efficiency. We continue to make progress on our key strategic priorities, including our long-term Connected Trip vision. The Connected Trip is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveller customers and supplier partners. Our payments platform at Booking.com ties into our Connected Trip vision as payments helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience for our travelers. Those still small today, we are seeing an increase in the mix of transactions that are connected to another book travel component in a trip. We believe continuing to build on this progress will improve the booking experience for more of our customers which we believe will help drive increasing customer engagement with our platform. We continue to focus on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com which provides consumers with another place to book an air ticket. Booking.com's live offering was an important part of our total Q1 73% year-over-year increase in air tickets which was an acceleration from the year-over-year growth in Q4 of 61%. We will continue this important work to provide travelers with the best possible flight booking experience. Though AI has received significant attention recently, we began our investments in AI years ago. We believe then and we continue to believe now that we can build a more compelling and differentiated offering if we can leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience, a connected trip that would be more responsive to a booker's needs and help manage different aspects of their trips. We believe we are well positioned in this area, given that we have been using AI extensively for years in order to optimize interactions with our customers who are both travelers and partners. This goes from personalizing interactions and recommendations to machine translation in over 40 languages and dialects to analyze in the content, the pictures provided by customers and partners, to optimizing value for our customers and many, many more. Over the years, we have built a strong team of AI experts across the company and we keep current with the latest AI research through Booking.com's collaborations with universities. This enables us to quickly react, adapt and learn how our traveller customers and supplier partners can benefit from new developments in the field. We are always looking for new ways to make customer interaction smoother and richer, realizing our ambition to make it easier for everyone to experience the world and to deliver our Connected Trip vision. Much of the recent attention has been on large language models or LLM which provide a multitude of interesting possibilities for improving all areas of travel searching, booking and experiencing. Two interesting possibilities are interactive itinerary building and answering travelers questions. Though there are current challenges given current LLM sometimes produce inaccurate outputs. Nevertheless, we are excited to be exploring how we can make use of these technologies for the benefit of our customers. Some of our brands, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are experimenting regenerative AI plug-ins, while others are building ways to integrate the technology into their own offerings. It is, as we all know, very early days but I am confident in our company's ability to benefit from these developments and improve our products for our customers given our experience in AI, our travel-related data and our human and financial capital, our strategic priorities, including the Connected Trip vision and to improve the experience for our customers and drive more value and benefits to them. But it's important to note that when we think about customers, we have 2 equally important customer groups to consider, our supply partners and our travelers. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, from traditional hotels to the vacation rental on the beach, to everything in between. We believe we can add value to these partners across the spectrum of accommodation types by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. In the area of alternative accommodations, we are seeing encouraging progress at Booking.com with alternative combination of room nights in the first quarter, increasing about 45% year-over-year and representing about 33% of Booking.com's total room nights which is 2 percentage points higher than in Q1 2022. In the U.S., our mix of alternative accommodation room nights, while still low relative to our global mix, has increased meaningfully in the first quarter, reaching highest level ever and was also our absolute highest room nights in U.S. alternative accommodations ever. We are seeing continued momentum in terms of supply growth, both globally and in the U.S. for alternative accommodations, with global listings reaching about 6.7 million by the end of the first quarter which is about 2% higher than year-end 2022. We have seen great traction with the adoption of our enhanced payment solution for alternative accommodation partners in the U.S. We believe rolling out this solution along with other product enhancements last year, including partner liability insurance and an enhanced damage policy is helping to bring more professional supply online to our platform. In addition, we are seeing our alternative accommodation properties across our major regions, achieving improvements in productivity and our new partners are receiving their first booking on our platform earlier. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product offering to our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms in the first quarter continued to increase and reached the highest first quarter level ever. We see a very high level of direct bookings from the mobile app which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. Just over 45% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the first quarter which is a few percentage points higher than in Q1 2022. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we are seeing here. Another way that we build a better experience and deliver value to our travelers is going through our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com. Simplicity is a core principle of Genius where our travelers get the benefits from the program right away. Over time, we've enhanced these benefits, including the creation of a top-tier level of Genius and we will continue to find ways to deliver incremental value to our travelers through this program. Finally, we published our 2022 sustainability report last month which provides an update on the progress we have made against the goals laid out in our climate action plan. We are proud of the emissions reductions achieved and ambitious targets set out for our business. But as I said before, we believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through making it easier for travelers to find and book sustainable options. We're addressing this opportunity through our work with our travel sustainable bag program which now includes over 400,000 properties that can highlight their sustainable practices to customers on Booking.com and that program has been expanded to Priceline, Agoda and KAYAK. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the continued strength of travel demand we are seeing so far this year as well as our team's execution against our key strategic priorities. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers, both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\nDavid Goulden: Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the first quarter as well as our thoughts for Q2 and for the year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will be posting our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. Before getting into details for Q1, I want to remind you that our business is quite seasonal. Q1 is typically a strong booking quarter and we incur marketing expenses in Q1 for many bookings that will stay in future quarters which is when the revenue is recognized. Q1 has also historically been our seasonally smaller revenue quarter and adjusted EBITDA quarter. This means that Q1 adjusted EBITDA can be quite sensitive to the level of bookings we get in the quarter. With the increasing mix of payments at Booking.com, Q1 is also becoming a strong cash flow quarter due to high level of bookings. So now let me go on to our numbers for the first quarter. We were encouraged to see strong year-over-year room night growth of 38% in the first quarter which is better than our expectations. For the first quarter, Asia was up 100%. Europe and rest of world were both up more than 30%. We continue to see growth in the U.S. which was up high single digits versus the prior year. Our growth in total room nights versus 2019 increased from 10% in Q4 to 26% in Q1. In the first quarter, U.S. was up more than 30% and all other regions were up about 25% versus 2019. The booking windows -- our Booking.com expanded versus 2019 for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, driven by Europe and the U.S. The booking window in the first quarter was longer than we expected due to strong levels of bookings for travel in the summer period. I note that many of these bookings are cancelable. Our mobile apps represented over 45% of our total room nights in the first quarter, similar to the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of 2022. The international mix of our total room nights in Q1 was about 53% which was the highest quarterly mix since 2019 but still a couple of percentage points below Q1 2019. Our cancellation rates in the first quarter were below Q1 2022 and Q1 2019. For our alternative accommodations of Booking.com, our Q1 room night growth rate was about 45% year-on-year and the global mix alternative accommodation room nights was about 33% which was higher than about 31% in Q1 2022. We are pleased with the progress we made in North America alternative accomodations where growth in the first quarter was much stronger than the global average. Q1 gross bookings increased 44% year-over-year or 52% on a constant currency basis. The 44% increase in gross bookings was 6 percentage points higher than the 38% room night increase due to 9% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple of points from strong flight booking growth, partially offset by the 8 percentage points of negative impact from FX movements. Accommodation in constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by about 5 percentage points from regional mix due to Asia room nights growing the fastest of all our regions and U.S. growing the slowest. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 14 percentage points year-on-year due to rate increases in all of our regions. Despite the higher ADRs in the first quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up about 73% year-over-year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the first quarter was up 40% year-on-year or about 47% on a constant currency basis. Although we had stronger-than-expected Q1 from a room night and gross booking point of view, the outperformance versus our expectations was driven by bookings that will stay in future quarters. As a result, we did not see revenue benefit in Q1 from these incremental bookings. The lower-than-expected take rate in Q1 was entirely driven by the timing effects. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense which is a highly variable expense line increased 32% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 30 basis points lower than Q1 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1 was about 20 basis points lower than last year which is better than our expectations of being slightly higher. Relative to our expectations, this was due to better ROIs in our paid channels as well as phasing of merchandising spend which is tied to revenues. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 15 basis points compared with last year which was better than our expectations. About 45% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q1, up from about 34% in Q1 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 25% year-on-year which was higher than our expectations due to a few factors that impacted personnel and indirect taxes. The 25% year-over-year growth excludes $39 million in accruals related to potential settlements of indirect tax [indiscernible] recorded in G&A. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. Adjusted EBITDA was $586 million in the quarter which was up 89% year-over-year and would have been up 111% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was lower than our expectations, impacted by marketing expenses incurred for the higher-than-expected gross bookings stage in future quarters. February and March bookings came in stronger than we expected at the time of our prior guidance. These extra bookings also negatively impacted our take rate more than expected for the quarter. If we look at marketing and merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1 to eliminate the timing difference, this was lower than our expectations and lower than both Q1 2022 and Q1 2019. Non-GAAP net income of $440 million resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.60 per share which was up 197% year-on-year. Our average share count in the first quarter was 8% below Q1 2022 and 16% below Q1 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $266 million in the quarter. As a reminder, every profit metric we highlighted in these quarterly earnings report includes the negative impact of stock-based compensation expense because we view SBC expense at a very real cost of doing business. We continue to manage SBC very carefully and it continues to be a very low percentage of our operating cash flow. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of $15.3 billion was up slightly versus our Q4 ending balance of $15.2 billion. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 70% year-on-year. And our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, up 77% year-on-year. The operating and free cash flow generated in the quarter benefited from $2.3 billion in change in working capital due to an increase in our deferred merchant booking balance as well as the $586 million in adjusted EBITDA. The $2.8 billion of free cash flow was mostly offset by about $2 billion in share repurchase in Q1 and the payment of about $500 million for debt to mature in March. Now, on to our thoughts for the second quarter of 2023. In April, we continued to see strong demand with room night growth versus 2019 that was slightly higher than the 26% growth saw in the first quarter, with all of our major regions growing at similar rates. The booking window in April at Booking.com continues to be long as it was in 2019. On a year-on-year basis, April room night growth was in the mid-teens which is lower than Q1 due to a more difficult prior year comparison. You will recall that last year, Q1 room nights were 9% below 2019 and April was up 10%. April 2022 was our first month of growth versus 2019 since the onset of the pandemic. Our comments on the second quarter make the assumption that room night growth will be up mid-single digits year-over-year. As you'll recall, Q1 last year was impacted by Omicron. And in Q2, we saw a strong recovery which resulted in Q2 2022 being our highest growth quarter versus 2019, especially May and June which were our highest growth months last year. Compared with 2019, we'd expect future room night growth in 2023 to be just over 20%, assuming some moderation from growth from the first quarter in April when room nights were helped by more bookings we expected for the summer. We expect Q2 gross bookings to grow about 4 points faster room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and slightly higher constant currency ADRs. We expect Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be approximately 120 basis points above last year due to a less negative impact from timing and increased revenue from payments, partially offset by an increased investment in merchandising and a higher mix of flights. We may see less of an increase in our take rate if booking trends exceed our expectations, especially in the high percentage of these bookings [indiscernible] stays in future quarters. This could also result in higher-than-expected marketing expense in the quarter. We expect Q2 marketing expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year due to an increase in direct mix. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 to be about in line with last year. We expect Q2 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than last year due to higher merchant gross bookings mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q2 to grow about 25% year-over-year due to higher personnel and related expenses, indirect taxes and IT expenses. Taking all this into account, we'd expect future adjusted EBITDA to be around 35% higher than last year. In terms of our outlook for the year, we are not updating our previous full year commentary at this time. Our strong bookings in the first 4 months of the year created the potential for some upside but we want to see how the next few months develop before considering any updated commentary. We continue to expect that our adjusted EBITDA margin will expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we're pleased with our Q1 results and the very strong growth in bookings for the summer. We'll now move to Q&A and Rob, could you please open the lines?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America.\nJustin Post: I guess 2 things. First, when you look at ROI in the marketing channels, how do you feel about that going into the summer? Are you seeing some advantages based on changes from some of your competitors? And then secondly, as you think about your overall use of cash, any reason why you can't just put buybacks to work for the next 5 years? Are there anything we should be thinking about on the debt side?\nGlenn Fogel: Well, Justin, why don't I take the second and then I'll let David talk specifically about ROIs and marketing and thoughts on that going forward. So I think we've been fairly clear in the past about how we view the company and how we believe our free cash flow should be used. And the first thing we always want to see is how can we invest that money appropriately in the company, build out services in ways that we can make the way we work with our partners and our traveller customers in a better way to help build this franchise. That's the first thing absolutely important. And after that, we say, well, we can't build it organically. Is there something outside the company, we think that could add value make things better for both, again, our traveller customers and our partner customers. And the last thing is, okay, if we don't see a good use of that, then we should be somehow returning that capital to our shareholders which is what we laid out the last quarter, we laid out our buyback program, where we had $4 million left in the previous authorization, $20 billion in the next one, that made $24 billion total. And then we said that over the next 4 years, we expect to be able to complete the full authorization. And I believe we've given out some numbers about our buyback now. And I am thrilled with the way we're doing this. But for long term, 5 years, this is what we laid out. Things can always change but that's the way we've laid it out. And I'll leave it up to David, in terms of ROIs, anything you're seeing differently about the summer, I have myself, maybe you see something.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. Justin, I think it's hard to predict what's going to happen to ROIs that far out. So what I will say is that you can see that we saw some encouraging ROI trends compared to expectations in the first quarter. Those were a little bit related to what happened to our bookings profile. So as we mentioned, we got a lot of extra bookings for the summer in the first quarter, more than we would have expected. The ROIs in the pay channels were better than expected due to basically 3 things: higher ADR, a lower cancellation rate and longer-than-expected average length of stay. So we were bidding -- so basically, that was tied to the expansion of the booking window. So the expansion -- the booking window is quite close to correlate to what we saw in terms of good ROI performance in the first quarter. I've just always maintain the point these are highly competitive channels, many players in them and relative to your question on competitive dynamic and nothing really to talk about is different.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: I just want to ask about the Asia Pacific travel and China travel. Are you already seeing the impact of China outbound travel? And then within Asia Pacific, it sounds like that's the strongest region. Are there any particular markets that are performing well for you?\nGlenn Fogel: Mark, sorry about that. Let me take that part 2 ways because I know last time, I believe you asked about China outbound then too, if I recall correctly. And so China is not a significant part at all of our very strong Asia growth in the first quarter. And I want to make it clear that China is still not anywhere near it was in 2019 and outbound. It is coming back in terms of overall market coming back but there's still shortages of lift there. It is getting better than it was in January when there was a think mid-teens number of available airlift out of China outbound is coming back. I'll be probably honest with you, we are seeing more growth, obviously, in other parts of Asia. We're very pleased with the very strong growth we're seeing. I don't believe that we're going to break down individual countries but I do see that this is an area of growth for us that I'm very pleased about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from UBS.\nLloyd Walmsley: Two, if I can. First, just going back to the higher marketing ROI. Like how much of that is you all proactively managing to higher targets versus just the competitive market, maybe softening up in marketing channels and like do you think this is durable? And do you think we should think of this as a reflection of kind of normalizing consumer demand? And then the second one is just anything you're seeing in terms of just price consciousness among consumers either trading down at all or taking shorter trips to compensate for higher ADRs. Anything you'd call out there in any of your big markets.\nGlenn Fogel: Let me take the second one because I do look at that very carefully to see are there any smoke signals coming out of the market, giving us any indication of any changes. And I have not seen any decline in the star ratings that people are going for nor are we seeing a decrease in the length of stays, either one of which could increase that potential softening in the market and we have not seen that yet. And I think we made the remark about the booking window has gone out further indicating confidence, I believe, that's one hypothesis I want to point out, confidence about the future willing to put your money down and be willing to book for further out. That can be seen upon [indiscernible] is that people are concerned there's not going to be enough availability or they could be considered that prices are going to continue to rise, they will lock it in now, that's another way to look at too but none of those hypotheses to say anything about a weakness at all. And in terms of I think your first question, I'll leave it to David.\nDavid Goulden: In terms of -- Lloyd, let me just remind you that this is a year that we still expect to be leaning into marketing and merchandising because we believe there's recovery in the travel market available to us. And I think that our growth rates relative to the market demonstrates that we're making progress there. If you remember, we started off the year by saying we expect our marketing and merchandising investment to be roughly the same as it was as a percentage of gross bookings, same as it was in 2022, we still expect that to be the case. Remember, we said that 2022 was a year which we look out of leaning in and making more investment relative to gross bookings that we did in 2019. And that story for us hasn't changed. We believe that we want to continue to lean in this year to continue to gain share in a recovery marketplace. And the fact that we saw some improvement in Q1, as I mentioned in my -- in the answer to my question to Justin, what to do with the kind of shape of our booking profile and the booking window and getting more summer bookings with higher transaction values than we would expect it to get from a mix point of view in Q1 and actually why the ROIs came in better. But we still plan to believe in the industry. And as I said in Q2 and for the full year, we still expect that investment in marketing and merchandising to be as it was in 2022.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.\nBrian Nowak: I have two. The first one is on the direct mix of traffic, the percentage of the business is direct. You've made a lot of progress on that over the last year or so, a couple of years, Glenn. If you break it down by region, where have you made the most progress in increasing the percentage of the business that's direct? And how should we think about how high that is? And what are the regions that you have the most runway to sort of drive that percentage of the business that's direct up longer? And then, the second one on your forecasting. You guys have a lot of data and you're very good at forecasting. It seems like demand really came through better than you thought throughout the quarter. Which regions sort of drove that outsized demand versus your forecasting?\nGlenn Fogel: So we don't break down the direct mix by region at all. But I can repeat things I've said in the past about how important direct mix is to the long-term increase the value of the franchise because of things we talk about with our connected trip. They're getting people in through the app primarily, having them understand all the different things we'll be able to offer to them, give them a real personalized thing that will make them want to always come back to us. The more we learn about them, the more they come back to us. So it's a flywheel effect happening there. Again, I won't break it down by region but my goal is to have every region have as many people as possible using the app and coming directly. That's the first thing. In terms of how we varied against our forecast, I don't know how much. David, why don't you get into that?\nDavid Goulden: You can see that -- obviously, we did significantly better on the top line. And I think the place to go to -- I'd say it was fairly balanced across all regions. Obviously, the price we sold on booking window expand the most was in U.S. and Europe. So that's where we got a higher share of summer bookings than we expected to get in Q1. But you see also Asia did very well. And in general, also exceeded our expectations but we didn't have the booking window phenomena there. So I wouldn't call out any particular region but I will call out some of the differences in what we saw across the regions that contributed to the overachievement.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Glenn, I just wanted to revisit on AI. Can you just talk about some of the advantages that booking would have in leveraging generative AI versus what other external or potentially new travel services might provide? And do you feel the need to protect the data on your platform to keep it from being used for training broadly across many large language models?\nGlenn Fogel: Thanks, Doug and very interesting questions about that and I'll break it out into -- you start off with AI, then we went to a specific subset of degenerative AI. Let's just talk in general about AI first and how important this is into our business for many, many, many years, more than a decade perhaps, a machine learning model that really helped us do a better job making sure that what we're presenting to consumer, for example, is really something that they have a higher percentage chance they're going to convert on that. All sorts of ways that we use, very sophisticated machine learning models in many parts of the business that have helped us get us where we are today. Then of course, we come out in the fold, something that is -- the somewhat a lot of people were not that aware of this generative AI, large language models and see what could be done with them. And clearly, anytime there's a major shift in technology, everyone thinks like, well, is this going to be disruptive to the players who are already doing well? Is it not? And I said in my prepared remarks, how I feel very confident of where we are in this because of the work we've done in AI in the past, the number of people we've had working on, the amount of capital we have, our collaborations with universities. I believe that we are going to be benefiting greatly from this new type of technology in many different areas and some we haven't any thought of them yet and some things are going to be easy, perhaps increasing the productivity of our developers which we believe is hopefully going to achieve some very good results in the hopefully not so distant future, to things that perhaps are further away but ways that people interact with us in that connected trip vision, a way that you really do are able to recreate that human travel agent into something that's actually an automated player but is that does so much better than the human being did in the past? Now in terms of your very important question about the data and how do we protect it and not litigate it out and be used by others, that is a very important thing. And everyone from our attorneys to people in our development departments, people who are really working with some of these large language model foundational model people, we are looking very closely. Have they already been using our data and should they be -- and I think there's going to be a lot of interesting regulations in this area that nobody knows the answer yet, too but how will people become and say -- if they're data has been used in the past for training purposes or not. And I think it's a very open question that nobody knows the answer to yet but we will be very interested in the results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman from TD Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Yes. First question, I wanted to ask about ADR's big area of interest. With all the strength you're seeing in Q1, could you just -- and quarter to date, can you touch on how ADRs have trended generally compared to what you're seeing as of the last call.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. So when we gave you some data on the call, I mean ADRs are still trending positively. They're up on a year-on-year basis and they're up in -- across all regions on a year-on-year basis. So we're not seeing any slowdown in ADRs. And when we -- we've been looking at some of the things, I'm sure, behind your question but we're not seeing a reduction in ADRs in any region on a year-on-year basis or on a year-on-year basis. So we see ADRs continue to hold very strongly.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. And then, one other question. Could you talk about a little bit about the dynamics in the U.S. market. What are you seeing in the U.S. that's causing your growth to be a little bit slower there? And how do you feel about your market share in the U.S.\nDavid Goulden: We feel that obviously, our U.S. business is still growing very, very strongly compared to 2019. And we have -- seeing that growth relative to 2019 come down a little bit. But we feel that a part -- we still feel it's -- when you look at how our business is vis-\u00e0-vis 2019 is significantly bigger than it was before and it's still growing at a very healthy rate vis-\u00e0-vis 2019. So we don't really worry about that.\nGlenn Fogel: And I would just add, my conversations with our partner, some of our biggest partners and with their senior management, the critical thing for me is, are we providing them with what they need? Are we providing incremental business to them that helps them do better in their business? And do you feel that we are valuable to what you need. And I only heard positive things from all the people that I speak to in regards to where we are today versus where we were in the past. And it's a much more complementary relationship and I believe that will help us in the future to continue to build on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz from Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Maybe sticking with some of the comments around direct. You guys continue to post impressive direct booking results and app growth. Maybe looking beyond this year, how does this price of execution within the direct channel inform the way you see margin progression beyond 2023? And then, maybe one on VR. [Indiscernible] continue to indicate that you guys seem to be picking up some share in the U.S. vacation rental market, an area where you've been perhaps underrepresented. I guess what do you owe maybe some of the improvements you're seeing within the U.S. VR industry? And then looking forward, what are the things you think you can you need to continue to do in order to really scale up that business in line with some of your competitors?\nGlenn Fogel: So why don't I start Lee -- going to start with -- as you put it up VR, vacation rental -- I'd like to use alternative accommodation. Neither one is a great customer-friendly term, of course. Let me talk about that and then I'll let David talk about the direct business of what that may or may not indicate when you go into the share in terms of margins down the road. And I talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks about some of the things we are doing in terms of the alternative accommodations area in the U.S. to build that business and you were very polite to say that maybe -- that we may under index where we said, it's very nice to say because I continue to admit that in the past, we have not been hitting that as well as we showed that we were behind where I thought we should be, especially since we do fairly well in that in other parts world, particularly in Europe. Things that we've been doing are things that I talk about, first of all, is you got to make sure you're providing a good service to the people who own the home, who own the apartments. Are we doing things like liability insurance. Well, now we have something like that. Damage waiver type stuff. So we have that. Yes, we do. Last time I talked about how we were testing out an ability to request to book because some people or properties, they don't want to have automatic booking. They want to have a request to book system, so we are developing out back. Once you start getting that in, you had start saying, well, are people aware of your product? Because as I said, there wasn't a lot of -- people didn't have a lot of knowledge that we had such a product. And I was just to joke that if you went down in New York City and you said something on the street and said, I need a place in the Hamptons, where shall I go, I could almost guarantee you they weren't going to say Booking.com. Well, we need to get that supplies once we have it, then we got to make people aware that we have the supplies. We have to build all that. So there's nothing miracle about this. This is [indiscernible] tackling business 101. Get your supply out there, make it attractive and then make sure people know about it and that's what we've been doing, cranking away at it. And I'm pleased and I said it's really nice to see us starting to hit it. It can come up with their mix in the U.S. at all-time high in terms of alternative accommodation in part of our total mix, along with having absolute number of alternative accommodation room night bookings. So I am pleased with the progress that we're making and I know that we had to continue that because I know customers like this product and this is an area where we have growth possibilities. And David, regarding direct only, do you want to?\nDavid Goulden: Sure. Direct mix obviously is very tied to our strategy. Our strategy is to build a better product, provide better service for our customers and partners and get those customers to come back to us more frequently and more directly after we've acquired them in the first place to which shall we bring them into the portfolio the first time around. So it really does tie to executing against our strategy and lots of things that we do, many things that we do contribute to that better products. I could talk about alternative accommodation, I can talk about payments, we can talk about adding flights to all these things just create a better service for our customer and therefore, we're more likely to get them back directly. So it's very much tied to our strategy. It is also tied to your financial model because we made the comment last quarter on February, that we're obviously not targeting pre-COVID margin level because of the mix shift in the business for some of these new areas that we're now focused in but we do expect to be able to grow our EBITDA margin above the levels we're at in 2023 and the biggest driver, that would be continue to increase our direct mix. We'd also expect to be able to do better from a leverage on our more fixed costs going forward. And those themselves would kind of more than offset the pressure from the mix of lower-margin businesses as they grow within our portfolio. So continuing to improve our direct mix is very important for both the strategy and the financial model and will be the major sources to be able to provide some margin expansion beyond where we are this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: Hoping you could update us on your strategy in the U.S. market. You've had a lot of success gaining share in recent years but I'm curious if you could update us on your learning so far about sort of the return on investments and how that's informing your aspirations to continue pursuing that opportunity as aggressively as you have been? And second, you sort of characterized investing ahead of the travel recovery to gain share throughout 2021 and 2022. I'm curious if that's your strategy in the Asia Pacific region as that market recovers. And if you have any early reads on returns on that investment.\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So I'll start off by saying that I'm very pleased with how the strategy has been working out in the U.S. given our gain in share. As David mentioned, we have a bigger business than we did in 2019. It's been growing nicely. I really do think that it's achieving what we've been trying to accomplish which is to not be the under-indexed player than we were in the past and we're making good progress there. In terms of the absolute ROIs on these things, we don't break them out by region at all. But I will say that, obviously, we are very conscious of spending money the right way to get the right return. And we are -- came out of the business. Previously, I was in China. I know how important is to make sure that you're getting your money's worth to where you're spending it and we are doing that. Now, I think it's just going forward strategy work and to see us continuing in the same thing. And in terms of Asia, it was not dissimilar that we want to make sure when people are going to start traveling, we don't want to wait until you're halfway down the track to get out of the gate. That would not be the best move. Get out in front, be there when the traveller wants to start traveling and providing them with what they want. And that we've been doing and we just talked a little bit about how we were very pleased with the first quarter for Asia growth. And I think, hopefully, it will continue the same way.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research.\nZachary Morrissey: Great. This is Zach on for Deepak. Just first on the fixed cost [indiscernible] you -- or I guess the first half is kind of tracking above the kind of 20% growth that you kind of outlined last quarter. And the 1Q to 2Q is also kind of sequentially stepping up a little bit here. Just curious on your thoughts on how we should think about the fixed cost growth kind of maybe sequentially kind of into the back half of the year and into next year? And then second on just the buybacks. I think 1Q came in this stronger than we were expecting. Just curious how we should think about kind of the puts and takes in terms of the cadence of buybacks through the rest of the year, is 1Q kind of a good run rate? Or how should we think of that?\nGlenn Fogel: David, you're the owner of the P&L there, looking that you want to take on the cost.\nDavid Goulden: Yes. On the cost side, yes, I mean, we talked about being 25% in the first quarter -- we talked about being 25% in the second quarter. So obviously, that's going to put a little bit of pressure on our guidance for the full year. But what I'd say just generally, when you look at anything that's in the kind of full year view, we've not updated our guidance, there are going to be some -- likely go to be some puts and takes for the full year at the line item level but we're not going to update that line item detail today other than just recommit that we'll have a margin expansion by a couple of points versus 2022. Remember, next year, we said that we do expect our fixed cost to grow more slowly next year than we expect them to grow this year and that continues to be the case.\nGlenn Fogel: And regarding buybacks, I think we laid it out a little bit. You know what our plan is. You know what we're doing. And I'm not sure there's any more color I can give and we're pleased with where we are.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly from Oppenheimer.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Josh [ph] on for Jed. Just wondering, if you can maybe speak to how recent improvements in payments is resonating with U.S. property managers and their opportunity to increase share?\nGlenn Fogel: Sure, Josh. Payments is an important part of the business. I've talked in the past about how it's the glue that brings everything together, along with making it easier for both the customer traveller and for the partner. And I think the growth in the amount of our business going through payments is a good indicator that is working and being accepted well. Customers have choice, both the traveller and the partner. Both of them can choose to use the payments or not. The fact that it's going up to me would be proof positive that people are finding it useful. And I believe in the long run, it's very -- being very, very helpful as we continue to build out the connected trip further.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.\nStephen Ju: So Glenn and David, your merchant booking dollars are now at parity with your agency dollars. So just wondering how much of this is due to the ramp in air versus a more proactive choice to consumer may be making and they're lodging product selections -- to your point earlier, to alternative accommodations. And I guess doing more merchant and the rise in deferred merchant bookings there should improve your free cash flow generation. So does this change your capital allocation plans a little bit?\nDavid Goulden: On the second question, no, the capital allocation plan that we talked about last quarter, that Glenn summarized earlier, anticipated that we would be continuing to increase our merchant mix. So on that piece, there is no change. In terms of where is that merchant increase coming from, just to remind us all, it's really coming from a mix shift inside of Booking.com where we are moving from what used to be almost entirely an agency model now to a much more balanced model. That is the biggest change would be in accommodations. That's still, by far, the biggest part of the business, although our flights grows, it's having an impact. But what's really driving the changes that you're seeing is the increase in merchant mix across our accommodations business, our Booking.com.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Two here. Can you guys maybe give us an updated outlook on ADRs. I think previously, you talked about expectation being maybe flattish on constant currency for FY '23. And also, David, maybe you can remind us -- talk about some of the puts and takes on take rate for your expectation for 2020.\nDavid Goulden: We said that we expect our ADRs for the second quarter just to kind of continue the picture. We expect our ADRs for the second quarter to be up slightly on on-year basis. As I mentioned in one of my earlier answers, we're not out -- we're not updating every single line item on our full year guidance. But if they continue to hold at the current level, there may be a little bit of upside compared to what we said on the last call on ADRs. As I said, there'll be some puts and takes up and down our full set of guidance. But we're not specifically updating our guidance or giving you anything beyond what we're talking about for Q2. We'll have to wait and see how that all develops. But I think you can see from where we were in Q1, plus what we're expecting in Q2, things are trending positively.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Richard Clarke from Bernstein.\nRichard Clarke: Just the first question was what is the ability for you to continue to get discounts from your hotels? I know the Genius discounts tend to be hotel-funded. And in this travel environment, are they more or less likely to give those? And is that influencing your level of merchandising at all? And could that change if the travel environment altered towards the back half.\nGlenn Fogel: Richard, look, there's no doubt that hotels, when they are doing well may see less of a need to use all other ways to distribute and get business, then just have to come to them direct, right? And one of the things they're always looking at is what's the return. So with us in Genius, it's really being very targeted with them to make sure they understand how we can get the incremental demand that they wouldn't necessarily be able to get otherwise and then working with them and make sure is this value for them or not. And something I actually talked a bit in the past, I'm not sure on a call but our sales people have worked with hoteliers and talk to them sometimes, well, we're working with Genius program -- the Genius program in or that it's not actually the best use of their money in the best way for the business and told them, look, don't think you should use Genius this way, this amount, this time, whatever other time, etcetera. This is an idea long term, having a good partnership. It's just -- it's not just knocking down the door of hotel, give us discuss, give us discount. That's not how this works. This works with science. This starts with data. This is the machine learning stuff I talked about in the past. This is getting together to come up with a way that we can come up with a better way to improve their business. Now no doubt, as travel improves and such, there's going to be less of a need as the hotels will find other ways and perhaps less expensive ways or more efficient ways for them. And so maybe there will be some place but I am not at all concerned if your point is that this is going to make a drastic difference to how we do our business in the future. I don't see it. I see this as something that's going up more and more central as we continue to develop more ways to provide value to the traveller customer and be able to work with the customer supplier partner in ways that are complementary, symbiotic for all of us that we all win in this, the traveller wins, the hotel winds and we win.\nRichard Clarke: Okay, perfect sense. Maybe just a little technical question after. You talked about -- you've got $19 billion of merchant bookings in the quarter. You've talked about longer booking windows but your deferred merchant booking is only at $4.5 billion. Just trying to square the gap between the $19 billion and the $4.5 billion that we see there.\nGlenn Fogel: Richard, you're confusing me on this one.\nDavid Goulden: Richard, you [indiscernible] spoke on that one.\nRichard Clarke: The deferred merchant booking line which is $4.5 billion on your balance sheet, how does that square with you getting $19 billion of bookings -- merchant bookings in the quarter that you're saying are largely for future quarters?\nDavid Goulden: Richard, why don't we follow up with you offline on that one and try and progress all down? Just to understand the question, make sure we get you the answer. And if others want -- just to give us the answer, we can follow up to them as well. But we'll touch base with you offline. John will call you back.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Glenn Fogel, I turn the call back over to you.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. So as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you, everyone and good night.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "David Goulden",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the first quarter as well as our thoughts for Q2 and for the year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will be posting our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. Before getting into details for Q1, I want to remind you that our business is quite seasonal. Q1 is typically a strong booking quarter and we incur marketing expenses in Q1 for many bookings that will stay in future quarters which is when the revenue is recognized. Q1 has also historically been our seasonally smaller revenue quarter and adjusted EBITDA quarter. This means that Q1 adjusted EBITDA can be quite sensitive to the level of bookings we get in the quarter. With the increasing mix of payments at Booking.com, Q1 is also becoming a strong cash flow quarter due to high level of bookings. So now let me go on to our numbers for the first quarter. We were encouraged to see strong year-over-year room night growth of 38% in the first quarter which is better than our expectations. For the first quarter, Asia was up 100%. Europe and rest of world were both up more than 30%. We continue to see growth in the U.S. which was up high single digits versus the prior year. Our growth in total room nights versus 2019 increased from 10% in Q4 to 26% in Q1. In the first quarter, U.S. was up more than 30% and all other regions were up about 25% versus 2019. The booking windows -- our Booking.com expanded versus 2019 for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, driven by Europe and the U.S. The booking window in the first quarter was longer than we expected due to strong levels of bookings for travel in the summer period. I note that many of these bookings are cancelable. Our mobile apps represented over 45% of our total room nights in the first quarter, similar to the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of 2022. The international mix of our total room nights in Q1 was about 53% which was the highest quarterly mix since 2019 but still a couple of percentage points below Q1 2019. Our cancellation rates in the first quarter were below Q1 2022 and Q1 2019. For our alternative accommodations of Booking.com, our Q1 room night growth rate was about 45% year-on-year and the global mix alternative accommodation room nights was about 33% which was higher than about 31% in Q1 2022. We are pleased with the progress we made in North America alternative accomodations where growth in the first quarter was much stronger than the global average. Q1 gross bookings increased 44% year-over-year or 52% on a constant currency basis. The 44% increase in gross bookings was 6 percentage points higher than the 38% room night increase due to 9% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple of points from strong flight booking growth, partially offset by the 8 percentage points of negative impact from FX movements. Accommodation in constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by about 5 percentage points from regional mix due to Asia room nights growing the fastest of all our regions and U.S. growing the slowest. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 14 percentage points year-on-year due to rate increases in all of our regions. Despite the higher ADRs in the first quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the first quarter were up about 73% year-over-year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the first quarter was up 40% year-on-year or about 47% on a constant currency basis. Although we had stronger-than-expected Q1 from a room night and gross booking point of view, the outperformance versus our expectations was driven by bookings that will stay in future quarters. As a result, we did not see revenue benefit in Q1 from these incremental bookings. The lower-than-expected take rate in Q1 was entirely driven by the timing effects. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense which is a highly variable expense line increased 32% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 30 basis points lower than Q1 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1 was about 20 basis points lower than last year which is better than our expectations of being slightly higher. Relative to our expectations, this was due to better ROIs in our paid channels as well as phasing of merchandising spend which is tied to revenues. Sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 15 basis points compared with last year which was better than our expectations. About 45% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q1, up from about 34% in Q1 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 25% year-on-year which was higher than our expectations due to a few factors that impacted personnel and indirect taxes. The 25% year-over-year growth excludes $39 million in accruals related to potential settlements of indirect tax [indiscernible] recorded in G&A. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully. Adjusted EBITDA was $586 million in the quarter which was up 89% year-over-year and would have been up 111% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was lower than our expectations, impacted by marketing expenses incurred for the higher-than-expected gross bookings stage in future quarters. February and March bookings came in stronger than we expected at the time of our prior guidance. These extra bookings also negatively impacted our take rate more than expected for the quarter. If we look at marketing and merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1 to eliminate the timing difference, this was lower than our expectations and lower than both Q1 2022 and Q1 2019. Non-GAAP net income of $440 million resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.60 per share which was up 197% year-on-year. Our average share count in the first quarter was 8% below Q1 2022 and 16% below Q1 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $266 million in the quarter. As a reminder, every profit metric we highlighted in these quarterly earnings report includes the negative impact of stock-based compensation expense because we view SBC expense at a very real cost of doing business. We continue to manage SBC very carefully and it continues to be a very low percentage of our operating cash flow. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of $15.3 billion was up slightly versus our Q4 ending balance of $15.2 billion. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 70% year-on-year. And our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, up 77% year-on-year. The operating and free cash flow generated in the quarter benefited from $2.3 billion in change in working capital due to an increase in our deferred merchant booking balance as well as the $586 million in adjusted EBITDA. The $2.8 billion of free cash flow was mostly offset by about $2 billion in share repurchase in Q1 and the payment of about $500 million for debt to mature in March. Now, on to our thoughts for the second quarter of 2023. In April, we continued to see strong demand with room night growth versus 2019 that was slightly higher than the 26% growth saw in the first quarter, with all of our major regions growing at similar rates. The booking window in April at Booking.com continues to be long as it was in 2019. On a year-on-year basis, April room night growth was in the mid-teens which is lower than Q1 due to a more difficult prior year comparison. You will recall that last year, Q1 room nights were 9% below 2019 and April was up 10%. April 2022 was our first month of growth versus 2019 since the onset of the pandemic. Our comments on the second quarter make the assumption that room night growth will be up mid-single digits year-over-year. As you'll recall, Q1 last year was impacted by Omicron. And in Q2, we saw a strong recovery which resulted in Q2 2022 being our highest growth quarter versus 2019, especially May and June which were our highest growth months last year. Compared with 2019, we'd expect future room night growth in 2023 to be just over 20%, assuming some moderation from growth from the first quarter in April when room nights were helped by more bookings we expected for the summer. We expect Q2 gross bookings to grow about 4 points faster room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and slightly higher constant currency ADRs. We expect Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be approximately 120 basis points above last year due to a less negative impact from timing and increased revenue from payments, partially offset by an increased investment in merchandising and a higher mix of flights. We may see less of an increase in our take rate if booking trends exceed our expectations, especially in the high percentage of these bookings [indiscernible] stays in future quarters. This could also result in higher-than-expected marketing expense in the quarter. We expect Q2 marketing expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year due to an increase in direct mix. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 to be about in line with last year. We expect Q2 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than last year due to higher merchant gross bookings mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q2 to grow about 25% year-over-year due to higher personnel and related expenses, indirect taxes and IT expenses. Taking all this into account, we'd expect future adjusted EBITDA to be around 35% higher than last year. In terms of our outlook for the year, we are not updating our previous full year commentary at this time. Our strong bookings in the first 4 months of the year created the potential for some upside but we want to see how the next few months develop before considering any updated commentary. We continue to expect that our adjusted EBITDA margin will expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022. In closing, we're pleased with our Q1 results and the very strong growth in bookings for the summer. We'll now move to Q&A and Rob, could you please open the lines? Yes. Justin, I think it's hard to predict what's going to happen to ROIs that far out. So what I will say is that you can see that we saw some encouraging ROI trends compared to expectations in the first quarter. Those were a little bit related to what happened to our bookings profile. So as we mentioned, we got a lot of extra bookings for the summer in the first quarter, more than we would have expected. The ROIs in the pay channels were better than expected due to basically 3 things: higher ADR, a lower cancellation rate and longer-than-expected average length of stay. So we were bidding -- so basically, that was tied to the expansion of the booking window. So the expansion -- the booking window is quite close to correlate to what we saw in terms of good ROI performance in the first quarter. I've just always maintain the point these are highly competitive channels, many players in them and relative to your question on competitive dynamic and nothing really to talk about is different. In terms of -- Lloyd, let me just remind you that this is a year that we still expect to be leaning into marketing and merchandising because we believe there's recovery in the travel market available to us. And I think that our growth rates relative to the market demonstrates that we're making progress there. If you remember, we started off the year by saying we expect our marketing and merchandising investment to be roughly the same as it was as a percentage of gross bookings, same as it was in 2022, we still expect that to be the case. Remember, we said that 2022 was a year which we look out of leaning in and making more investment relative to gross bookings that we did in 2019. And that story for us hasn't changed. We believe that we want to continue to lean in this year to continue to gain share in a recovery marketplace. And the fact that we saw some improvement in Q1, as I mentioned in my -- in the answer to my question to Justin, what to do with the kind of shape of our booking profile and the booking window and getting more summer bookings with higher transaction values than we would expect it to get from a mix point of view in Q1 and actually why the ROIs came in better. But we still plan to believe in the industry. And as I said in Q2 and for the full year, we still expect that investment in marketing and merchandising to be as it was in 2022. You can see that -- obviously, we did significantly better on the top line. And I think the place to go to -- I'd say it was fairly balanced across all regions. Obviously, the price we sold on booking window expand the most was in U.S. and Europe. So that's where we got a higher share of summer bookings than we expected to get in Q1. But you see also Asia did very well. And in general, also exceeded our expectations but we didn't have the booking window phenomena there. So I wouldn't call out any particular region but I will call out some of the differences in what we saw across the regions that contributed to the overachievement. Yes. So when we gave you some data on the call, I mean ADRs are still trending positively. They're up on a year-on-year basis and they're up in -- across all regions on a year-on-year basis. So we're not seeing any slowdown in ADRs. And when we -- we've been looking at some of the things, I'm sure, behind your question but we're not seeing a reduction in ADRs in any region on a year-on-year basis or on a year-on-year basis. So we see ADRs continue to hold very strongly. We feel that obviously, our U.S. business is still growing very, very strongly compared to 2019. And we have -- seeing that growth relative to 2019 come down a little bit. But we feel that a part -- we still feel it's -- when you look at how our business is vis-a\u0300-vis 2019 is significantly bigger than it was before and it's still growing at a very healthy rate vis-a\u0300-vis 2019. So we don't really worry about that. Sure. Direct mix obviously is very tied to our strategy. Our strategy is to build a better product, provide better service for our customers and partners and get those customers to come back to us more frequently and more directly after we've acquired them in the first place to which shall we bring them into the portfolio the first time around. So it really does tie to executing against our strategy and lots of things that we do, many things that we do contribute to that better products. I could talk about alternative accommodation, I can talk about payments, we can talk about adding flights to all these things just create a better service for our customer and therefore, we're more likely to get them back directly. So it's very much tied to our strategy. It is also tied to your financial model because we made the comment last quarter on February, that we're obviously not targeting pre-COVID margin level because of the mix shift in the business for some of these new areas that we're now focused in but we do expect to be able to grow our EBITDA margin above the levels we're at in 2023 and the biggest driver, that would be continue to increase our direct mix. We'd also expect to be able to do better from a leverage on our more fixed costs going forward. And those themselves would kind of more than offset the pressure from the mix of lower-margin businesses as they grow within our portfolio. So continuing to improve our direct mix is very important for both the strategy and the financial model and will be the major sources to be able to provide some margin expansion beyond where we are this year. Yes. On the cost side, yes, I mean, we talked about being 25% in the first quarter -- we talked about being 25% in the second quarter. So obviously, that's going to put a little bit of pressure on our guidance for the full year. But what I'd say just generally, when you look at anything that's in the kind of full year view, we've not updated our guidance, there are going to be some -- likely go to be some puts and takes for the full year at the line item level but we're not going to update that line item detail today other than just recommit that we'll have a margin expansion by a couple of points versus 2022. Remember, next year, we said that we do expect our fixed cost to grow more slowly next year than we expect them to grow this year and that continues to be the case. On the second question, no, the capital allocation plan that we talked about last quarter, that Glenn summarized earlier, anticipated that we would be continuing to increase our merchant mix. So on that piece, there is no change. In terms of where is that merchant increase coming from, just to remind us all, it's really coming from a mix shift inside of Booking.com where we are moving from what used to be almost entirely an agency model now to a much more balanced model. That is the biggest change would be in accommodations. That's still, by far, the biggest part of the business, although our flights grows, it's having an impact. But what's really driving the changes that you're seeing is the increase in merchant mix across our accommodations business, our Booking.com. We said that we expect our ADRs for the second quarter just to kind of continue the picture. We expect our ADRs for the second quarter to be up slightly on on-year basis. As I mentioned in one of my earlier answers, we're not out -- we're not updating every single line item on our full year guidance. But if they continue to hold at the current level, there may be a little bit of upside compared to what we said on the last call on ADRs. As I said, there'll be some puts and takes up and down our full set of guidance. But we're not specifically updating our guidance or giving you anything beyond what we're talking about for Q2. We'll have to wait and see how that all develops. But I think you can see from where we were in Q1, plus what we're expecting in Q2, things are trending positively. Richard, you [indiscernible] spoke on that one. Richard, why don't we follow up with you offline on that one and try and progress all down? Just to understand the question, make sure we get you the answer. And if others want -- just to give us the answer, we can follow up to them as well. But we'll touch base with you offline. John will call you back."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report that in the first quarter, we reached all-time quarterly highs for both room nights of $274 million and gross bookings of $39.4 billion and achieved year-over-year growth rates of 38% and 44%, respectively. On a constant currency basis, first quarter gross bookings growth was even stronger at 52% year-over-year. Both room night and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the continued strength in leisure travel demand and from a lengthening booking window, particularly in Europe and the U.S. The room night and gross bookings outperformance versus our expectations was driven by bookings that will stay in future periods which is when the revenue will be recognized. As a result of this timing difference, revenue was approximately in line with our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was a bit below given the additional marketing expenses associated with the future states. When we look at room night growth versus 2019, we have seen a slight increase in April compared with what we saw in the first quarter. Though on a year-over-year basis, growth has decelerated since April last year saw an accelerating travel recovery, making the comparison more difficult. Overall, we remain encouraged by the continued strength and resiliency of travel demand so far this year which speaks to consumers' strong desires to travel. We currently see very strong growth of bookings received for travel during our peak summer period in quarter 3. Though we note, these bookings represent a modest percentage of what will likely be booked for total summer travel and most of these bookings are cancelable. While travel booking trends have remained robust, we recognize that there is uncertainty regarding the path of the global economy. However, we believe we are well positioned to navigate any potential near-term economic uncertainty given our highly variable expense structure, solid operating results, substantial liquidity and strong free cash flow. This allows us to remain focused on what's important for the long term which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our business while remaining cost conscious and implementing initiatives across the business to drive cost efficiency. We continue to make progress on our key strategic priorities, including our long-term Connected Trip vision. The Connected Trip is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveller customers and supplier partners. Our payments platform at Booking.com ties into our Connected Trip vision as payments helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience for our travelers. Those still small today, we are seeing an increase in the mix of transactions that are connected to another book travel component in a trip. We believe continuing to build on this progress will improve the booking experience for more of our customers which we believe will help drive increasing customer engagement with our platform. We continue to focus on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com which provides consumers with another place to book an air ticket. Booking.com's live offering was an important part of our total Q1 73% year-over-year increase in air tickets which was an acceleration from the year-over-year growth in Q4 of 61%. We will continue this important work to provide travelers with the best possible flight booking experience. Though AI has received significant attention recently, we began our investments in AI years ago. We believe then and we continue to believe now that we can build a more compelling and differentiated offering if we can leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience, a connected trip that would be more responsive to a booker's needs and help manage different aspects of their trips. We believe we are well positioned in this area, given that we have been using AI extensively for years in order to optimize interactions with our customers who are both travelers and partners. This goes from personalizing interactions and recommendations to machine translation in over 40 languages and dialects to analyze in the content, the pictures provided by customers and partners, to optimizing value for our customers and many, many more. Over the years, we have built a strong team of AI experts across the company and we keep current with the latest AI research through Booking.com's collaborations with universities. This enables us to quickly react, adapt and learn how our traveller customers and supplier partners can benefit from new developments in the field. We are always looking for new ways to make customer interaction smoother and richer, realizing our ambition to make it easier for everyone to experience the world and to deliver our Connected Trip vision. Much of the recent attention has been on large language models or LLM which provide a multitude of interesting possibilities for improving all areas of travel searching, booking and experiencing. Two interesting possibilities are interactive itinerary building and answering travelers questions. Though there are current challenges given current LLM sometimes produce inaccurate outputs. Nevertheless, we are excited to be exploring how we can make use of these technologies for the benefit of our customers. Some of our brands, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are experimenting regenerative AI plug-ins, while others are building ways to integrate the technology into their own offerings. It is, as we all know, very early days but I am confident in our company's ability to benefit from these developments and improve our products for our customers given our experience in AI, our travel-related data and our human and financial capital, our strategic priorities, including the Connected Trip vision and to improve the experience for our customers and drive more value and benefits to them. But it's important to note that when we think about customers, we have 2 equally important customer groups to consider, our supply partners and our travelers. For our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, from traditional hotels to the vacation rental on the beach, to everything in between. We believe we can add value to these partners across the spectrum of accommodation types by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. In the area of alternative accommodations, we are seeing encouraging progress at Booking.com with alternative combination of room nights in the first quarter, increasing about 45% year-over-year and representing about 33% of Booking.com's total room nights which is 2 percentage points higher than in Q1 2022. In the U.S., our mix of alternative accommodation room nights, while still low relative to our global mix, has increased meaningfully in the first quarter, reaching highest level ever and was also our absolute highest room nights in U.S. alternative accommodations ever. We are seeing continued momentum in terms of supply growth, both globally and in the U.S. for alternative accommodations, with global listings reaching about 6.7 million by the end of the first quarter which is about 2% higher than year-end 2022. We have seen great traction with the adoption of our enhanced payment solution for alternative accommodation partners in the U.S. We believe rolling out this solution along with other product enhancements last year, including partner liability insurance and an enhanced damage policy is helping to bring more professional supply online to our platform. In addition, we are seeing our alternative accommodation properties across our major regions, achieving improvements in productivity and our new partners are receiving their first booking on our platform earlier. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product offering to our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms in the first quarter continued to increase and reached the highest first quarter level ever. We see a very high level of direct bookings from the mobile app which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. Just over 45% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the first quarter which is a few percentage points higher than in Q1 2022. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we are seeing here. Another way that we build a better experience and deliver value to our travelers is going through our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com. Simplicity is a core principle of Genius where our travelers get the benefits from the program right away. Over time, we've enhanced these benefits, including the creation of a top-tier level of Genius and we will continue to find ways to deliver incremental value to our travelers through this program. Finally, we published our 2022 sustainability report last month which provides an update on the progress we have made against the goals laid out in our climate action plan. We are proud of the emissions reductions achieved and ambitious targets set out for our business. But as I said before, we believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through making it easier for travelers to find and book sustainable options. We're addressing this opportunity through our work with our travel sustainable bag program which now includes over 400,000 properties that can highlight their sustainable practices to customers on Booking.com and that program has been expanded to Priceline, Agoda and KAYAK. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the continued strength of travel demand we are seeing so far this year as well as our team's execution against our key strategic priorities. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers, both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. Well, Justin, why don't I take the second and then I'll let David talk specifically about ROIs and marketing and thoughts on that going forward. So I think we've been fairly clear in the past about how we view the company and how we believe our free cash flow should be used. And the first thing we always want to see is how can we invest that money appropriately in the company, build out services in ways that we can make the way we work with our partners and our traveller customers in a better way to help build this franchise. That's the first thing absolutely important. And after that, we say, well, we can't build it organically. Is there something outside the company, we think that could add value make things better for both, again, our traveller customers and our partner customers. And the last thing is, okay, if we don't see a good use of that, then we should be somehow returning that capital to our shareholders which is what we laid out the last quarter, we laid out our buyback program, where we had $4 million left in the previous authorization, $20 billion in the next one, that made $24 billion total. And then we said that over the next 4 years, we expect to be able to complete the full authorization. And I believe we've given out some numbers about our buyback now. And I am thrilled with the way we're doing this. But for long term, 5 years, this is what we laid out. Things can always change but that's the way we've laid it out. And I'll leave it up to David, in terms of ROIs, anything you're seeing differently about the summer, I have myself, maybe you see something. Mark, sorry about that. Let me take that part 2 ways because I know last time, I believe you asked about China outbound then too, if I recall correctly. And so China is not a significant part at all of our very strong Asia growth in the first quarter. And I want to make it clear that China is still not anywhere near it was in 2019 and outbound. It is coming back in terms of overall market coming back but there's still shortages of lift there. It is getting better than it was in January when there was a think mid-teens number of available airlift out of China outbound is coming back. I'll be probably honest with you, we are seeing more growth, obviously, in other parts of Asia. We're very pleased with the very strong growth we're seeing. I don't believe that we're going to break down individual countries but I do see that this is an area of growth for us that I'm very pleased about. Let me take the second one because I do look at that very carefully to see are there any smoke signals coming out of the market, giving us any indication of any changes. And I have not seen any decline in the star ratings that people are going for nor are we seeing a decrease in the length of stays, either one of which could increase that potential softening in the market and we have not seen that yet. And I think we made the remark about the booking window has gone out further indicating confidence, I believe, that's one hypothesis I want to point out, confidence about the future willing to put your money down and be willing to book for further out. That can be seen upon [indiscernible] is that people are concerned there's not going to be enough availability or they could be considered that prices are going to continue to rise, they will lock it in now, that's another way to look at too but none of those hypotheses to say anything about a weakness at all. And in terms of I think your first question, I'll leave it to David. So we don't break down the direct mix by region at all. But I can repeat things I've said in the past about how important direct mix is to the long-term increase the value of the franchise because of things we talk about with our connected trip. They're getting people in through the app primarily, having them understand all the different things we'll be able to offer to them, give them a real personalized thing that will make them want to always come back to us. The more we learn about them, the more they come back to us. So it's a flywheel effect happening there. Again, I won't break it down by region but my goal is to have every region have as many people as possible using the app and coming directly. That's the first thing. In terms of how we varied against our forecast, I don't know how much. David, why don't you get into that? Thanks, Doug and very interesting questions about that and I'll break it out into -- you start off with AI, then we went to a specific subset of degenerative AI. Let's just talk in general about AI first and how important this is into our business for many, many, many years, more than a decade perhaps, a machine learning model that really helped us do a better job making sure that what we're presenting to consumer, for example, is really something that they have a higher percentage chance they're going to convert on that. All sorts of ways that we use, very sophisticated machine learning models in many parts of the business that have helped us get us where we are today. Then of course, we come out in the fold, something that is -- the somewhat a lot of people were not that aware of this generative AI, large language models and see what could be done with them. And clearly, anytime there's a major shift in technology, everyone thinks like, well, is this going to be disruptive to the players who are already doing well? Is it not? And I said in my prepared remarks, how I feel very confident of where we are in this because of the work we've done in AI in the past, the number of people we've had working on, the amount of capital we have, our collaborations with universities. I believe that we are going to be benefiting greatly from this new type of technology in many different areas and some we haven't any thought of them yet and some things are going to be easy, perhaps increasing the productivity of our developers which we believe is hopefully going to achieve some very good results in the hopefully not so distant future, to things that perhaps are further away but ways that people interact with us in that connected trip vision, a way that you really do are able to recreate that human travel agent into something that's actually an automated player but is that does so much better than the human being did in the past? Now in terms of your very important question about the data and how do we protect it and not litigate it out and be used by others, that is a very important thing. And everyone from our attorneys to people in our development departments, people who are really working with some of these large language model foundational model people, we are looking very closely. Have they already been using our data and should they be -- and I think there's going to be a lot of interesting regulations in this area that nobody knows the answer yet, too but how will people become and say -- if they're data has been used in the past for training purposes or not. And I think it's a very open question that nobody knows the answer to yet but we will be very interested in the results. And I would just add, my conversations with our partner, some of our biggest partners and with their senior management, the critical thing for me is, are we providing them with what they need? Are we providing incremental business to them that helps them do better in their business? And do you feel that we are valuable to what you need. And I only heard positive things from all the people that I speak to in regards to where we are today versus where we were in the past. And it's a much more complementary relationship and I believe that will help us in the future to continue to build on that. So why don't I start Lee -- going to start with -- as you put it up VR, vacation rental -- I'd like to use alternative accommodation. Neither one is a great customer-friendly term, of course. Let me talk about that and then I'll let David talk about the direct business of what that may or may not indicate when you go into the share in terms of margins down the road. And I talked a little bit about in my prepared remarks about some of the things we are doing in terms of the alternative accommodations area in the U.S. to build that business and you were very polite to say that maybe -- that we may under index where we said, it's very nice to say because I continue to admit that in the past, we have not been hitting that as well as we showed that we were behind where I thought we should be, especially since we do fairly well in that in other parts world, particularly in Europe. Things that we've been doing are things that I talk about, first of all, is you got to make sure you're providing a good service to the people who own the home, who own the apartments. Are we doing things like liability insurance. Well, now we have something like that. Damage waiver type stuff. So we have that. Yes, we do. Last time I talked about how we were testing out an ability to request to book because some people or properties, they don't want to have automatic booking. They want to have a request to book system, so we are developing out back. Once you start getting that in, you had start saying, well, are people aware of your product? Because as I said, there wasn't a lot of -- people didn't have a lot of knowledge that we had such a product. And I was just to joke that if you went down in New York City and you said something on the street and said, I need a place in the Hamptons, where shall I go, I could almost guarantee you they weren't going to say Booking.com. Well, we need to get that supplies once we have it, then we got to make people aware that we have the supplies. We have to build all that. So there's nothing miracle about this. This is [indiscernible] tackling business 101. Get your supply out there, make it attractive and then make sure people know about it and that's what we've been doing, cranking away at it. And I'm pleased and I said it's really nice to see us starting to hit it. It can come up with their mix in the U.S. at all-time high in terms of alternative accommodation in part of our total mix, along with having absolute number of alternative accommodation room night bookings. So I am pleased with the progress that we're making and I know that we had to continue that because I know customers like this product and this is an area where we have growth possibilities. And David, regarding direct only, do you want to? Yes. So I'll start off by saying that I'm very pleased with how the strategy has been working out in the U.S. given our gain in share. As David mentioned, we have a bigger business than we did in 2019. It's been growing nicely. I really do think that it's achieving what we've been trying to accomplish which is to not be the under-indexed player than we were in the past and we're making good progress there. In terms of the absolute ROIs on these things, we don't break them out by region at all. But I will say that, obviously, we are very conscious of spending money the right way to get the right return. And we are -- came out of the business. Previously, I was in China. I know how important is to make sure that you're getting your money's worth to where you're spending it and we are doing that. Now, I think it's just going forward strategy work and to see us continuing in the same thing. And in terms of Asia, it was not dissimilar that we want to make sure when people are going to start traveling, we don't want to wait until you're halfway down the track to get out of the gate. That would not be the best move. Get out in front, be there when the traveller wants to start traveling and providing them with what they want. And that we've been doing and we just talked a little bit about how we were very pleased with the first quarter for Asia growth. And I think, hopefully, it will continue the same way. David, you're the owner of the P&L there, looking that you want to take on the cost. And regarding buybacks, I think we laid it out a little bit. You know what our plan is. You know what we're doing. And I'm not sure there's any more color I can give and we're pleased with where we are. Sure, Josh. Payments is an important part of the business. I've talked in the past about how it's the glue that brings everything together, along with making it easier for both the customer traveller and for the partner. And I think the growth in the amount of our business going through payments is a good indicator that is working and being accepted well. Customers have choice, both the traveller and the partner. Both of them can choose to use the payments or not. The fact that it's going up to me would be proof positive that people are finding it useful. And I believe in the long run, it's very -- being very, very helpful as we continue to build out the connected trip further. Richard, look, there's no doubt that hotels, when they are doing well may see less of a need to use all other ways to distribute and get business, then just have to come to them direct, right? And one of the things they're always looking at is what's the return. So with us in Genius, it's really being very targeted with them to make sure they understand how we can get the incremental demand that they wouldn't necessarily be able to get otherwise and then working with them and make sure is this value for them or not. And something I actually talked a bit in the past, I'm not sure on a call but our sales people have worked with hoteliers and talk to them sometimes, well, we're working with Genius program -- the Genius program in or that it's not actually the best use of their money in the best way for the business and told them, look, don't think you should use Genius this way, this amount, this time, whatever other time, etcetera. This is an idea long term, having a good partnership. It's just -- it's not just knocking down the door of hotel, give us discuss, give us discount. That's not how this works. This works with science. This starts with data. This is the machine learning stuff I talked about in the past. This is getting together to come up with a way that we can come up with a better way to improve their business. Now no doubt, as travel improves and such, there's going to be less of a need as the hotels will find other ways and perhaps less expensive ways or more efficient ways for them. And so maybe there will be some place but I am not at all concerned if your point is that this is going to make a drastic difference to how we do our business in the future. I don't see it. I see this as something that's going up more and more central as we continue to develop more ways to provide value to the traveller customer and be able to work with the customer supplier partner in ways that are complementary, symbiotic for all of us that we all win in this, the traveller wins, the hotel winds and we win. Richard, you're confusing me on this one. Thank you. So as always, I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our shareholders. We appreciate your support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you, everyone and good night."

Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergenn. I am pleased to report an improvement in topline trends in the third quarter, particularly in Europe that resulted in room nights, gross bookings and revenue all exceeding the high-end of our prior expectations. The revenue outperformance combined with disciplined marketing spend and lower-than-expected fixed OpEx growth helped drive adjusted EBITDA that was 9% above the high-end of our prior guidance range. We continue to be encouraged by the strength of our underlying business, the health of the travel industry and the attractiveness of our products. In the third quarter, our travelers booked just under 300 million room nights across our platforms, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Revenue of $8 billion grew 9% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion increased 12% year-over-year. Finally, adjusted earnings per share grew 16% year-over-year, helped by our strong capital return program, which reduced our average share count by 6% year-over-year. From a regional perspective, we observed an improvement in our room night growth in Europe in the third quarter, which was the primary driver of the sequential increase in our global room night growth. In Asia, we continue to perform well with another quarter of double-digit growth and we remain optimistic in our outlook for this region, which I'll discuss in more detail later on the call. In the U.S., we see relatively stable levels of growth in our business so far this year, which we think continues to outpace the broader U.S. accommodation industry. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to see healthy levels of room night growth as demand for travel remains resilient. Ewout will provide further details on our third quarter results and our thoughts about the fourth quarter. I remain confident in the attractive growth profile of the travel industry, our competitive position and our long-term growth and earnings model. We continue to see progress across several important initiatives, which include growing alternative accommodations, advancing our connected trip vision, continuing to develop our AI capabilities and continuing our progress in Asia. These initiatives contribute to our ongoing effort to deliver a better planning, booking and travel experience for our travelers, while also benefiting our supplier partners. We remain focused on being a trusted and valuable partner to all of the accommodation properties on our platforms by delivering incremental travel demand and developing products and features to help support these businesses, the majority of which are small independents. For alternative combination of booking.com, we continue to see more properties connect to our platform with listings at the end of Q3 reaching $7.9 million, up about 10% from last year. The growing number of listings provide more combination choices for our travelers, which we believe contributed to strong alternative accommodations room night growth of 14% in Q3. We believe that we have a differentiated offering, because we make all property types, hotels and alternative accommodations available on our booking.com platform. We see benefits to this approach. For example, our data shows that a portion of our bookers landing on our platform with an interest in a hotel will instead end up booking an alternative accommodation and vice-versa. We believe that this shows, in many cases, travelers are open to comparing hotel and alternative accommodation options when determining the best place to stay for their trip. Our objective is to make sure we continue to provide great choices for our travelers across all property types. On the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make the planning, booking and travel experience easier, more personal and more enjoyable while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. We believe the connected trip is strengthened by our growing merchant capabilities, which help bring the different elements of travel together in a more seamless booking experience. In addition, our Genius loyalty program at booking.com has been expanding outside of accommodations and into our other travel verticals, which helps to deliver more value to our travelers as they book more components of their trips with us and to our partners as they receive incremental bookings. We continue to see growth in Connected Trip transactions, which means a trip that includes booking more than one travel vertical. These connected transactions increased by over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter and represented a high single-digit percentage of booking.com's total transactions. We believe by making it easier to plan and book multiple elements of a trip on our platform, we are providing a better overall booking experience for our travelers and we have seen in past experiments that customers who choose to book a connected trip book more frequently with us and have a higher likelihood of booking directly with us in the future. Turning to flights. They're an important component for many of the connected trips that our travelers are booking. In the third quarter, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 39% year-over-year, which was an acceleration from Q2 growth of 28% and was driven primarily by the growth of booking.com flight offering, but we also benefited from strong growth in our flight business. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers coming to booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the number of these customers and returning customers that also see the value of the other services we offer on our platform. To achieve the easier and more personalized experience of the Connected Trip, we've always intended for AI technology to be at the center of this vision. At each of our brands, our teams of AI experts continue to draw on their valuable experience as they incorporate AI technology into our platforms. We believe that our proprietary data, along with our resources and scale, position us well to build compelling and personalized AI-powered offerings for our travelers and partners. This technology will also enable us to drive further efficiency in our own operations. We have significant activity in this area across the company, and I'll briefly discuss just a few of the encouraging efforts that are underway across our brands. Last summer, Booking.com launched its AI trip planner. And since the launch, Booking.com has gained valuable insights from its millions of interactions with bookers, as well as from the use of the Gen AI technology alongside our existing machine-learning models. The learnings from the AI trip planner are leading to new applications of Gen AI technology, including a recent launch of our smart filter, which makes over 200 potential search filters findable through a free text interface. These innovations also extend to the partner-facing side of the business at Booking.com. Gen AI is being leveraged to help properties write responses to traveler queries, and this tool has led to an increase in response rates to traveler messengers. This improves the experience for our travelers and partners. Booking.com is also testing a Gen AI-powered partner Chatbot to help with questions during the onboarding process and accelerate sign-ups, starting with a focus on alternative accommodation properties. Booking.com is also working to incorporate Gen AI into its customer service function to drive increased efficiency and a better experience for travelers. Initial testing shows meaningful improvements in topic detection in Booking.com's customer help center as well as customer service agent case summarization. Booking.com is still early in this journey and sees meaningful opportunities in improving customer service and driving greater efficiency by leveraging AI in the future. At Priceline, travelers have now had over 3 million interactions with its generative AI travel assistant called Penny. This was launched last summer. While Penny was originally positioned at the end of the funnel on the checkout page, it's now available across the full booking experience and can address many types of traveler questions, including destination discovery, hotel search and trip support. In October, Priceline launched Penny Voice, which enables Penny to engage in verbal conversations with travelers and to assist them with planning trips, searching for hotels and servicing bookings. As Priceline continues to enhance this offering, we envision that Penny will be able to anticipate needs based on preferences and past interaction, and then respond in a real-time voice. While there has been great progress in the development of Penny over the last year, Priceline is focused on further enhancing Penny over time by leveraging their valuable learnings so far. In Agoda, over 120 use cases for GenAI have been implemented across customer service, software development, content generation, product, finance and HR. Agoda is highly focused on leveraging Gen AI to automate product development using both externally and internally developed tools. This is leading to an increase in the share of code written by AI as well as measurable improvements in productivity per developer and development time. In March, Kayak launched its Ask Kayak travel Planning tool, which improves and personalizes the search experience by allowing travelers to use free-form text entries to search and refine the results. At the same time, Kayak, also launched PriceCheck, a price comparison tool that allows travelers to upload a screenshot of a flight intinerary, which Kayak can then check against many different sites in order to determine if there is a better price available for the traveler. At OpenTable, an AI voice bot has been recently integrated into its offering to help participating restaurants answer their phones. Diners can call these restaurants and perform tasks like making a reservation, altering their reservation, asking questions and noting dietary restrictions, which are then automatically updated into OpenTable software. OpenTable has also partnered with Salesforce Agent Force platform. This helps its customer service agents better serve its restaurants and diners. This platform is now handling restaurant web queries, which is helping agents focus on delivering great service in more complex situations. It's exciting to see the work happening across our company to integrate Gen AI into our platforms and the knowledge hearing that is ongoing between all of our brands. We know we are still in the very early days of Gen AI and we have much more to learn about consumers, how they ultimately want to interact with this new technology, but I remain confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI development and to improve our products for our customers given our many years of experience in AI, our travel-related data, connections to our supply partners and our human and financial capital. Over time, as we further incorporate this technology, we expect to see benefits in traveler and partner acquisition, retention and satisfaction. In addition, we expect it to improve operational efficiency, which will contribute to a deceleration of our fixed expense growth in the future. Finally, as I mentioned at the start of the call, we continue to be optimistic about our long-term outlook for Asia. We see Asia as strategically important due to its size, growth potential and our positioning in the region. We estimate that the travel industry growth in Asia will be in the high single-digits over the next five years, which is the highest market growth rate of our major regions. Our ambition is to continue to grow faster than the overall travel industry in Asia as we have done through the pandemic recovery. Over the last 12 months, about 24% of our global room nights were booked by bookers in the Asia region, which is a slightly higher mix than it was prior to the pandemic. Our business in Asia is diversified across the countries in the region with no single country representing more than a low single-digit percentage of our global room nights. The success we have seen in Asia and our solid positioning in the region has been driven by operating two complementary brands, Agoda and Booking.com. Our approach is to utilize both of these brands across the region with an eye on profitable growth for Booking Holdings over the long run. In conclusion, I'm encouraged by our strong third quarter results and the continued resilience of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well for the long term. We remain confident in the long-term growth of travel and in the many opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will now review our results for the third quarter and provide our thoughts for the fourth quarter and the full year. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will be posting a summary earnings presentation as well as our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. Now let's move to our third quarter results. Our room nights in the third quarter grew 8%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 3 percentage points. The stronger-than-expected room night growth was driven by an improvement in trends in Europe starting in August and benefited from the booking window expanding year-over-year in the third quarter versus our expectation for it to be more similar to 2023. Looking at our room night growth by region in the third quarter, Europe was up high single-digits, Asia was up low double-digits, rest of higher world was up mid-single-digits and the US was up low-single digits. As Glenn noted, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities, including growing alternative accommodations, increasing the mix of our bookings to the direct channel and our mobile apps, enhancing our Genius offering and driving growth in our other travel verticals as part of our Connected Trip fishing. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our third quarter room night growth was 14%, which continued to outpace the overall business. The global mix of alternative accommodation room nights at Booking.com was 35%, which was up 2 percentage points from the third quarter of 2023. We continue to strengthen our direct relationships with our travelers and increase loyalty on our platforms. Over the last four quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid 50 % range. And when we exclude our B2B business was in the low 60% range. We've seen both of these mixes continue to increase year-over-year. Mobile app mix of our total third quarter room nights was in the mid 50% range, which was up from the low 50% range in 2023. We continue to see that a significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel. For our Genius loyalty program, the mix of Booking.com room nights booked by travelers in the higher genius stairs of levels two and three was in the mid-50% range over the last four quarters and this mix continued to increase year-over-year. In our other travel verticals, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the third quarter increased 39%, driven by the continued growth of flight offerings by Booking.com and Agoda. We also saw rental car days booked on our platforms increased 16% in the third quarter, driven by strong growth at Booking.com. The growth rates for airline tickets and rental car days were both better than our expectation and both accelerated from the second quarter. Third quarter gross bookings increased 9%, which was approximately one percentage point higher than the 8% room night growth due to about two percentage points from higher flight bookings growth, partially offset by a decrease in constant currency accommodation ADRs of less than 1%. The year-over-year ADR decline was negatively impacted by a higher mix of the room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up less than 1% versus 2023. The increase in gross bookings exceeded the high end of our guidance by five percentage points due to stronger room night growth plus less pressure from changes in FX and stronger flight ticket growth. Third quarter revenue of $8 billion grew 9% year-over-year, which also exceeded the high-end of our guidance by five percentage points. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was in line with our expectations at 18.4% and was also in line with the prior year as increased revenues associated with payments were offset by a higher mix of flight bookings. The increased revenues from payments were driven by an increase in our merchant mix, which reached 65% of our total gross bookings, up from 56% in the third quarter of 2023. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 6% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 5.0%, about 15 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to a higher direct mix and higher-performance marketing ROIs, partially offset by increased spend in social media channels. Third quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 2.0% in line with last year. Our fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 7% year-over-year and were below our expectation due primarily to lower IT expenses, some of which we expect to shift into the fourth quarter, as well as lower G&A expenses. We continue to be very focused on carefully managing the growth of our fixed expenses. We believe it is important to drive greater operating leverage in our fixed expenses as this creates capacity for disciplined investment across our strategic initiatives, which we believe will help drive stronger top line and earnings growth in the future. Adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion grew 12% year-over-year and was above our expectation, largely driven by the higher revenue and also by the lower-than-expected fixed expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% in the third quarter was up versus last year by a bit more than one percentage point due to marketing and fixed expense leverage. Adjusted net income of over $2.8 billion was up 9%. Adjusted EPS of $83.89 per share was up 16% and benefited from a 6% lower average share count than the third quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was $2.5 billion in the third quarter and was negatively impacted by a $365 million accrual in G&A expenses related to a potential settlement of certain Italian indirect tax matters, partially offset by a $250 million reduction to our US repatriation tax liability, which lowered income tax expense. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our third quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.3 billion was down versus our second quarter ending balance of $16.8 billion due to about $2 billion of capital return, including share repurchases and dividends and a paydown of about $1.1 billion for debt that matured in September, partially offset by about $2.3 billion in free cash flow generated in the quarter. Moving to our thoughts for the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter, room night growth to be between 6% and 8%, continuing our positive trend from the third quarter. We expect fourth quarter gross bookings to grow between 7% and 9%, a point ahead of room night growth due to expected higher flight ticket growth. We expect constant currency accommodation ADRs to be approximately flat year-over-year. We expect fourth quarter revenue growth to be between 7% and 9%. We expect fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA to be between about $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, representing growth between 9% and 13%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow faster than revenue due primarily to marketing leverage as a result of increasing direct mix. We're increasing our outlook for the full-year, driven primarily by the stronger than expected third quarter, which is our seasonally largest revenue and profit quarter. We expect full-year gross bookings to increase about 8%, an improvement from our prior expectation of faster than 6%. We expect full-year revenue growth of just below 10%, which is better than our prior expectation of faster than 7%. We expect a slightly negative impact from changes in FX on our full-year top-line growth rates, which compares to our prior expectation for about one percentage point of negative impact. We expect fixed OpEx on an adjusted basis to grow around 10%, lower than our prior expectation. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow between 13% and 14%, which is better than our prior expectation due to the increased revenue growth and lower fixed OpEx growth. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit more than one percentage point. And finally, we expect our full-year adjusted EPS to grow in the high-teens. In conclusion, we are pleased with our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, and the full year. Thank you to all my colleagues across the company for their hard work, determination, innovation and teamwork. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question today from Justin Post, Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Thanks. I guess since you talked a lot about AI in your prepared remarks, maybe you could talk about how you expect that to translate to financials. Do you think AI can bring more direct traffic because of all your tools, better attach rates when people come to your site, maybe lower expenses? Just how we see that translate to financials. And then one on bookings. It looks like, you know, could you talk about some of the factors in Q4 that could affect bookings, either the hurricanes or the you know maybe the Middle East comps, how you're thinking about some of the 4Q factors? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Justin. It's Glenn speaking. I'll take the first question about AI and then I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about your question regarding fourth quarter. So we did give a number of examples about some of the things we're working on at the company on AI because I know there's a lot of curiosity about where are we, what's happening and it is one of the most exciting times I've -- this company ever. And it's something I've talked about before, maybe you've heard me talk in some conferences, et-cetera, that this type of technology is really transformational and it's going to make it so much better for all people in the travel industry, particularly for the traveler. It's also going to enable us to be able to provide a better service to our partners, enabling them to get more incremental, more targeted customers, help their business better. You, of course, you'd like to know how does that translate into dollars and cents. That is difficult at this time. It's still very, very early. We see some of the efficiencies already coming in some places. And we've mentioned and I mentioned in the prepared remarks about some of the numbers in terms of number of people using it, which is actually a relatively small number compared to the total number of interactions we have with customers. Sounds like a big number, 3 million, where that's a big number, but it's small compared to the size of this company. So I know what you'd like to know, but we're not going to project those kind of numbers right now. But what I will say is, it's incredibly important the companies that are successful in AI are going to be the long-term winners because it is going to, as I say, be transformational. I'm very pleased that we've made progress so far and we have some certain advantages. We've got capital. We've got people who have been working with AI now for many, many years. Sure, it wasn't Gen AI. They're working on machine learning model, et cetera, but we've got a lot of people who are very, very skilled in the areas of technology. In addition, having more data, which is so important to be able to combine with other people's large language models, other people's systems and come up with really unique ways to provide a better service. It's something that I'm just so thrilled to see what we're doing, what we're building. And I urge anybody who's curious about this, test out some of the things we have out there. It's out in the market. It's live, it's real. See what you think of it. I've done it a lot myself and sometimes I'm really pleased, sometimes a little disappointed, but I know we're making great progress. And in the future, we'll be able to better quantify for you what you'd like to know. Ewout I'll let you go into fourth quarter.\nEwout Steenbergen: Justin, with respect to the outlook for bookings in the fourth quarter, I think the headline is we're looking at the fourth quarter as a very robust and positive quarter where we see a continuation of the trends we have seen over the last few months. But let me dive a little bit deeper into that. First, the comps get a little easier in the fourth quarter because we are lapping the period last year where we had an impact, particularly with respect to the start of the conflict in the Middle East. The second point is, you are referring to events. Events from our perspective doesn't really impact our results. It might have a really short-term impact, but in the end, it always will average out. So you will never hear us really pointing to events as an impact on our outlook or actual performance. The third is what we have seen so far is continuation of the strength of August and September, also in October. The fourth is, I think it's important to take into consideration that we expect the booking window to be less expanded in the fourth quarter than we have seen in the third quarter. In other words, there might have been some pull forward of bookings that otherwise would have been in the fourth quarter into the third quarter. And the last is, we absolutely also have reflected uncertainties and risks with respect to the global geopolitical environment. We all know there are a lot of things out there that are happening and we also have taken that into consider -- in our consideration with respect to our fourth quarter outlook and guidance.\nJustin Post: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mark Mahaney, Evercore. Two questions, please.\nMark Mahaney: On the Asia callout, Glenn, was this the first time that Asia, I think as a percentage of your mix was higher than it was pre-COVID? I assume so. That's why you called it out, but anything in particular in the region that you've done? Or is that just the region you know finally recovering back to kind of full outbound travel mode? So you know how much of that sort of success for you was what you did versus just the market there finally recovering? And then AA in the mix, this I think 35% number. The question I have for you is trying to figure out where that mix is you know long term. In markets where you have kind of full sufficient inventory, both traditional and AA, is the usual mix in those markets around that average of 35% or is it materially higher? Therefore, we could expect the overall mix to go up because you still have a lot of regions where you don't have enough AA inventory? Thanks a lot.\nGlenn Fogel: Hi, Mark. I'm not sure if you're right actually on that thing about calling out Asia. I think we had some things where Asia has done better, but regardless of that, let's just talk a little bit about how pleased we are with the growth we're seeing in Asia. And yes, we're obviously getting a bit of a benefit because Asia overall as a market is growing fast. There were certain areas of Asia that were a little slower coming out of the pandemic and such. But this is an opportunity for me to really put out a thanks to our Agoda team. That team has been just doing really well in coming up with ways to provide a better service to the Asia customers. It's a little bit different in some parts. Now I say Asia, obviously, Asia is a very big place, a lot of different countries, a lot of different ways people buy what people are looking for. And the Agoda team has done a good job of localization of coming up with ways that the customer in different parts of Asia, the way they want to buy, matching up with different types of payment methods, for example, to be able to -- that the local person who wants to pay in a certain way can use our service and feel comfortable doing that. In addition, making sure we're getting great inventory. Again, can be a little different in Asia than other parts where there's a lot of small independence or different ways to get great pricing, make sure it's showing up on our site. So great team effort by everybody there in Agoda and that's helping great deal of booking, also doing Asia efforts. So overall, we're really, really pleased with what's happening there. Now your second question about alternative accommodations, we are pleased, again, with the growth rate there, 14%, like it, increasing the listings to 7.9 million, 10% increase in list like that one too. You know last time in the call, I said how we had beaten our biggest homes competitor 11 of the last 12 times and we came out of that time ahead of them in terms of the earnings announcement, I didn't know if we're going to beat them again and we did. So I'm wondering this time will we do it again, maybe at 13 quarters out of 14 and it's not a small business. It's a big business because as we mentioned a couple of times, the total amount of room nights for alternative accommodation is running roughly a little bit two-thirds of the biggest homes player in this market. So it's a big business. So it's great to be able to growing at this size and it's great to be doing in sort of the leading in terms of growth. Your question is, at what stage do we end up and feel sort of that sort of the max or so? I don't know because one of the key things to our business is making sure that we just get as much of the inventory that the customer wants on the site and they choose. And I mentioned it in the remarks about how customers come to our site and from what they've chosen to start with, we know what they were thinking of and then they go and they buy something else. So a key thing to our business is making sure we provide whatever the customer wants and not try and steer them. So I don't know what the ultimate share is going to be. I do know though what's important is to continue to work on getting great inventory. And as long as we're talking about it, we're nowhere near in certain regions sort of getting it. It's a lot of ramp left in front of us. US in particular, I keep repeating myself quarter-after-quarter. Sure, we're growing that business nicely in the U.S., but there's so much more to be done. And I was just looking today, literally today because seeing what was available for us in the Hamptons, I'm a New Yorker. I look into the summer, it's like not enough inventory there yet. So some people can say that's a negative. I say that's you know an opportunity for us and I'm really looking forward to continue to build out the business.\nMark Mahaney: Thank you, Glenn.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan. One moment\u2026\nDae Lee: First one --\nOperator: I apologize, just one moment. Okay, go ahead, Doug. I'm sorry.\nDae Lee: Okay. Hey, this is Dae on for Doug. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. So the first one, could you double-click on what you're seeing in Europe? Last quarter, you talked about mild moderation in growth in Europe, but the region drove outperformance this quarter. So what changed there into end of summer and fall? And do you have any macro views to share around the U.S. as a region?\nEwout Steenbergen: First, with respect to Europe, we have clearly seen first, with respect to Europe, we have clearly seen a reacceleration of growth starting in August. We believe that perhaps in July, there was a bit of impact of some of the events. But again, we always look at that as purely timing and that is averaging out. But then we also believe there is a general underlying improvement what we are seeing in Europe in terms of the general demand for our products and services. It's partially market, but it's partially also our proposition. Of course, as Glen already explained, having such a great platform with so many options, so many verticals where you can purchase in so many different ways. And in Europe, many people use us on the app and it's really very much a mainstream app that people are using if they want to travel very easy. You have your credit card there, easy to book, easy to adjust. So that is definitely in Europe, a big winner and therefore, we have been so much really the standard in Europe with respect to our proposition. I also need to point at the expansion of the booking window that happened in the third quarter. So that definitely also helped with the acceleration of growth at the same time.\nDae Lee: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Kevin Kopelman, TD Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks so much. I had a question on marketing. Could you give us an update on kind of you know what you're seeing? You mentioned higher ROIs in the third quarter. How much of that is underlying improvement in ROIs versus Europe being stronger? And can you update us on how you expect the full year now to look in terms of marketing and merchandising as a percentage of GBP? Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, Kevin. Overall, how you should look at marketing and higher ROIs I think this is really where the company has such a specialized expertise, has such great algorithms that are continuously optimizing our incremental spend to make sure that the incremental ROIs are really the highest that are possible and doing that across all the different options we have how to allocate our dollars. So this could be the different forms of performance marketing channels, it could be with respect to merchandising, but it could also be with the social media channels where we are expanding our marketing spend as well. So clearly, the opportunity was there through our continuous optimization to ultimately achieve higher growth with higher ROIs at the same time. With respect to your question on the outlook, merchandising as a percentage of growth bookings, we expect it to be more or less flat compared to last year for each of the quarters of 2024 and for the full year. With respect to marketing, we expect marketing leverage to continue in the fourth quarter as a result of the continued growth of our direct channels.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next up, we'll hear from Eric Sheridan, Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the question. I want to come back to the theme on fixed investments. You know, first, looking backwards, you know, maybe highlight some of where you've made investments around fixed costs and what you're most proud of in turning a return profile in those fixed investments that you're seeing an impact on the business today? And not about 2025, but just longer term, how do you think about coming out of that fixed investment cycle and how to think about the return profile or incremental margin that could be produced in the business as fixed investments start to grow slower than revenue over the longer term? Thank you.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, Eric, I really love that question because it's something I'm extremely personally passionate about. The way we look at this is actually in two different ways. One is where do we see opportunities for efficiencies and achieving operating leverage and then a completely separate decision mechanism around where can we reinvest those dollars in the most optimal way that we will achieve the highest growth potential at attractive business case returns in the future. So let me start with the first part. In terms of operating leverage, we believe there are many opportunities we have as a company because we have been building up skill in the organization and now, we should have an opportunity to run much more volume over the existing scale over the next period. So let me point you to a couple of areas. First, we have tremendously slowed down hiring. So if you look now, our year-over-year headcount is up approximately 3%. If you go back a year ago in the third quarter of 2023, headcount was up 13%. So clearly, we are being more efficient and we are very careful with hiring. We already touched on our AI, artificial intelligence as a clear opportunity to find efficiencies in the future across many different areas. In the interest of time, I will not elaborate on that, but that's a clear opportunity. We're also looking at procurement, real estate, operating model optimizations, looking at spends, layers to really make the organization more agile in many of those areas. And we believe we really have an opportunity to expand on that in the future, But then I think your question is also where are we proud about in terms of investments? Well, if you think about the number of new areas where we're growing as a company, it's super impressive from my perspective. A few years ago, we were not really in flags. Look at the growth we are reporting, 39%, look at all the other verticals. Looking at what we're doing with respect to payments and fintech, looking at what we're doing from a geographical perspective. Glenn was touching on the very impressive growth in Asia, the investments we're making in the U.S. and we believe we are growing still faster than the market in the U.S. and we'll continue to aim to do that in the future as well and many other areas. So we are very much focused on in a very disciplined way, looking at our scarce resources, making sure that we're using that in the most optimal way and in the end, invest in the most attractive growth opportunities for the company over the next period.\nGlenn Fogel: And I'll just add, I think what Ewout said really hit a lot of the key things that have made us successful. And looking back, there have been a lot of times that people have questioned what are we investing in and why we're spending the money there, et cetera. And we're now finally beginning to see a little bit of the benefit to this. So there was a point where, as you know, Booking.com was totally an agency business, totally an agency business, no payments at all. Now we talk about our merchant mix is now 65% and we talk about how important it was to have that as a foundational pillar for our connected trip, which is another area where people question, why are you getting out of hotels? Why are you getting into these other verticals? The end of the day is long term success of a company is being able to make change, to make things different as the world changes, you have to change with it. If we just stayed as an agency-only hotel and not had invested in other areas, we will not be where we are today. Now going forward, we can't stop. We continue to do that. So as Ewout said, we've got to be very careful, where are we spending our money. We've got to not put money into things that are not going to be productive and move resources into place that is -- of something is no longer necessary, we just have to have the will to stop that and do something else. So I'm really proud that we've been able to -- I've been here now almost 25 years. It will be 25 years in February. And throughout this, we have changed tremendously, but the one thing that we really concentrate on is making sure we are careful with our shareholders' money.\nEric Sheridan : Thank you.\nOperator: And from Deutsche Bank, Lee Horowitz has the next question.\nLee Horowitz: Great, thanks. Maybe Glenn, another one on alternative accommodations. You gave a lot of color on the booking patterns you're seeing on the platform as it relates to cross-shopping hotels and alternative accommodations. But can you comment at all what you're seeing in terms of incrementality of this volume? Do you think your growing presence here is bringing in new cohorts of travelers who are coming to booking for this vertical specifically or is a large piece of this volume coming from consumers that would have likely booked a hotel on your platform otherwise?\nGlenn Fogel: That's a very interesting question because I haven't noticed any surveying or trying to understand. Obviously, we can see if we look at it, a customer has come who we've never seen before, we started with an alternative accommodation because they knew that we had alternate accommodations and that would be completely incremental because we have alternate location accommodations. I don't have the data on that, but I can say, I believe without actual data proof, I believe that we have brought in people who would not have come otherwise, would have gone to another site, but came to us because we did offer them an alternative accommodation. And I would say specifically in Europe, I'm almost certain of that because the awareness of our alternative accommodations business in Europe is very high unlike in other parts of the world. So when somebody thinks that I want to have a nice villa in Nice and France, they will think booking.com and that is the incrementality that you're asking about. But again, what's more important is to offering all aspects of travel that goes back to the whole connected trip vision because if somebody does get that nice villa, they have to get there somehow. So if they're going to fly, it's good to be able to combine that. And then they'll have to get from the airport to the villa. So it's nice to have the ground transportation, maybe they need insurance. And as I always say, nobody goes on a holiday, so they can sit in the room, whether it be a villa, even this really nice one or a hotel room, they want to do stuff and that's why attractions is important. I can go on and on and on. And tying that all together in that connected trip vision using science, using data, using our Gen AI capabilities to make sure we're offering the optimal things for that traveler in addition given the opportunities for our suppliers to offer up different types of service at different price points so that they too can enjoy the benefits of this connected vision in terms of more customers, more profitability. That's the thing we're building. That's the real true incrementality and that is getting people whoever they're traveling right now some other way that they come to us because we offer them a better service.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks. And then maybe just one follow-up on sort of fixed OpEx. So given a lot of conversation around your passion for driving fixed OpEx going forward. I guess, given where you guys are in your investment cycle, the -- your motivation to free up resources to invest in a lot of your growth drivers and a lot of the conversation on the potential for Gen AI to help the P&L? Do you think that, you know, the business is in a place where it can drive fixed OpEx leverage, not just next year, but for many years out into the future and it should be part of the way we think about you guys going forward?\nGlenn Fogel: I would say absolutely, Lee, there is a big opportunity to do that. But there's always the flip side of how much opportunity do we have to reinvest in the business. So again, coming to the two sides of the coin that I was talking about before, do we have opportunities to find more opportunities for operating leverage, not only in 2025, but also in 2026, absolutely. And of course, some of the initiatives that are being worked on or under development or have been recently implemented, the run rate effects, you will see that coming in then over time in the future. But as I said as well is, I think this company -- the uniqueness of this company is it's doing well, it's growing fast, it's delivering very strong results. We have a lot of free cash flow generation, but we also can reinvest in so many initiatives in order to grow even faster, grow even faster in all those different areas. So how that on a net basis will play out, that's a little bit hard to say. But on the growth basis, in the sense of how much can we really find in terms of efficiencies, I think there's still a long way to go.\nOperator: Next up, we'll take a question from Tom White, D.A. Davidson.\nTom White: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just one, if I could, on social. It seems like in recent months, you know, we've heard you guys mention having better success kind of accessing travel demand in social media channels, which I guess for a long time didn't really seem to be the case. There's obviously a ton of engagement there, but it didn't seem like it was necessarily efficient demand source for you. Can you maybe talk a bit about why that's changing or it seems to be changing? And curious like how big a vector of growth social maybe could be for you guys over the next several years? And how do you think about the incrementality, I guess, of that channel? Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: So, this is Glenn speaking, I'll let Ewout talk a little bit if he wants about anything that I don't mention. But we are pleased that we are seeing good results from putting money to work in social platforms. And as you know, over many years, we had mentioned that we were experimenting, but it wasn't really working for us yet. And now finally, we are beginning to see it work. That being said, it's a relatively small amount of money compared to our overall marketing expenses, but we're glad. And the thing is, it always comes out that we're agnostic. As long as we get the right ROI, that's what we really -- you, know our goal is, that's what we care about and it's working now more than in the past because I think cooperation with people in the social platform areas that we're working with people there and coming up with creative ways together to achieve our mutual goals. And we want to continue to do that and we'll continue to invest so long as we keep getting the ROIs that we want, that's as simple as it is. How big could it be? I don't know. It really will depend on how much further ahead we keep the ROIs. In the past, in the past, we had seen some interesting things that worked a little bit, but then when you try to scale it, the ROIs fell off. Now we're not really seeing that in the things we're trying now. But I can't promise that, you know, as we grow bigger and bigger, you start getting to large numbers, real large numbers like when our number -- our total amount we spend on marketing, who knows, but I am encouraged by the progress we have made so far and I am really glad to be able to diversify that pay performance type spend. And, Ewout, you want to say anything on it?\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, maybe two quick things to add. First, coming back to AI, actually, AI is an important tool to help with the additional advertisement effectiveness. So that the targeting is better and therefore, we can achieve those higher incremental ROIs. And maybe one other point with respect to the financials. Glenn is right, in absolute terms, the spend on the social media marketing channels is still relatively small. But I'm actually encouraged because if you look at the marketing increase spend year-over-year, actually meaningful part of the delta increase is actually going to those social channels.\nOperator: Next question is Jed Kelly, Oppenheimer.\nJed Kelly: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to the U.S., you're getting some nice branding here with the baseball playoffs having, you know, record ratings. You called out room nights maybe growing low-single-digits. So can you talk about where you think your brand is in the U.S.? And then just on the single units in the U.S., you know, talking to some property managers, they still think you're a little more complex to work with versus some of the other platforms. Can you talk about where you are in terms of maybe simplifying it for them? Thank you.\nGlenn Fogel: So you're right on your second point about it's not as easy yet as some of our competitors. I know that's true and that's one of the things we're working on. I'll be sure to say that's opportunity for us. That's great. We're doing so well right now and we still haven't perfected that. So that's all upside for us. In terms of awareness, we're still not where we'd like to be, but we continue to improve. I continue to see those numbers going up. When I look at the reports, marketing comes back -- market report comes back to me, reports our marketing department comes back to me. I am pleased with the progress we're making. But again, that's more opportunity for us. Ewout anything specific on that?\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, just a small technicality just to point out is it looks like where we said last quarter, we are growing in the U.S. mid-single digits and now it's low-single-digits. I would still characterize this more stable growth over these periods because we're really at the cusp in both quarters in terms of which of those buckets it's falling. So I wouldn't read too much in it as an investor, but overall, I would call this more stable growth over the last two quarters in the U.S.\nJed Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Naved Khan, B. Riley Securities.\nNaved Khan: Yes, hi. Thanks a lot. A couple of questions. Glenn, it's great to hear the updates on Gen AI. Maybe give us your thoughts on if you think Gen AI can drive more shift in bookings that can happen through online marketplaces like booking.com versus those that happen directly on a hotel website? And then with respect to Connected Trip, I remember you guys had a partnership with some super apps in Asia like Grab, which is a ride-hailing app. Any updates you can share on those partnerships would be great. Thanks.\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. So two separate questions. Let me talk first a little bit about AI in general and the ability for us versus others. This stuff is not easy. It's complicated. Gen AI is hard stuff and it's really good to be in a position where you have resources, people, capital, data to be able to drive forward experiments to see what works, what doesn't work, see how well, how quickly it works. And there's no doubt this is an advantage. So if you're a hotel, even an extremely large hotel, you don't have -- you do not have the resources that we have, I believe. Now, of course, you can partner with others. In fact, we're doing that ourselves. An example, we have, you know, go to OpenTable example, they're not building so much themself. They're partnering with us; they did a good agreement with Salesforce to work with their new AI service that's great there. But I believe it's really important to be able to combine your own data in the hotels accommodations area and come up with things that are truly differentiating and personalization. So I am confident that we have, I'd say, the pole position in the growth of this area, and I'm very excited about it. The other thing you mentioned about our partnerships in Asia with some other players, it's a very small amount of business. Look, we're pleased with where our relationships are with them, et cetera. But that is not something that is -- should be seen as anything that was influencing our Asia numbers at all.\nNaved Khan: Thank you, Glenn.\nOperator: We'll go next to John Colantuoni, Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. A quick one on booking window. Maybe you could just help us size the benefit to the third quarter in terms of room nights from both relative to your expectations and on a year-on-year growth rate perspective? And then second, on North America, your business there seems to be maybe the one region that's tracking more consistent with the broader market. Talk about what investments and capabilities you're making to start driving market-share gains once again in North America? Thanks.\nEwout Steenbergen: John, I will take the first question. We're not really breaking out how much the booking window had an impact on accelerated growth in the third quarter. It is a bit of benefit, but I wouldn't overestimate the impact period-over-period. So I would say slight benefit in the third quarter, but we're not really quantifying that. In terms of your second question, we are doing in North America relative to the market based on external data sources that we are looking at, we believe in the third quarter actually we were growing a bit faster than the market overall. And that's of course the result of a lot of investments we're making. Glenn has touched on many of those already, the number of listings, the focus on alternative accommodations, the investments in the brand we're making. For example, with respect to the World Series and the baseball playoffs in general, what we're doing in terms of becoming more -- creating more familiarity with the brand in the U.S. and many other features and product enhancements we're making to really further improve our market position in the U.S. We're a challenger in this market and actually we think that's a good position to be in because it is an opportunity to grow and ultimately be able to get to our natural position in terms of overall market impact in the U.S.\nJohn Colantuoni: Thanks so much.\nOperator: And Everyone, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the call back to Mr. Glenn Fogel for any additional or closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our stockholders. We greatly appreciate everyone's support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you and good night.\nOperator: Once again, everyone, that does conclude our conference for today. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will now review our results for the third quarter and provide our thoughts for the fourth quarter and the full year. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will be posting a summary earnings presentation as well as our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. Now let's move to our third quarter results. Our room nights in the third quarter grew 8%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 3 percentage points. The stronger-than-expected room night growth was driven by an improvement in trends in Europe starting in August and benefited from the booking window expanding year-over-year in the third quarter versus our expectation for it to be more similar to 2023. Looking at our room night growth by region in the third quarter, Europe was up high single-digits, Asia was up low double-digits, rest of higher world was up mid-single-digits and the US was up low-single digits. As Glenn noted, we continue to make progress against our strategic priorities, including growing alternative accommodations, increasing the mix of our bookings to the direct channel and our mobile apps, enhancing our Genius offering and driving growth in our other travel verticals as part of our Connected Trip fishing. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our third quarter room night growth was 14%, which continued to outpace the overall business. The global mix of alternative accommodation room nights at Booking.com was 35%, which was up 2 percentage points from the third quarter of 2023. We continue to strengthen our direct relationships with our travelers and increase loyalty on our platforms. Over the last four quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid 50 % range. And when we exclude our B2B business was in the low 60% range. We've seen both of these mixes continue to increase year-over-year. Mobile app mix of our total third quarter room nights was in the mid 50% range, which was up from the low 50% range in 2023. We continue to see that a significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel. For our Genius loyalty program, the mix of Booking.com room nights booked by travelers in the higher genius stairs of levels two and three was in the mid-50% range over the last four quarters and this mix continued to increase year-over-year. In our other travel verticals, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the third quarter increased 39%, driven by the continued growth of flight offerings by Booking.com and Agoda. We also saw rental car days booked on our platforms increased 16% in the third quarter, driven by strong growth at Booking.com. The growth rates for airline tickets and rental car days were both better than our expectation and both accelerated from the second quarter. Third quarter gross bookings increased 9%, which was approximately one percentage point higher than the 8% room night growth due to about two percentage points from higher flight bookings growth, partially offset by a decrease in constant currency accommodation ADRs of less than 1%. The year-over-year ADR decline was negatively impacted by a higher mix of the room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up less than 1% versus 2023. The increase in gross bookings exceeded the high end of our guidance by five percentage points due to stronger room night growth plus less pressure from changes in FX and stronger flight ticket growth. Third quarter revenue of $8 billion grew 9% year-over-year, which also exceeded the high-end of our guidance by five percentage points. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was in line with our expectations at 18.4% and was also in line with the prior year as increased revenues associated with payments were offset by a higher mix of flight bookings. The increased revenues from payments were driven by an increase in our merchant mix, which reached 65% of our total gross bookings, up from 56% in the third quarter of 2023. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 6% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 5.0%, about 15 basis points lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to a higher direct mix and higher-performance marketing ROIs, partially offset by increased spend in social media channels. Third quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 2.0% in line with last year. Our fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 7% year-over-year and were below our expectation due primarily to lower IT expenses, some of which we expect to shift into the fourth quarter, as well as lower G&A expenses. We continue to be very focused on carefully managing the growth of our fixed expenses. We believe it is important to drive greater operating leverage in our fixed expenses as this creates capacity for disciplined investment across our strategic initiatives, which we believe will help drive stronger top line and earnings growth in the future. Adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion grew 12% year-over-year and was above our expectation, largely driven by the higher revenue and also by the lower-than-expected fixed expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 45.8% in the third quarter was up versus last year by a bit more than one percentage point due to marketing and fixed expense leverage. Adjusted net income of over $2.8 billion was up 9%. Adjusted EPS of $83.89 per share was up 16% and benefited from a 6% lower average share count than the third quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was $2.5 billion in the third quarter and was negatively impacted by a $365 million accrual in G&A expenses related to a potential settlement of certain Italian indirect tax matters, partially offset by a $250 million reduction to our US repatriation tax liability, which lowered income tax expense. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our third quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.3 billion was down versus our second quarter ending balance of $16.8 billion due to about $2 billion of capital return, including share repurchases and dividends and a paydown of about $1.1 billion for debt that matured in September, partially offset by about $2.3 billion in free cash flow generated in the quarter. Moving to our thoughts for the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter, room night growth to be between 6% and 8%, continuing our positive trend from the third quarter. We expect fourth quarter gross bookings to grow between 7% and 9%, a point ahead of room night growth due to expected higher flight ticket growth. We expect constant currency accommodation ADRs to be approximately flat year-over-year. We expect fourth quarter revenue growth to be between 7% and 9%. We expect fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA to be between about $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, representing growth between 9% and 13%. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow faster than revenue due primarily to marketing leverage as a result of increasing direct mix. We're increasing our outlook for the full-year, driven primarily by the stronger than expected third quarter, which is our seasonally largest revenue and profit quarter. We expect full-year gross bookings to increase about 8%, an improvement from our prior expectation of faster than 6%. We expect full-year revenue growth of just below 10%, which is better than our prior expectation of faster than 7%. We expect a slightly negative impact from changes in FX on our full-year top-line growth rates, which compares to our prior expectation for about one percentage point of negative impact. We expect fixed OpEx on an adjusted basis to grow around 10%, lower than our prior expectation. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow between 13% and 14%, which is better than our prior expectation due to the increased revenue growth and lower fixed OpEx growth. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit more than one percentage point. And finally, we expect our full-year adjusted EPS to grow in the high-teens. In conclusion, we are pleased with our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, and the full year. Thank you to all my colleagues across the company for their hard work, determination, innovation and teamwork. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines? Justin, with respect to the outlook for bookings in the fourth quarter, I think the headline is we're looking at the fourth quarter as a very robust and positive quarter where we see a continuation of the trends we have seen over the last few months. But let me dive a little bit deeper into that. First, the comps get a little easier in the fourth quarter because we are lapping the period last year where we had an impact, particularly with respect to the start of the conflict in the Middle East. The second point is, you are referring to events. Events from our perspective doesn't really impact our results. It might have a really short-term impact, but in the end, it always will average out. So you will never hear us really pointing to events as an impact on our outlook or actual performance. The third is what we have seen so far is continuation of the strength of August and September, also in October. The fourth is, I think it's important to take into consideration that we expect the booking window to be less expanded in the fourth quarter than we have seen in the third quarter. In other words, there might have been some pull forward of bookings that otherwise would have been in the fourth quarter into the third quarter. And the last is, we absolutely also have reflected uncertainties and risks with respect to the global geopolitical environment. We all know there are a lot of things out there that are happening and we also have taken that into consider -- in our consideration with respect to our fourth quarter outlook and guidance. First, with respect to Europe, we have clearly seen first, with respect to Europe, we have clearly seen a reacceleration of growth starting in August. We believe that perhaps in July, there was a bit of impact of some of the events. But again, we always look at that as purely timing and that is averaging out. But then we also believe there is a general underlying improvement what we are seeing in Europe in terms of the general demand for our products and services. It's partially market, but it's partially also our proposition. Of course, as Glen already explained, having such a great platform with so many options, so many verticals where you can purchase in so many different ways. And in Europe, many people use us on the app and it's really very much a mainstream app that people are using if they want to travel very easy. You have your credit card there, easy to book, easy to adjust. So that is definitely in Europe, a big winner and therefore, we have been so much really the standard in Europe with respect to our proposition. I also need to point at the expansion of the booking window that happened in the third quarter. So that definitely also helped with the acceleration of growth at the same time. Yes, Kevin. Overall, how you should look at marketing and higher ROIs I think this is really where the company has such a specialized expertise, has such great algorithms that are continuously optimizing our incremental spend to make sure that the incremental ROIs are really the highest that are possible and doing that across all the different options we have how to allocate our dollars. So this could be the different forms of performance marketing channels, it could be with respect to merchandising, but it could also be with the social media channels where we are expanding our marketing spend as well. So clearly, the opportunity was there through our continuous optimization to ultimately achieve higher growth with higher ROIs at the same time. With respect to your question on the outlook, merchandising as a percentage of growth bookings, we expect it to be more or less flat compared to last year for each of the quarters of 2024 and for the full year. With respect to marketing, we expect marketing leverage to continue in the fourth quarter as a result of the continued growth of our direct channels. Yes, Eric, I really love that question because it's something I'm extremely personally passionate about. The way we look at this is actually in two different ways. One is where do we see opportunities for efficiencies and achieving operating leverage and then a completely separate decision mechanism around where can we reinvest those dollars in the most optimal way that we will achieve the highest growth potential at attractive business case returns in the future. So let me start with the first part. In terms of operating leverage, we believe there are many opportunities we have as a company because we have been building up skill in the organization and now, we should have an opportunity to run much more volume over the existing scale over the next period. So let me point you to a couple of areas. First, we have tremendously slowed down hiring. So if you look now, our year-over-year headcount is up approximately 3%. If you go back a year ago in the third quarter of 2023, headcount was up 13%. So clearly, we are being more efficient and we are very careful with hiring. We already touched on our AI, artificial intelligence as a clear opportunity to find efficiencies in the future across many different areas. In the interest of time, I will not elaborate on that, but that's a clear opportunity. We're also looking at procurement, real estate, operating model optimizations, looking at spends, layers to really make the organization more agile in many of those areas. And we believe we really have an opportunity to expand on that in the future, But then I think your question is also where are we proud about in terms of investments? Well, if you think about the number of new areas where we're growing as a company, it's super impressive from my perspective. A few years ago, we were not really in flags. Look at the growth we are reporting, 39%, look at all the other verticals. Looking at what we're doing with respect to payments and fintech, looking at what we're doing from a geographical perspective. Glenn was touching on the very impressive growth in Asia, the investments we're making in the U.S. and we believe we are growing still faster than the market in the U.S. and we'll continue to aim to do that in the future as well and many other areas. So we are very much focused on in a very disciplined way, looking at our scarce resources, making sure that we're using that in the most optimal way and in the end, invest in the most attractive growth opportunities for the company over the next period. Yes, maybe two quick things to add. First, coming back to AI, actually, AI is an important tool to help with the additional advertisement effectiveness. So that the targeting is better and therefore, we can achieve those higher incremental ROIs. And maybe one other point with respect to the financials. Glenn is right, in absolute terms, the spend on the social media marketing channels is still relatively small. But I'm actually encouraged because if you look at the marketing increase spend year-over-year, actually meaningful part of the delta increase is actually going to those social channels. Yes, just a small technicality just to point out is it looks like where we said last quarter, we are growing in the U.S. mid-single digits and now it's low-single-digits. I would still characterize this more stable growth over these periods because we're really at the cusp in both quarters in terms of which of those buckets it's falling. So I wouldn't read too much in it as an investor, but overall, I would call this more stable growth over the last two quarters in the U.S. John, I will take the first question. We're not really breaking out how much the booking window had an impact on accelerated growth in the third quarter. It is a bit of benefit, but I wouldn't overestimate the impact period-over-period. So I would say slight benefit in the third quarter, but we're not really quantifying that. In terms of your second question, we are doing in North America relative to the market based on external data sources that we are looking at, we believe in the third quarter actually we were growing a bit faster than the market overall. And that's of course the result of a lot of investments we're making.

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergenn. I am pleased to report an improvement in topline trends in the third quarter, particularly in Europe that resulted in room nights, gross bookings and revenue all exceeding the high-end of our prior expectations. The revenue outperformance combined with disciplined marketing spend and lower-than-expected fixed OpEx growth helped drive adjusted EBITDA that was 9% above the high-end of our prior guidance range. We continue to be encouraged by the strength of our underlying business, the health of the travel industry and the attractiveness of our products. In the third quarter, our travelers booked just under 300 million room nights across our platforms, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Revenue of $8 billion grew 9% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA of $3.7 billion increased 12% year-over-year. Finally, adjusted earnings per share grew 16% year-over-year, helped by our strong capital return program, which reduced our average share count by 6% year-over-year. From a regional perspective, we observed an improvement in our room night growth in Europe in the third quarter, which was the primary driver of the sequential increase in our global room night growth. In Asia, we continue to perform well with another quarter of double-digit growth and we remain optimistic in our outlook for this region, which I'll discuss in more detail later on the call. In the U.S., we see relatively stable levels of growth in our business so far this year, which we think continues to outpace the broader U.S. accommodation industry. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue to see healthy levels of room night growth as demand for travel remains resilient. Ewout will provide further details on our third quarter results and our thoughts about the fourth quarter. I remain confident in the attractive growth profile of the travel industry, our competitive position and our long-term growth and earnings model. We continue to see progress across several important initiatives, which include growing alternative accommodations, advancing our connected trip vision, continuing to develop our AI capabilities and continuing our progress in Asia. These initiatives contribute to our ongoing effort to deliver a better planning, booking and travel experience for our travelers, while also benefiting our supplier partners. We remain focused on being a trusted and valuable partner to all of the accommodation properties on our platforms by delivering incremental travel demand and developing products and features to help support these businesses, the majority of which are small independents. For alternative combination of booking.com, we continue to see more properties connect to our platform with listings at the end of Q3 reaching $7.9 million, up about 10% from last year. The growing number of listings provide more combination choices for our travelers, which we believe contributed to strong alternative accommodations room night growth of 14% in Q3. We believe that we have a differentiated offering, because we make all property types, hotels and alternative accommodations available on our booking.com platform. We see benefits to this approach. For example, our data shows that a portion of our bookers landing on our platform with an interest in a hotel will instead end up booking an alternative accommodation and vice-versa. We believe that this shows, in many cases, travelers are open to comparing hotel and alternative accommodation options when determining the best place to stay for their trip. Our objective is to make sure we continue to provide great choices for our travelers across all property types. On the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make the planning, booking and travel experience easier, more personal and more enjoyable while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. We believe the connected trip is strengthened by our growing merchant capabilities, which help bring the different elements of travel together in a more seamless booking experience. In addition, our Genius loyalty program at booking.com has been expanding outside of accommodations and into our other travel verticals, which helps to deliver more value to our travelers as they book more components of their trips with us and to our partners as they receive incremental bookings. We continue to see growth in Connected Trip transactions, which means a trip that includes booking more than one travel vertical. These connected transactions increased by over 40% year-over-year in the third quarter and represented a high single-digit percentage of booking.com's total transactions. We believe by making it easier to plan and book multiple elements of a trip on our platform, we are providing a better overall booking experience for our travelers and we have seen in past experiments that customers who choose to book a connected trip book more frequently with us and have a higher likelihood of booking directly with us in the future. Turning to flights. They're an important component for many of the connected trips that our travelers are booking. In the third quarter, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 39% year-over-year, which was an acceleration from Q2 growth of 28% and was driven primarily by the growth of booking.com flight offering, but we also benefited from strong growth in our flight business. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers coming to booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the number of these customers and returning customers that also see the value of the other services we offer on our platform. To achieve the easier and more personalized experience of the Connected Trip, we've always intended for AI technology to be at the center of this vision. At each of our brands, our teams of AI experts continue to draw on their valuable experience as they incorporate AI technology into our platforms. We believe that our proprietary data, along with our resources and scale, position us well to build compelling and personalized AI-powered offerings for our travelers and partners. This technology will also enable us to drive further efficiency in our own operations. We have significant activity in this area across the company, and I'll briefly discuss just a few of the encouraging efforts that are underway across our brands. Last summer, Booking.com launched its AI trip planner. And since the launch, Booking.com has gained valuable insights from its millions of interactions with bookers, as well as from the use of the Gen AI technology alongside our existing machine-learning models. The learnings from the AI trip planner are leading to new applications of Gen AI technology, including a recent launch of our smart filter, which makes over 200 potential search filters findable through a free text interface. These innovations also extend to the partner-facing side of the business at Booking.com. Gen AI is being leveraged to help properties write responses to traveler queries, and this tool has led to an increase in response rates to traveler messengers. This improves the experience for our travelers and partners. Booking.com is also testing a Gen AI-powered partner Chatbot to help with questions during the onboarding process and accelerate sign-ups, starting with a focus on alternative accommodation properties. Booking.com is also working to incorporate Gen AI into its customer service function to drive increased efficiency and a better experience for travelers. Initial testing shows meaningful improvements in topic detection in Booking.com's customer help center as well as customer service agent case summarization. Booking.com is still early in this journey and sees meaningful opportunities in improving customer service and driving greater efficiency by leveraging AI in the future. At Priceline, travelers have now had over 3 million interactions with its generative AI travel assistant called Penny. This was launched last summer. While Penny was originally positioned at the end of the funnel on the checkout page, it's now available across the full booking experience and can address many types of traveler questions, including destination discovery, hotel search and trip support. In October, Priceline launched Penny Voice, which enables Penny to engage in verbal conversations with travelers and to assist them with planning trips, searching for hotels and servicing bookings. As Priceline continues to enhance this offering, we envision that Penny will be able to anticipate needs based on preferences and past interaction, and then respond in a real-time voice. While there has been great progress in the development of Penny over the last year, Priceline is focused on further enhancing Penny over time by leveraging their valuable learnings so far. In Agoda, over 120 use cases for GenAI have been implemented across customer service, software development, content generation, product, finance and HR. Agoda is highly focused on leveraging Gen AI to automate product development using both externally and internally developed tools. This is leading to an increase in the share of code written by AI as well as measurable improvements in productivity per developer and development time. In March, Kayak launched its Ask Kayak travel Planning tool, which improves and personalizes the search experience by allowing travelers to use free-form text entries to search and refine the results. At the same time, Kayak, also launched PriceCheck, a price comparison tool that allows travelers to upload a screenshot of a flight intinerary, which Kayak can then check against many different sites in order to determine if there is a better price available for the traveler. At OpenTable, an AI voice bot has been recently integrated into its offering to help participating restaurants answer their phones. Diners can call these restaurants and perform tasks like making a reservation, altering their reservation, asking questions and noting dietary restrictions, which are then automatically updated into OpenTable software. OpenTable has also partnered with Salesforce Agent Force platform. This helps its customer service agents better serve its restaurants and diners. This platform is now handling restaurant web queries, which is helping agents focus on delivering great service in more complex situations. It's exciting to see the work happening across our company to integrate Gen AI into our platforms and the knowledge hearing that is ongoing between all of our brands. We know we are still in the very early days of Gen AI and we have much more to learn about consumers, how they ultimately want to interact with this new technology, but I remain confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI development and to improve our products for our customers given our many years of experience in AI, our travel-related data, connections to our supply partners and our human and financial capital. Over time, as we further incorporate this technology, we expect to see benefits in traveler and partner acquisition, retention and satisfaction. In addition, we expect it to improve operational efficiency, which will contribute to a deceleration of our fixed expense growth in the future. Finally, as I mentioned at the start of the call, we continue to be optimistic about our long-term outlook for Asia. We see Asia as strategically important due to its size, growth potential and our positioning in the region. We estimate that the travel industry growth in Asia will be in the high single-digits over the next five years, which is the highest market growth rate of our major regions. Our ambition is to continue to grow faster than the overall travel industry in Asia as we have done through the pandemic recovery. Over the last 12 months, about 24% of our global room nights were booked by bookers in the Asia region, which is a slightly higher mix than it was prior to the pandemic. Our business in Asia is diversified across the countries in the region with no single country representing more than a low single-digit percentage of our global room nights. The success we have seen in Asia and our solid positioning in the region has been driven by operating two complementary brands, Agoda and Booking.com. Our approach is to utilize both of these brands across the region with an eye on profitable growth for Booking Holdings over the long run. In conclusion, I'm encouraged by our strong third quarter results and the continued resilience of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well for the long term. We remain confident in the long-term growth of travel and in the many opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. Hi, Justin. It's Glenn speaking. I'll take the first question about AI and then I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about your question regarding fourth quarter. So we did give a number of examples about some of the things we're working on at the company on AI because I know there's a lot of curiosity about where are we, what's happening and it is one of the most exciting times I've -- this company ever. And it's something I've talked about before, maybe you've heard me talk in some conferences, et-cetera, that this type of technology is really transformational and it's going to make it so much better for all people in the travel industry, particularly for the traveler. It's also going to enable us to be able to provide a better service to our partners, enabling them to get more incremental, more targeted customers, help their business better. You, of course, you'd like to know how does that translate into dollars and cents. That is difficult at this time. It's still very, very early. We see some of the efficiencies already coming in some places. And we've mentioned and I mentioned in the prepared remarks about some of the numbers in terms of number of people using it, which is actually a relatively small number compared to the total number of interactions we have with customers. Sounds like a big number, 3 million, where that's a big number, but it's small compared to the size of this company. So I know what you'd like to know, but we're not going to project those kind of numbers right now. But what I will say is, it's incredibly important the companies that are successful in AI are going to be the long-term winners because it is going to, as I say, be transformational. I'm very pleased that we've made progress so far and we have some certain advantages. We've got capital. We've got people who have been working with AI now for many, many years. Sure, it wasn't Gen AI. They're working on machine learning model, et cetera, but we've got a lot of people who are very, very skilled in the areas of technology. In addition, having more data, which is so important to be able to combine with other people's large language models, other people's systems and come up with really unique ways to provide a better service. It's something that I'm just so thrilled to see what we're doing, what we're building. And I urge anybody who's curious about this, test out some of the things we have out there. It's out in the market. It's live, it's real. See what you think of it. I've done it a lot myself and sometimes I'm really pleased, sometimes a little disappointed, but I know we're making great progress. And in the future, we'll be able to better quantify for you what you'd like to know. Ewout I'll let you go into fourth quarter. Hi, Mark. I'm not sure if you're right actually on that thing about calling out Asia. I think we had some things where Asia has done better, but regardless of that, let's just talk a little bit about how pleased we are with the growth we're seeing in Asia. And yes, we're obviously getting a bit of a benefit because Asia overall as a market is growing fast. There were certain areas of Asia that were a little slower coming out of the pandemic and such. But this is an opportunity for me to really put out a thanks to our Agoda team. That team has been just doing really well in coming up with ways to provide a better service to the Asia customers. It's a little bit different in some parts. Now I say Asia, obviously, Asia is a very big place, a lot of different countries, a lot of different ways people buy what people are looking for. And the Agoda team has done a good job of localization of coming up with ways that the customer in different parts of Asia, the way they want to buy, matching up with different types of payment methods, for example, to be able to -- that the local person who wants to pay in a certain way can use our service and feel comfortable doing that. In addition, making sure we're getting great inventory. Again, can be a little different in Asia than other parts where there's a lot of small independence or different ways to get great pricing, make sure it's showing up on our site. So great team effort by everybody there in Agoda and that's helping great deal of booking, also doing Asia efforts. So overall, we're really, really pleased with what's happening there. Now your second question about alternative accommodations, we are pleased, again, with the growth rate there, 14%, like it, increasing the listings to 7.9 million, 10% increase in list like that one too. You know last time in the call, I said how we had beaten our biggest homes competitor 11 of the last 12 times and we came out of that time ahead of them in terms of the earnings announcement, I didn't know if we're going to beat them again and we did. So I'm wondering this time will we do it again, maybe at 13 quarters out of 14 and it's not a small business. It's a big business because as we mentioned a couple of times, the total amount of room nights for alternative accommodation is running roughly a little bit two-thirds of the biggest homes player in this market. So it's a big business. So it's great to be able to growing at this size and it's great to be doing in sort of the leading in terms of growth. Your question is, at what stage do we end up and feel sort of that sort of the max or so? I don't know because one of the key things to our business is making sure that we just get as much of the inventory that the customer wants on the site and they choose. And I mentioned it in the remarks about how customers come to our site and from what they've chosen to start with, we know what they were thinking of and then they go and they buy something else. So a key thing to our business is making sure we provide whatever the customer wants and not try and steer them. So I don't know what the ultimate share is going to be. I do know though what's important is to continue to work on getting great inventory. And as long as we're talking about it, we're nowhere near in certain regions sort of getting it. It's a lot of ramp left in front of us. US in particular, I keep repeating myself quarter-after-quarter. Sure, we're growing that business nicely in the U.S., but there's so much more to be done. And I was just looking today, literally today because seeing what was available for us in the Hamptons, I'm a New Yorker. I look into the summer, it's like not enough inventory there yet. So some people can say that's a negative. I say that's you know an opportunity for us and I'm really looking forward to continue to build out the business. And I'll just add, I think what Ewout said really hit a lot of the key things that have made us successful. And looking back, there have been a lot of times that people have questioned what are we investing in and why we're spending the money there, et cetera. And we're now finally beginning to see a little bit of the benefit to this. So there was a point where, as you know, Booking.com was totally an agency business, totally an agency business, no payments at all. Now we talk about our merchant mix is now 65% and we talk about how important it was to have that as a foundational pillar for our connected trip, which is another area where people question, why are you getting out of hotels? Why are you getting into these other verticals? The end of the day is long term success of a company is being able to make change, to make things different as the world changes, you have to change with it. If we just stayed as an agency-only hotel and not had invested in other areas, we will not be where we are today. Now going forward, we can't stop. We continue to do that. So as Ewout said, we've got to be very careful, where are we spending our money. We've got to not put money into things that are not going to be productive and move resources into place that is -- of something is no longer necessary, we just have to have the will to stop that and do something else. So I'm really proud that we've been able to -- I've been here now almost 25 years. It will be 25 years in February. And throughout this, we have changed tremendously, but the one thing that we really concentrate on is making sure we are careful with our shareholders' money. That's a very interesting question because I haven't noticed any surveying or trying to understand. Obviously, we can see if we look at it, a customer has come who we've never seen before, we started with an alternative accommodation because they knew that we had alternate accommodations and that would be completely incremental because we have alternate location accommodations. I don't have the data on that, but I can say, I believe without actual data proof, I believe that we have brought in people who would not have come otherwise, would have gone to another site, but came to us because we did offer them an alternative accommodation. And I would say specifically in Europe, I'm almost certain of that because the awareness of our alternative accommodations business in Europe is very high unlike in other parts of the world. So when somebody thinks that I want to have a nice villa in Nice and France, they will think booking.com and that is the incrementality that you're asking about. But again, what's more important is to offering all aspects of travel that goes back to the whole connected trip vision because if somebody does get that nice villa, they have to get there somehow. So if they're going to fly, it's good to be able to combine that. And then they'll have to get from the airport to the villa. So it's nice to have the ground transportation, maybe they need insurance. And as I always say, nobody goes on a holiday, so they can sit in the room, whether it be a villa, even this really nice one or a hotel room, they want to do stuff and that's why attractions is important. I can go on and on and on. And tying that all together in that connected trip vision using science, using data, using our Gen AI capabilities to make sure we're offering the optimal things for that traveler in addition given the opportunities for our suppliers to offer up different types of service at different price points so that they too can enjoy the benefits of this connected vision in terms of more customers, more profitability. That's the thing we're building. That's the real true incrementality and that is getting people whoever they're traveling right now some other way that they come to us because we offer them a better service. I would say absolutely, Lee, there is a big opportunity to do that. But there's always the flip side of how much opportunity do we have to reinvest in the business. So again, coming to the two sides of the coin that I was talking about before, do we have opportunities to find more opportunities for operating leverage, not only in 2025, but also in 2026, absolutely. And of course, some of the initiatives that are being worked on or under development or have been recently implemented, the run rate effects, you will see that coming in then over time in the future. But as I said as well is, I think this company -- the uniqueness of this company is it's doing well, it's growing fast, it's delivering very strong results. We have a lot of free cash flow generation, but we also can reinvest in so many initiatives in order to grow even faster, grow even faster in all those different areas. So how that on a net basis will play out, that's a little bit hard to say. But on the growth basis, in the sense of how much can we really find in terms of efficiencies, I think there's still a long way to go. So, this is Glenn speaking, I'll let Ewout talk a little bit if he wants about anything that I don't mention. But we are pleased that we are seeing good results from putting money to work in social platforms. And as you know, over many years, we had mentioned that we were experimenting, but it wasn't really working for us yet. And now finally, we are beginning to see it work. That being said, it's a relatively small amount of money compared to our overall marketing expenses, but we're glad. And the thing is, it always comes out that we're agnostic. As long as we get the right ROI, that's what we really -- you, know our goal is, that's what we care about and it's working now more than in the past because I think cooperation with people in the social platform areas that we're working with people there and coming up with creative ways together to achieve our mutual goals. And we want to continue to do that and we'll continue to invest so long as we keep getting the ROIs that we want, that's as simple as it is. How big could it be? I don't know. It really will depend on how much further ahead we keep the ROIs. In the past, in the past, we had seen some interesting things that worked a little bit, but then when you try to scale it, the ROIs fell off. Now we're not really seeing that in the things we're trying now. But I can't promise that, you know, as we grow bigger and bigger, you start getting to large numbers, real large numbers like when our number -- our total amount we spend on marketing, who knows, but I am encouraged by the progress we have made so far and I am really glad to be able to diversify that pay performance type spend. And, Ewout, you want to say anything on it? So you're right on your second point about it's not as easy yet as some of our competitors. I know that's true and that's one of the things we're working on. I'll be sure to say that's opportunity for us. That's great. We're doing so well right now and we still haven't perfected that. So that's all upside for us. In terms of awareness, we're still not where we'd like to be, but we continue to improve. I continue to see those numbers going up. When I look at the reports, marketing comes back -- market report comes back to me, reports our marketing department comes back to me. I am pleased with the progress we're making. But again, that's more opportunity for us. Ewout anything specific on that? Sure. So two separate questions. Let me talk first a little bit about AI in general and the ability for us versus others. This stuff is not easy. It's complicated. Gen AI is hard stuff and it's really good to be in a position where you have resources, people, capital, data to be able to drive forward experiments to see what works, what doesn't work, see how well, how quickly it works. And there's no doubt this is an advantage. So if you're a hotel, even an extremely large hotel, you don't have -- you do not have the resources that we have, I believe. Now, of course, you can partner with others. In fact, we're doing that ourselves. An example, we have, you know, go to OpenTable example, they're not building so much themself. They're partnering with us; they did a good agreement with Salesforce to work with their new AI service that's great there. But I believe it's really important to be able to combine your own data in the hotels accommodations area and come up with things that are truly differentiating and personalization. So I am confident that we have, I'd say, the pole position in the growth of this area, and I'm very excited about it. The other thing you mentioned about our partnerships in Asia with some other players, it's a very small amount of business. Look, we're pleased with where our relationships are with them, et cetera. But that is not something that is -- should be seen as anything that was influencing our Asia numbers at all. Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees and our stockholders. We greatly appreciate everyone's support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you and good night."

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings' speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and Ewout Steenbergen. Go ahead, gentlemen.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. I am proud to report second quarter results that exceeded the high end of our expectations for room nights and revenue. The upside on revenue, combined with lower-than-expected fixed OpEx growth, helped drive adjusted EBITDA above the high end of our prior guidance range. As expected, the travel market has continued to normalize and we are pleased with the strength of our underlying business. Moving to our key metrics in the second quarter. Our travelers booked 287 million room nights across our platforms, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Revenue of $5.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion, both increased 7% year-over-year. Finally, adjusted earnings per share grew 11% year-over-year, helped by our strong capital return program which reduced our average share count by 7% year-over-year. In line with our expectations, we saw that the booking window expanded less in the second quarter relative to the first quarter which negatively impacted room night growth compared to Q1. From a regional perspective, we observed a mild moderation of travel market growth in Europe. However, we believe we're continuing to perform well relative to the market in Europe. Looking at our other regions, we continue to see high growth levels in Asia and a slight improvement in growth in the U.S. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we believe room night growth will be impacted by a booking window that expands less than it did in Q2 as well as by the more moderate market growth we have seen in Europe, where our growth has remained stable from May through July. We expect that this will result in some deceleration in room night growth compared to Q2. Ewout will provide further details on our second quarter results and our thoughts about the third quarter. I remain confident in the attractive long-term growth profile of the travel industry, our competitive position over the long term and our long-term growth and earnings model. We remain focused on what is important for the business for the long term which means continuing to execute against our strategic initiatives while simultaneously taking actions to drive more cost efficiency in the business. We continue to see progress across several important initiatives which include advancing our connected trip addition, expanding our merchant offering at Booking.com, continuing to develop our AI capabilities, growing alternative accommodations and enhancing our Genius loyalty program. These initiatives all fit together in our ongoing effort to deliver a better planning, booking and travel experience for our travelers while also benefiting our supplier partners. We believe that continuing to drive benefits to our supplier partners is critical to successfully operating a growing 2-sided marketplace. We are encouraged to see healthy second quarter year-over-year growth in a number of supply partners working with us at Booking.com. We are focused on being a trusted and valuable partner by delivering incremental travel demand and developing products and features to help support these accommodation properties, the majority of which are small and independent businesses. We believe that improving the competitiveness and profitability of our smaller partners and supporting those partners across macroeconomic cycles contributes to the long-term economic health of our sector. Our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com continues to benefit from having more listings available for travelers to choose from. At the end of Q2, our global alternative accommodation listings were about 7.8 million which is about 11% higher than Q2 last year. We believe this greater selection of listings is contributing to the increasing mix of alternative accommodation room nights booked on our platform. We continue to make incremental enhancements to our alternative accommodation offering for both our travelers and supply partners. For our travelers, we are focused on successfully delivering a better planning, booking and travel experience over time which we believe will lead travelers to choose to book directly and more frequently with us. At Booking.com, we are continuing to grow the number of total active travelers with repeat travelers growing at an even faster rate. In terms of direct booking behavior, we are pleased to see that the direct booking channel continues to grow faster than room nights acquired through paid marketing channels. As I've stated before, we think it's important for us to remain proactive in paid marketing channels in order to bring new travelers to our platforms so long as we're able to do this at attractive ROIs. In addition, I'm encouraged by the work our team at Booking.com is doing to increase our spend on social media in a disciplined manner which is an effort that helps to further diversify the channels we utilize while reaching our travelers on platforms they are actively using. Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com plays an important role in helping to drive more travelers to choose to book directly with us over time. We see a meaningfully higher direct booking mix for Genius users versus other users. And that direct mix percentage steps up at each higher level of Genius status. So we are encouraged to see continued success and more of our travelers moving into the higher Genius tiers of levels 2 and 3 which now represent nearly 30% of our active travelers. In addition to a higher direct booking rate, we also see higher booking frequency from our Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers when compared to our overall business. In Q2, we drove more Genius benefits to our travelers with a 15% year-over-year increase in benefits. This is primarily driven by accommodation bookings. However, we are seeing growth in benefits and the other elements of travel as well with triple-digit growth in Genius discounts for car rental off of a small base last year and continued testing of Genius benefits for flights. In addition to these benefits, bookings in travel verticals outside of combinations contribute to a traveler's Genius level tier. We will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our Genius loyalty program and deliver more benefits to our travelers. And we know that Genius is a win-win with our supplier partners, enabling them to get incremental demand when they want it which is one reason more of our supplier partners are electing to participate. On the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make the planning, booking and travel experience easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. In order to achieve the easier, more personalized experience of the connected trip, we have always envisioned AI technology at the center of this vision. Our teams of AI experts continue to draw on their valuable experience from using AI extensively for many years as they work to further incorporate this technology into our platforms. We believe our proprietary data, along with our resource and scale, position us well to build compelling AI-powered offerings over time. Another foundational element of the connected trip is the merchant offering that we continue to expand at Booking.com. Merchant capabilities will help bring different elements of travel together in a seamless booking experience while also unlocking the ability to merchandise across verticals. The mix of merchant gross bookings reached 58% of total gross bookings at Booking.com in the second quarter which is an increase of 10 percentage points year-over-year and is higher than our prior expectations. We are pleased to see that processing transaction through Booking.com's merchant offering generated incremental contribution margin dollars in the quarter, though this was still a small percentage of our total adjusted EBITDA. We continue to see growth in transactions that are connected to another booking from a different vertical in a trip. These connected transactions increased by about 45% year-over-year in the second quarter and can change or represent a high single-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions. We believe by providing a better overall booking experience, travelers may choose to book more trips with us with a higher likelihood of booking directly in the future. Flights are an important component for many of the connected trips that our travelers are booking. In the second quarter, air tickets booked on our platform increased 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering as well as strong growth in Agoda's flight business. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers coming to Booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the rate that these customers and returning customers see the value of the other services offered on our platform. In conclusion, we continue our work to deliver a better offering experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry, we are positive about our future and we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen.\nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I will now review our results for the second quarter and provide our thoughts for the third quarter and the full year. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now let's move to our second quarter results. Our room nights in the second quarter grew 7% which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 1 percentage point. As expected, we saw room nights growth moderate from the first quarter as we saw less year-over-year expansion of the booking window in the second quarter. Looking at our room night growth by region, in the second quarter, Europe was up mid-single digits. Asia was up mid-teens, rest of world was up high single digits and the U.S. was up mid-single digits. We continue to grow our alternative accommodations business faster than our overall business. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our second quarter room night growth was 12% and the global mix of room nights was 36% which was up 2 percentage points from the second quarter of 2023. We continue to see encouraging progress in strengthening direct relationships with our travelers and increasing loyalty on our platforms. Over the last 4 quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid-50% range and when we exclude our B2B business was in the low 60% range. We've seen both of these mixes continue to increase year-over-year. Mobile ad mix of our total room night was about 53% which was up 6 percentage points from the second quarter of 2023. We continue to see that the significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel. For our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com, we continue to see a year-over-year increase in the mix of room nights booked by travelers in the higher Genius tiers of levels 2 and 3. These members booked more than half of the room nights over the past 4 quarters. Outside of accommodations, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the second quarter increased 28%, about in line with our expectations, driven by the continued growth of flight offerings of Booking.com and Agoda. Second quarter growth in bookings increased 4% which was approximately 3 percentage points lower than the 7% room night growth due to about 2 percentage points of negative impact from changes in FX and about 1% lower constant currency accommodation ADRs. The year-over-year ADR decline was negatively impacted by a higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were about flat versus 2023. While room night growth was above the high end of our guidance range, gross bookings growth came in at the midpoint of our range due to about 2% lower constant currency accommodation ADRs versus our expectation. In addition, our gross bookings were negatively impacted by lower flight ticket prices in line with the recent trends we have heard from many airlines. Second quarter revenue of $5.9 billion grew 7% year-over-year which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 1 percentage point. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 2 percentage points from the change in Easter timing and 2 percentage points from changes in FX. Adjusting for these two items, revenue would have grown about 11%. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.1% which was slightly higher than expected due to a timing benefit as we saw gross bookings growth decelerate in the quarter and a less expanded booking window than expected. Additionally, revenue associated with payments was higher than expected. Marketing expense which is a highly variable expense line increased 8% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 4.7%, about 15 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023, due primarily to the timing of brand marketing spend as well as increased spend in social media channels. Second quarter adjusted sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 1.9%, about 15 basis points higher than last year due to a higher merchant mix and higher transaction taxes. Our more fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 5% and were below our expectation across all three line items: personnel, G&A and IT. We're very focused on carefully managing the growth of our more fixed expenses and are taking actions to help improve our operating leverage in future quarters. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion was above our expectations, largely driven by higher revenue and lower-than-expected fixed expenses. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7%, despite approximately 5 percentage points of pressure from Easter timing and 2 percentage points from changes in FX. Adjusting for these two items, adjusted EBITDA would have grown about 14%. When looking at our adjusted EBITDA margins, for the first half of 2024 which neutralizes the impact of the Easter timing shift, we're pleased to see 160 basis points of margin expansion versus the first half of 2023. Adjusted net income of over $1.4 billion was up 3%, slower than the growth in adjusted EBITDA, due primarily to higher income tax expenses which was impacted by some discrete items. Adjusted EPS of $41.90 per share was up 11% and benefited from a 7% lower average share count than the second quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was over $1.5 billion in the second quarter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our second quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.8 billion was up versus our first quarter ending balance of $16.4 billion due to about $2.4 billion of free cash flow generated in the quarter, partially offset by about $1.9 billion of capital return, including share repurchases and dividends. Moving to our thoughts for the third quarter. We expect third quarter room night growth to be between 3% and 5%, a sequential deceleration as we expect the third quarter to benefit less from a year-over-year expansion of the booking window than we saw in the second quarter. For the third quarter, we expect the booking window to be more similar to last year. Additionally, we have seen a mild moderation in the market growth in Europe over the last couple of months, though our growth in Europe has remained stable from May through July and we believe we continue to perform well relative to the market. We expect third quarter gross bookings growth to be between 2% and 4%, slightly below room night growth due to about 1 percentage point of negative impact from changes in FX. We expect constant currency ADRs to be down slightly year-over-year and for this to be offset by a slight benefit on flight bookings growth. While we continue to expect growth in flight bookings, we believe this will be less than previously expected due to lower flight ticket prices. We expect third quarter revenue growth to be between 2% and 4%. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between about $3.25 billion and $3.35 billion, about flat year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow slower than revenues due to deleverage from sales and other expenses and from growth in IT expenses related to higher software license fees and increased cloud cost. We expect third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth to also be negatively impacted by 1 percentage point from changes in FX. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we're adjusting our gross bookings growth expectation to faster than 6% which is a bit lower than our prior expectation due to less growth in flight growth bookings as a result of the lower flight ticket prices I previously mentioned. While flight prices have come down, we still expect strong growth in flight tickets for the year as we continue to expand the flight offerings at Booking.com and Agoda. We expect accommodation ADRs will be about flat to down slightly on a constant currency basis. For revenue, we now expect revenue growth of more than 7% which is a bit higher than our prior guidance, based on the outperformance in the first half of the year and our expectation for higher revenue associated with payments. Revenue is impacted to a much lesser extent than gross bookings from the decline in flight ticket prices. We continue to expect about 1 percentage point of negative impact from changes in FX on our topline growth rates while reducing our fixed OpEx growth expectation to low double digits as we continue to focus on bringing this growth rate down over time. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow in the high single digits which is slightly faster growth than our prior expectation, given our outlook for increased revenue growth and lower fixed OpEx growth. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit less than 8 percentage point. Finally, we're increasing our adjusted EPS growth expectation to above 15%. In conclusion, we continue to expect 2024 to be a strong year for the company. We remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives while taking actions to drive greater operating leverage. We're excited about our long-term vision for the connected trip and enhancing our offering through technology innovation like generative AI. And with that, we will now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore.\nMark Mahaney: I was just asking about the European travel conditions, Glenn and Ewout. It sounded like that market may be slowing a little bit but if I'm capturing it right, your performance there seems to have been pretty steady, that sort of indicates market share shifts, market share gains. Any more color on that? Why you would be -- why your performance would be relatively unchanged, I guess, in a slowing European travel market environment?\nGlenn Fogel: Mark, it's Glenn. I agree with what you say. I'm very pleased with where we're sitting right now. We've talked in the past about normalization and we're happy with the numbers that we're seeing so far. Your question sort of assumed a softening of the travel business overall. Let's talk about how much and to what extent. Our goal always is to gain share. Whether the market goes up or the market goes down, I can't control demand. I can't control economies. What I can control is how well we can provide value to the travelers and to the suppliers. And as long as we continue to do that, as long as we continue to provide a reason that people should come to us as a traveler or use us as a way to distribute somebody's travel suppliers, we'll continue to gain. And we've seen this in the long run here and I expect to continue to see it in the long run going forward. I can't really give more than that right now.\nEwout Steenbergen: And Mark, if I may quickly build on the answer that Glenn just gave, it's also important to point out that actually our growth in Europe has been quite steady and stable in the period from May through July. So yes, we are seeing some mild moderation but it has been relatively stable over the last couple of months.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen.\nKevin Kopelman: Great. Could you maybe give a little bit more color on some of the moderation you're seeing, like other indicators, like length of stay or any trading down activity that you might be seeing? And given that things have started to slow, how do you gain confidence that they're not going to continue to slow both in room nights and rates?\nEwout Steenbergen: Kevin, if you look at the overall conditions of the market, we're not really seeing a trade down on a global basis. So both in terms of the star ratings as well as in the length of stay, it's relatively stable to what we have seen in previous periods. Maybe with one exception is a really mild indication of some trade down in the U.S. but otherwise, globally, we see a very steady picture.\nKevin Kopelman: And a quick follow-up on ad spend dynamics with the deleveraging expected in the third quarter. Is that more of the same in terms of brand and social spend?\nEwout Steenbergen: If you look at deleverage in the third quarter, that mostly relates to SNO and fixed OpEx. Marketing, actually, we expect leverage -- to see leverage in the second half of this year and also from a longer-term perspective because we expect to continue to see some benefit from the expansion in the direct mix. I also would like to point out and we think it's a really positive message for this call, that we are spending more on social media channels. That's a very attractive channel for us where we are expanding now and where we're investing more and we can do that at very attractive incremental ROI. So really an important point to really highlight with respect to our marketing leverage and the success we're gaining there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\nJustin Post: Great. Glenn, I'd love to hear your perspective on the travel market, bookings growing 3% to 5%. We know Europe has a really tough comp against reopening last year. Is that kind of how you're thinking about longer-term market growth? Or do you think it's kind of depressed right now on really difficult comps? And then love to hear about alternative accommodations, really, really strong growth there, an increasing percentage. Are you featuring that more on your website? And do you really like the economics of accommodations? How do you feel about those economics versus hotel?\nGlenn Fogel: Justin, so two separate questions. One, just going back to the general sense of the travel market. And we talk about this a lot over many, many, many calls about how much we believe that the travel market is best influenced by GDP and that in the long run, GDP goes up, more people travel, more people couldn't travel, get wealthy enough that they can travel, that's a tailwind for us. And we talk about other things. You mentioned the 3% to 5%. I mean, lots of people can come up with whatever way you want in terms of global, what's global GDP? What's it going to do to travel? Numbers aren't that different or some are probably in that neighborhood, then how much additional can we get out of increasing share because we provide a good service. And then, of course, there are the other tailwinds of the off-line to the online, another one that's a point in our favor. All these things together blew the -- the growth algorithm that we've talked about in the past is totally intact. There's going to be volatility, there's going to be variations, there's going to be events are going to happen globally, macro events that happen that can influence a quarter or a week or a day. But in the long run, we just continue to build what we've been trying to build for a long time which is a better service and that's how we do it. And one of the things we've been building and we've been working hard on and I've talked about it for a number of years, how important it is for us to build an alternative accommodations business that will rival anybody's. And we admitted that it was taking us time to build it. We started from behind. Another company may have had a bigger head start on us and building it bigger. We think we've done a really good job of catching up. I love the last call we did a few months ago when we came out and we talked about it, our homes business, our homes business, more than 2/3 of the biggest player in the industry. In that last quarter, we said how we had grown faster, 11 of the last 12 quarters. Now, I don't know if our 12% is going to win or not this time, I don't know. I'm pleased with that growth rate, given the size of the business. And how are we doing it? We're doing it by doing what we do with all things is provide a reason, I said this just to Mark earlier, is that continue to build out a product that gives a person a reason to come and use it. Now I don't really care whether the customer uses a home, or a hotel, or a villa or an igloo. I don't care. I care they get what they want. That's the important thing. And then come back. In terms of the profitability of one versus the other, we can go into that and talk about it but it's not really relevant. Because what's relevant is making sure that they use what they want. We don't try and steer them. We're trying to just make sure they have the best tools to choose what they need in the long run. That's the way we'll win and create a great business.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.\nDoug Anmuth: Glenn, just curious, first, how you're interpreting the relative tightening of the booking window and what does that tell you about the state of the traveler into the back half? And then just curious, in your outlook, how much are you contemplating? Any impact from the tech issues that we've seen over the last couple of weeks and their impact to airlines as well?\nGlenn Fogel: Right. Sure. So the booking window is an interesting thing and we saw it expanding, expanding, expanding and at some point it has to stop, right? I mean, eventually, you can't keep getting bigger and bigger. One of the things I was wondering was why. Why was it expanding? Was it expanding because of inflation and people trying to book early to get that price locked up, afraid that was going to be more expensive down the road. And then now maybe they're thinking well, maybe rates aren't going to keep on increasing, so I can wait. Maybe I'll get a lower price later. I don't know and I haven't done any data to analyze and come up with what the reason is. The fact is, window gets bigger and the window gets smaller. That, of course, influences any particular quarter but in the long run, it all averages out. So I'm not going to worry too much about that. What we do make sure though is make sure that we're spending the right amount of marketing money to try and get the right conversion, do it the right ROI and that's what we continue to do and we're very careful with that. But again, another thing, just like the economies, I can't control what people are going to decide when they want to book. In regard to the tech thing, the tech issues, if you assume you're talking about the horrific events that disrupted travel throughout the world but particularly hit some of our supplier partners significantly. Delta, horrific event and I saw the CEO's interview on Squawk Box and read about what they're planning to do. It's a problem when you have critical infrastructure breaks down and then disrupts millions and millions of people's lives. That's really unfortunate. And hopefully, it won't happen again. Hopefully, people test their products before they put them out into the market. And hopefully, there are backups. Things happen but in travel, we know happens a lot. Certainly, weather happens an awful lot. This is something though that wasn't weather which you can't control, this was making sure that your infrastructure works and will be interesting how that lawsuit turns out. I will point out, it didn't affect us very much though. So we're very pleased about that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.\nEric Sheridan: Maybe two questions, if I could. First, following up on sort of the demand environment. When you think about the shift from goods to services that has played out in the economy more broadly in the last couple of years, do you think elements of stability or maybe re-acceleration in terms of demand, it might be down to price? Or do you think it's just time and duration that might have to sort of find a new footing for demand and maybe elements of a potential to return to growth? So will this come down to sort of suppliers and pricing or elements of a new normal and finding a new level. I'm just curious for your perspective there, Glenn. And then in terms of the broader marketing messages, you've been on this journey to sort of rejigger the way you're approaching marketing funnel and driving more direct traffic. What do you see as the key investment priorities built on some of the learnings in the last 12 months that you want to share in terms of how the marketing focus for the company might continue to evolve beyond just 2024?\nGlenn Fogel: So the first more generic question about goods versus services and I think your question, I'm trying to narrow it down to, I think what we're really talking about is we saw a change in people's behavior where they seem to value services significantly more than good which, of course, helps someone like us. And I think the question is, is this a permanent change or appears to go back to a balance that they had a few years ago, maybe pre-pandemic. And I think that in the end, again, this is one of those things that I believe but I don't have proof of is that as people get wealthier, you end up spending more money on services. And it ends up a lot because people generally have one home, you got one couch. You don't keep buying more and more but as your wealth increases, you want to do things, you want to enjoy things. And we see that happening. There's also -- there could be something of the Instagram effect where -- and this is a human nature that you want to show off to your friend, to your friends, all the great things you're doing, I think that definitely has some impact because we certainly -- certain parts of the world that people never used to travel to, now they are being overrun and I think that is the Instagram effect there. So that's all good for our business. I don't know how much further it will go, though, because you need to buy homes and you need to buy couches, et cetera. And I don't see that as a big swing but I'm not concerned that it's going to flip back and we're going to end up with lower; that's one. In terms of the marketing, let's talk a couple of these. I just want to repeat this point I made earlier about. One of the things that we -- I'm happy to see is seeing us making some progress in using social. We have a long problem getting that to work for us for many, many years, just didn't seem to work. But now we're seeing, okay, starting to work, getting some good ROIs. Putting more money into it like that and I think they will continue doing that. Another thing we saw that we don't talk a lot about it, I won't get too specific but we saw ourselves using money that we thought was producing a good ROI and we turned out, it really wasn't. And we shut some of these things down. I won't go into exactly what they were. And we said, that's really not hurting us. We said, \"Well, that's great.\" And that's something that over last year or so that we saw some of the benefit in terms of our marketing leverage is coming from that. So, two good things and I'll let Ewout anything else to say about marketing there.\nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, Eric, maybe to give you another perspective. So I'm now 4.5 months with the company. A lot of joy, a lot of pleasure to be here and a great honor. But I'm also, of course, looking at some of the perceptions of the company. I think it's still very much an outdated perception out there that we are largely dependent in terms of sales in our business on the paid channels. Actually, we're emphasizing a lot as you have heard in our calls around the direct mix and being now in the low 60% level for B2C which is really a game changer from my perspective for the company. Also we're very much diversifying our paid channels which is very important because this is a very dynamic world. The paid channels are changing all the time. They are changing their algorithms. But I'm really impressed about the science that the company has behind its paid channels, the algorithms that we are adjusting to optimizing all the time, the way how we spend our paid marketing dollars and how we're investing that. And so it's -- there is not a silver bullet. It's all the time really the details about the optimization, how to get to the highest number of new customers coming to us through the paid channels in the most optimal way with the most attractive ROIs and super impressed how the company is doing that. And I think that gives us really an edge in terms of how we can deal with paid channels also in the future. Operator, I think you are ready for the next question.\nOperator: And our next question is from James Lee with Mizuho.\nJames Lee: Two here. First, on loyalty program. It seems like one of your major peers is having mixed success with their loyalty program. And maybe, Glenn, you can once again talk about how your program is differentiated and that would allow you to have very high rate of repeat bookings? And secondly, on advertising, I noticed that your ad revenue seem to be under monetized at only 0.7% of gross booking. Is that a source of opportunity as you're looking to give -- to take advantage of scale or your reach? And if so, maybe help us understand what areas are you looking to expand?\nGlenn Fogel: Yes. Sorry about that. Thinking of the answer. I'm going to let Ewout handle the ad opportunity. I'll talk about our loyalty program, Genius which is the Booking.com program which we talked a little bit about in our prepared remarks. We really haven't talked about it much in terms of numbers in the past but I was just really pleased to be able to talk about our Level 2 and Level 3 players. 30% of our active users -- active travelers are Level 2 or Level 3. And we talked about that gives us more than half of the Booking.com business which is really great. That -- and we talk about how they come back more frequently and they come back more direct. That's the point that it works. And one of the great things about it is, for the most part, we're not paying for it. Our partners are supplying almost all the benefit right now but we talk about we are also putting some benefits at a time. We're going to experiment putting more in ourselves. But it's a great thing. You think why do the suppliers do it? They do it because it gets them incremental demand. It gets them demand when they need it, when they want it. It's very flexible. We work together with them, with these partners, so they can get the demand and the reason they get the demand is because our high Genius level people, our high-spending people and they are going to come and they're going to use those services. It's really a win-win-win. Win for our travelers, win for our partners and win for us. There aren't a lot of people who are doing a program like that. So we think it does differentiate. And I'm really happy to see car rental now doing a lot more of it and we're experimenting with flights. And part of the whole vision of the connected trip the Genius program fitting right into that comes with all different types of permutations of ways to provide better benefits to travelers and use it in a way, a scientific way, a data-driven way. A way using all of our AI capabilities, all the data we have so that we can come up with the best solutions for both sides of the marketplace. That is where -- that's what we're driving to. And I see it happening now in some of the numbers we said, I think gives a little indication. And then, of course, there will be the other thing which is really [ph] advertising opportunities are great. And I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about that.\nEwout Steenbergen: James, thank you for pointing out the advertising revenues because it is indeed a very attractive potential line that gives us an opportunity in terms of growing our revenues in the future. Today, this line is mostly coming from KAYAK and OpenTable but there are opportunities, of course, to think about more advertising income from particularly the apps and the active app use that we're having mostly with Agoda and Booking.com. But as everyone knows, this is a very fine line because if you get too many advertisement as a traveler on an app, where you're interested in something else that can ultimately also become quite annoying. So finding there the optimal point is really important. But overall, you're right, that is an opportunity to help to drive further growth with the company in the future, next to many other opportunities we have because I think that's actually -- the exciting part for us as a business, are not just growing with the market. We have so many opportunities to grow faster if it is alternative accommodations we discussed or the multiple verticals around the connected trip we discussed or growing geographically in Asia, in the U.S. around payments, around generative AI and many other opportunities. So definitely, I would put this on the same list as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with UBS.\nStephen Ju: All right. Great. So Glenn, I think I heard you talk in the prepared remarks about connected trips bookings up, I think it was 45% and accounting for a high single-digit percentage of the mix. At this point, is there anything you can share about how the basket size of a particular trip could be moving around and presumably it's up a lot because people are attaching more things. And I guess what the impact to your customer acquisition strategy may be as a result as customer lifetime values go up?\nGlenn Fogel: Sure. Well, I won't give specifics but I'll confirm what you say is true, is that somebody buys two things. It's definitely going to be bigger than one thing. And also because they bought more things, as we use the science, as we use our data, as we use all the capabilities we have to come up with, what is the value for that customer? Well, how much should we spend to attract that person is going to change, obviously. And it's also the question is in terms of loyalty. We found and it does make sense, a more satisfied customer is going to come back more often. And people in the connected trip, people who use the connected trip, we do see a higher repeat rate for a connected trip person. And we see them coming direct. And the great thing about the connected trip too is that in the past, with just one vertical which was the hotel business, we were missing on customers who wanted to start with flights and now with flights, people are starting at flights and they come and they buy something else too. And also, it's the convenience factor and that goes into the whole reason why the connected trip. I've heard from people say, \"Well, what makes you different?\" And the truth is right now, we're semi-different because we don't have the full connected trip done yet, the way I want it to be. But at the end of the day, we all know how frustrating travel is. And we know how much easy it would be if there was just one place, one person who would handle everything for you, put it all together in the way that was the optimal way with all the different things you have to decide upon. And then if anything went wrong, that it would all get fixed. And now with the benefits of GenAI coming out and the progress I see being made with it, I talked to our people in customer service and what we're putting together there, I believe we will create something that truly is differentiating and that will create a reason that people will want to come to us. The more people who come to us, more opportunities we have to work with our partners to provide them opportunities to help build their businesses. Again, I'll get to use it again, I could say win-win-win again, because that's really what we're trying to achieve here.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank.\nLee Horowitz: So the modestly softer travel environment that the industry seems to be expecting in the second half of the year seems to be working through models by way of pricing pressures. I guess, Ewout, can you comment some on how you think about flexing your cost structure going forward to the extent that, say, hotel ADR has become a bigger headwind for the industry and by extension, your adjusted EBITDA margins?\nEwout Steenbergen: Lee, thank you so much for asking the question because we are, at this point in time, really putting much more emphasis on this particular area and looking for more operating leverage for the company in the future. And we should particularly be well positioned to do that because we have the scale. So we should be able to run much more volume over the same fixed infrastructure that we have as a company in the future and take advantage of that. And take advantage of that in the way that we can reinvest in new growth initiatives as well as, of course, also benefiting EBITDA margins and return of capital to our shareholders. So let me give you a couple of examples what we are doing at this moment. We have already done a couple of reorganizations in some of our businesses. We have been looking very carefully at head count, in some places, put a head count pause in place. We are looking at some expense benchmarking in some other brands and businesses, looking at procurement in real estate and many other areas. So more to come on that over the next couple of quarters that I can give you more details. But definitely, this has become a really big focus area. And we are pleased that, therefore, we can also say to you that for the full year guidance, we are now reducing the outlook with respect to fixed OpEx from low to mid-teens to now low double digits. As well as we continue to focus on growing our fixed OpEx at a lower level than the topline growth in 2025.\nLee Horowitz: Really helpful. And then, Glenn, maybe on alternative accommodations, you continue to deliver very healthy supply growth here. Do you feel like you are reaching a point of supply parity relative to your peers in the U.S. specifically, where you can perhaps lean in more aggressively investing against marketing and discounting within this vertical to sort of accelerate share gains?\nGlenn Fogel: I have to admit, I don't believe we are at that level at all right now. But that, to me, is an incredible opportunity. The fact that we are performing as well as we are in terms of our overall number but we still do not have anywhere near the number or the type of home accommodations in the U.S. to be fully competitive is, well, it's a disappointment to me that is not done yet. It's an opportunity where we have all this upside still to come. And we won't be spending huge amounts of money on a subpar product. So not to fear. We're not going to do that. What we're going to do instead to spend the money that we're spending now to make sure we get the properties we need, get the things up and running the way we want the product, the way we want it to be. So nobody ever comes to our site and feels disappointed because it wasn't as good as X. That's what we're working on right now. Clearly, the numbers show that we're doing a good job in many parts of the world but the U.S. is, to me, something that is great opportunity. And for people who live in the New York area, you know if you were looking for -- I use this example all the time because I live in the New York area. If you are looking for a rental, you wanted a home in the Hamptons this summer, you came to our site. You probably said, \"Jesus, there's not a lot here compared to some other people.\" I don't want that to be. I want us to have as many, if not more and I want it to be easier for them to come. I want the trust that coming to Booking is a better way to get that summer rental. And we're going to work on that and that's good for us, an opportunity for us. But your answer is correct. We're not there yet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni with Jefferies.\nJohn Colantuoni: You mentioned direct bookings were mid-50% of total and low 60%, excluding B2B which I think implies your B2B mix decreased from last year, if I'm doing the math correctly. In general -- but in general, B2B is a smaller offering relative to your biggest competitor. And I imagine this was a strategic decision but I'm curious why you're less excited about the opportunity in the B2B relative to some of the other players in the space?\nEwout Steenbergen: John, we are not really recognizing that math. And actually, we are really encouraged by the growth of our B2B business as well. You're right that overall, it's a smaller business than some other players in our industry but we have a couple of propositions that are really strong and all of our brands are actually active in the space. Booking.com is active in this space. Priceline with Getaroom, Agoda with Rocket Travel and many other propositions that we have in the market. So it is an important part of our commercial strategy but it is definitely something that is a bit smaller than other players.\nJohn Colantuoni: Great. And maybe a second one on alternative accommodations. I think just broadly speaking, marketing intensity in the alternative space appears to have escalated a bit year-to-date. Talk about Booking's offering and positioning in the vertical and how that positions you to sort of continue delivering impressive growth if the competitive environment continues to ramp over time?\nEwout Steenbergen: John, I think actually, our proposition is unique with respect to alternative accommodations because we are putting both traditional and alternative accommodations on our same platform. So we have the benefit of all our brand marketing spend, all our paid market spend coming together on the same platform and giving the traveler an opportunity to pick and select their best option. Maybe they're coming in and looking for 2 hotel rooms for their family and ending up by booking an apartment with 2 bedrooms and they're very happy with that outcome. As Glenn said earlier, we are actually agnostic about which direction this is taking customers because it is important that they are finding the best option for them, ultimately, how to travel. We're agnostic from an economics perspective about this. And it is all about making sure we have the most attractive proposition in the market. But this is, from our perspective, a differentiator because we are able to bring all of those supply opportunities together on our platforms as a company.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with B. Riley Securities.\nNaved Khan: Maybe just on this commentary on booking window kind of not expanding as much. Can you maybe just talk about if you're seeing any mix in your cross-border versus domestic bookings and if that might have anything to do with it. And the second question I have is on the U.S. online growth. It seems like it picked up a little bit versus the last quarter. I'm wondering if it was driven by alternative lodging or if that is not the case?\nGlenn Fogel: Ewout, why don't you take that first one and then I'll talk a little bit about the U.S. and the increase we saw in the second quarter versus the first quarter.\nEwout Steenbergen: Naved, the way how we look at booking window is, as Glenn actually commented on a couple of minutes ago, to some extent, it doesn't matter for us. It doesn't matter when a traveler actually books because they will travel at a certain point in time. When they travel, they have the experience. And at that point, we will recognize the revenues and the economics to the company. So if you look at the performance of the business over multiple quarters, this is averaging out. If bookers booked earlier or later, ultimately for the same trip and that can really depend on many factors. It can depend on assumptions what will pricing do over time or locking in certain flights or locking in certain accommodations or other factors why bookers might come to us earlier or later for the same trip. But it is important if any investor looks at us from a medium- and long-term perspective, it doesn't matter because over time, it's averaging out and we will deliver the same results for our shareholders and continue to build our business over time with all the opportunities we have.\nGlenn Fogel: In regards to the U.S. and trying to distinguish, is it because we did better in homes or we did better hotels or -- I really try and stay away from that a little bit. We're trying to provide a traveler with what they need and provide all the different opportunities, whenever. But I'm very happy in the second quarter, accelerated versus the first quarter for our U.S. business. That's very good, I'm pleased by doing better over the long run. But I'm not going to say it's because we did X, Y or Z. In the end, we have to do well in every single part of this business. That means we've got to provide the homes. Absolutely, I talked about that. We got to be a good partner to the hotels and provide them with the incremental demand they need, when they need it. In addition, the connected trip, we got to make sure we're getting all the inventory we can in terms of flights, to making sure we have that ground transportation. And as I always say, nobody goes on a holiday to hang out in the accommodation. They want to do stuff. So we got to make sure we get our attraction things working well and that we're putting up the right offers to the person that they want, when they want at the right time. And of course, there's all the other things, provide the insurance and tying it all together in our merchant platform which we put in our prepared remarks some of the numbers, very pleased about the increase in that. Glad to see it continuing to go up. Glad because it provides a great convenience. It makes it easier to do a lot of things in the connected trip. All working together to provide the ultimate thing which is having a better experience for the traveler and providing more opportunities for our supplier partners. Glad that we're seeing that we did better in America, I'd like to do even better in the long run. I think America, the U.S. is a great opportunity. We continue to under index there which means for me, that's a place that we can do better.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A session. Yes. That was our last question. Thank you so much. And with that, I will hand the call back over to you, Mr. Fogel for closing remarks.\nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. So I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, our shareholders. We greatly appreciate everyone's support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you very much and good night.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn and good afternoon. I will now review our results for the second quarter and provide our thoughts for the third quarter and the full year. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now let's move to our second quarter results. Our room nights in the second quarter grew 7% which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 1 percentage point. As expected, we saw room nights growth moderate from the first quarter as we saw less year-over-year expansion of the booking window in the second quarter. Looking at our room night growth by region, in the second quarter, Europe was up mid-single digits. Asia was up mid-teens, rest of world was up high single digits and the U.S. was up mid-single digits. We continue to grow our alternative accommodations business faster than our overall business. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our second quarter room night growth was 12% and the global mix of room nights was 36% which was up 2 percentage points from the second quarter of 2023. We continue to see encouraging progress in strengthening direct relationships with our travelers and increasing loyalty on our platforms. Over the last 4 quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid-50% range and when we exclude our B2B business was in the low 60% range. We've seen both of these mixes continue to increase year-over-year. Mobile ad mix of our total room night was about 53% which was up 6 percentage points from the second quarter of 2023. We continue to see that the significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel. For our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com, we continue to see a year-over-year increase in the mix of room nights booked by travelers in the higher Genius tiers of levels 2 and 3. These members booked more than half of the room nights over the past 4 quarters. Outside of accommodations, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the second quarter increased 28%, about in line with our expectations, driven by the continued growth of flight offerings of Booking.com and Agoda. Second quarter growth in bookings increased 4% which was approximately 3 percentage points lower than the 7% room night growth due to about 2 percentage points of negative impact from changes in FX and about 1% lower constant currency accommodation ADRs. The year-over-year ADR decline was negatively impacted by a higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were about flat versus 2023. While room night growth was above the high end of our guidance range, gross bookings growth came in at the midpoint of our range due to about 2% lower constant currency accommodation ADRs versus our expectation. In addition, our gross bookings were negatively impacted by lower flight ticket prices in line with the recent trends we have heard from many airlines. Second quarter revenue of $5.9 billion grew 7% year-over-year which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 1 percentage point. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 2 percentage points from the change in Easter timing and 2 percentage points from changes in FX. Adjusting for these two items, revenue would have grown about 11%. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.1% which was slightly higher than expected due to a timing benefit as we saw gross bookings growth decelerate in the quarter and a less expanded booking window than expected. Additionally, revenue associated with payments was higher than expected. Marketing expense which is a highly variable expense line increased 8% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 4.7%, about 15 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023, due primarily to the timing of brand marketing spend as well as increased spend in social media channels. Second quarter adjusted sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 1.9%, about 15 basis points higher than last year due to a higher merchant mix and higher transaction taxes. Our more fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 5% and were below our expectation across all three line items: personnel, G&A and IT. We're very focused on carefully managing the growth of our more fixed expenses and are taking actions to help improve our operating leverage in future quarters. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion was above our expectations, largely driven by higher revenue and lower-than-expected fixed expenses. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7%, despite approximately 5 percentage points of pressure from Easter timing and 2 percentage points from changes in FX. Adjusting for these two items, adjusted EBITDA would have grown about 14%. When looking at our adjusted EBITDA margins, for the first half of 2024 which neutralizes the impact of the Easter timing shift, we're pleased to see 160 basis points of margin expansion versus the first half of 2023. Adjusted net income of over $1.4 billion was up 3%, slower than the growth in adjusted EBITDA, due primarily to higher income tax expenses which was impacted by some discrete items. Adjusted EPS of $41.90 per share was up 11% and benefited from a 7% lower average share count than the second quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was over $1.5 billion in the second quarter. Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our second quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.8 billion was up versus our first quarter ending balance of $16.4 billion due to about $2.4 billion of free cash flow generated in the quarter, partially offset by about $1.9 billion of capital return, including share repurchases and dividends. Moving to our thoughts for the third quarter. We expect third quarter room night growth to be between 3% and 5%, a sequential deceleration as we expect the third quarter to benefit less from a year-over-year expansion of the booking window than we saw in the second quarter. For the third quarter, we expect the booking window to be more similar to last year. Additionally, we have seen a mild moderation in the market growth in Europe over the last couple of months, though our growth in Europe has remained stable from May through July and we believe we continue to perform well relative to the market. We expect third quarter gross bookings growth to be between 2% and 4%, slightly below room night growth due to about 1 percentage point of negative impact from changes in FX. We expect constant currency ADRs to be down slightly year-over-year and for this to be offset by a slight benefit on flight bookings growth. While we continue to expect growth in flight bookings, we believe this will be less than previously expected due to lower flight ticket prices. We expect third quarter revenue growth to be between 2% and 4%. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between about $3.25 billion and $3.35 billion, about flat year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow slower than revenues due to deleverage from sales and other expenses and from growth in IT expenses related to higher software license fees and increased cloud cost. We expect third quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth to also be negatively impacted by 1 percentage point from changes in FX. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we're adjusting our gross bookings growth expectation to faster than 6% which is a bit lower than our prior expectation due to less growth in flight growth bookings as a result of the lower flight ticket prices I previously mentioned. While flight prices have come down, we still expect strong growth in flight tickets for the year as we continue to expand the flight offerings at Booking.com and Agoda. We expect accommodation ADRs will be about flat to down slightly on a constant currency basis. For revenue, we now expect revenue growth of more than 7% which is a bit higher than our prior guidance, based on the outperformance in the first half of the year and our expectation for higher revenue associated with payments. Revenue is impacted to a much lesser extent than gross bookings from the decline in flight ticket prices. We continue to expect about 1 percentage point of negative impact from changes in FX on our topline growth rates while reducing our fixed OpEx growth expectation to low double digits as we continue to focus on bringing this growth rate down over time. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow in the high single digits which is slightly faster growth than our prior expectation, given our outlook for increased revenue growth and lower fixed OpEx growth. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit less than 8 percentage point. Finally, we're increasing our adjusted EPS growth expectation to above 15%. In conclusion, we continue to expect 2024 to be a strong year for the company. We remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives while taking actions to drive greater operating leverage. We're excited about our long-term vision for the connected trip and enhancing our offering through technology innovation like generative AI. And with that, we will now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines? And Mark, if I may quickly build on the answer that Glenn just gave, it's also important to point out that actually our growth in Europe has been quite steady and stable in the period from May through July. So yes, we are seeing some mild moderation but it has been relatively stable over the last couple of months. Kevin, if you look at the overall conditions of the market, we're not really seeing a trade down on a global basis. So both in terms of the star ratings as well as in the length of stay, it's relatively stable to what we have seen in previous periods. Maybe with one exception is a really mild indication of some trade down in the U.S. but otherwise, globally, we see a very steady picture. If you look at deleverage in the third quarter, that mostly relates to SNO and fixed OpEx. Marketing, actually, we expect leverage -- to see leverage in the second half of this year and also from a longer-term perspective because we expect to continue to see some benefit from the expansion in the direct mix. I also would like to point out and we think it's a really positive message for this call, that we are spending more on social media channels. That's a very attractive channel for us where we are expanding now and where we're investing more and we can do that at very attractive incremental ROI. So really an important point to really highlight with respect to our marketing leverage and the success we're gaining there. Yes, Eric, maybe to give you another perspective. So I'm now 4.5 months with the company. A lot of joy, a lot of pleasure to be here and a great honor. But I'm also, of course, looking at some of the perceptions of the company. I think it's still very much an outdated perception out there that we are largely dependent in terms of sales in our business on the paid channels. Actually, we're emphasizing a lot as you have heard in our calls around the direct mix and being now in the low 60% level for B2C which is really a game changer from my perspective for the company. Also we're very much diversifying our paid channels which is very important because this is a very dynamic world. The paid channels are changing all the time. They are changing their algorithms. But I'm really impressed about the science that the company has behind its paid channels, the algorithms that we are adjusting to optimizing all the time, the way how we spend our paid marketing dollars and how we're investing that. And so it's -- there is not a silver bullet. It's all the time really the details about the optimization, how to get to the highest number of new customers coming to us through the paid channels in the most optimal way with the most attractive ROIs and super impressed how the company is doing that. And I think that gives us really an edge in terms of how we can deal with paid channels also in the future. Operator, I think you are ready for the next question. James, thank you for pointing out the advertising revenues because it is indeed a very attractive potential line that gives us an opportunity in terms of growing our revenues in the future. Today, this line is mostly coming from KAYAK and OpenTable but there are opportunities, of course, to think about more advertising income from particularly the apps and the active app use that we're having mostly with Agoda and Booking.com. But as everyone knows, this is a very fine line because if you get too many advertisement as a traveler on an app, where you're interested in something else that can ultimately also become quite annoying. So finding there the optimal point is really important. But overall, you're right, that is an opportunity to help to drive further growth with the company in the future, next to many other opportunities we have because I think that's actually -- the exciting part for us as a business, are not just growing with the market. We have so many opportunities to grow faster if it is alternative accommodations we discussed or the multiple verticals around the connected trip we discussed or growing geographically in Asia, in the U.S. around payments, around generative AI and many other opportunities. So definitely, I would put this on the same list as well. Lee, thank you so much for asking the question because we are, at this point in time, really putting much more emphasis on this particular area and looking for more operating leverage for the company in the future. And we should particularly be well positioned to do that because we have the scale. So we should be able to run much more volume over the same fixed infrastructure that we have as a company in the future and take advantage of that. And take advantage of that in the way that we can reinvest in new growth initiatives as well as, of course, also benefiting EBITDA margins and return of capital to our shareholders. So let me give you a couple of examples what we are doing at this moment. We have already done a couple of reorganizations in some of our businesses. We have been looking very carefully at head count, in some places, put a head count pause in place. We are looking at some expense benchmarking in some other brands and businesses, looking at procurement in real estate and many other areas. So more to come on that over the next couple of quarters that I can give you more details. But definitely, this has become a really big focus area. And we are pleased that, therefore, we can also say to you that for the full year guidance, we are now reducing the outlook with respect to fixed OpEx from low to mid-teens to now low double digits. As well as we continue to focus on growing our fixed OpEx at a lower level than the topline growth in 2025. John, we are not really recognizing that math. And actually, we are really encouraged by the growth of our B2B business as well. You're right that overall, it's a smaller business than some other players in our industry but we have a couple of propositions that are really strong and all of our brands are actually active in the space. Booking.com is active in this space. Priceline with Getaroom, Agoda with Rocket Travel and many other propositions that we have in the market. So it is an important part of our commercial strategy but it is definitely something that is a bit smaller than other players. John, I think actually, our proposition is unique with respect to alternative accommodations because we are putting both traditional and alternative accommodations on our same platform. So we have the benefit of all our brand marketing spend, all our paid market spend coming together on the same platform and giving the traveler an opportunity to pick and select their best option. Maybe they're coming in and looking for 2 hotel rooms for their family and ending up by booking an apartment with 2 bedrooms and they're very happy with that outcome. As Glenn said earlier, we are actually agnostic about which direction this is taking customers because it is important that they are finding the best option for them, ultimately, how to travel. We're agnostic from an economics perspective about this. And it is all about making sure we have the most attractive proposition in the market. But this is, from our perspective, a differentiator because we are able to bring all of those supply opportunities together on our platforms as a company. Naved, the way how we look at booking window is, as Glenn actually commented on a couple of minutes ago, to some extent, it doesn't matter for us. It doesn't matter when a traveler actually books because they will travel at a certain point in time. When they travel, they have the experience. And at that point, we will recognize the revenues and the economics to the company. So if you look at the performance of the business over multiple quarters, this is averaging out. If bookers booked earlier or later, ultimately for the same trip and that can really depend on many factors. It can depend on assumptions what will pricing do over time or locking in certain flights or locking in certain accommodations or other factors why bookers might come to us earlier or later for the same trip. But it is important if any investor looks at us from a medium- and long-term perspective, it doesn't matter because over time, it's averaging out and we will deliver the same results for our shareholders and continue to build our business over time with all the opportunities we have."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. I am proud to report second quarter results that exceeded the high end of our expectations for room nights and revenue. The upside on revenue, combined with lower-than-expected fixed OpEx growth, helped drive adjusted EBITDA above the high end of our prior guidance range. As expected, the travel market has continued to normalize and we are pleased with the strength of our underlying business. Moving to our key metrics in the second quarter. Our travelers booked 287 million room nights across our platforms, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Revenue of $5.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion, both increased 7% year-over-year. Finally, adjusted earnings per share grew 11% year-over-year, helped by our strong capital return program which reduced our average share count by 7% year-over-year. In line with our expectations, we saw that the booking window expanded less in the second quarter relative to the first quarter which negatively impacted room night growth compared to Q1. From a regional perspective, we observed a mild moderation of travel market growth in Europe. However, we believe we're continuing to perform well relative to the market in Europe. Looking at our other regions, we continue to see high growth levels in Asia and a slight improvement in growth in the U.S. As we look ahead to the third quarter, we believe room night growth will be impacted by a booking window that expands less than it did in Q2 as well as by the more moderate market growth we have seen in Europe, where our growth has remained stable from May through July. We expect that this will result in some deceleration in room night growth compared to Q2. Ewout will provide further details on our second quarter results and our thoughts about the third quarter. I remain confident in the attractive long-term growth profile of the travel industry, our competitive position over the long term and our long-term growth and earnings model. We remain focused on what is important for the business for the long term which means continuing to execute against our strategic initiatives while simultaneously taking actions to drive more cost efficiency in the business. We continue to see progress across several important initiatives which include advancing our connected trip addition, expanding our merchant offering at Booking.com, continuing to develop our AI capabilities, growing alternative accommodations and enhancing our Genius loyalty program. These initiatives all fit together in our ongoing effort to deliver a better planning, booking and travel experience for our travelers while also benefiting our supplier partners. We believe that continuing to drive benefits to our supplier partners is critical to successfully operating a growing 2-sided marketplace. We are encouraged to see healthy second quarter year-over-year growth in a number of supply partners working with us at Booking.com. We are focused on being a trusted and valuable partner by delivering incremental travel demand and developing products and features to help support these accommodation properties, the majority of which are small and independent businesses. We believe that improving the competitiveness and profitability of our smaller partners and supporting those partners across macroeconomic cycles contributes to the long-term economic health of our sector. Our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com continues to benefit from having more listings available for travelers to choose from. At the end of Q2, our global alternative accommodation listings were about 7.8 million which is about 11% higher than Q2 last year. We believe this greater selection of listings is contributing to the increasing mix of alternative accommodation room nights booked on our platform. We continue to make incremental enhancements to our alternative accommodation offering for both our travelers and supply partners. For our travelers, we are focused on successfully delivering a better planning, booking and travel experience over time which we believe will lead travelers to choose to book directly and more frequently with us. At Booking.com, we are continuing to grow the number of total active travelers with repeat travelers growing at an even faster rate. In terms of direct booking behavior, we are pleased to see that the direct booking channel continues to grow faster than room nights acquired through paid marketing channels. As I've stated before, we think it's important for us to remain proactive in paid marketing channels in order to bring new travelers to our platforms so long as we're able to do this at attractive ROIs. In addition, I'm encouraged by the work our team at Booking.com is doing to increase our spend on social media in a disciplined manner which is an effort that helps to further diversify the channels we utilize while reaching our travelers on platforms they are actively using. Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com plays an important role in helping to drive more travelers to choose to book directly with us over time. We see a meaningfully higher direct booking mix for Genius users versus other users. And that direct mix percentage steps up at each higher level of Genius status. So we are encouraged to see continued success and more of our travelers moving into the higher Genius tiers of levels 2 and 3 which now represent nearly 30% of our active travelers. In addition to a higher direct booking rate, we also see higher booking frequency from our Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers when compared to our overall business. In Q2, we drove more Genius benefits to our travelers with a 15% year-over-year increase in benefits. This is primarily driven by accommodation bookings. However, we are seeing growth in benefits and the other elements of travel as well with triple-digit growth in Genius discounts for car rental off of a small base last year and continued testing of Genius benefits for flights. In addition to these benefits, bookings in travel verticals outside of combinations contribute to a traveler's Genius level tier. We will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our Genius loyalty program and deliver more benefits to our travelers. And we know that Genius is a win-win with our supplier partners, enabling them to get incremental demand when they want it which is one reason more of our supplier partners are electing to participate. On the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make the planning, booking and travel experience easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. In order to achieve the easier, more personalized experience of the connected trip, we have always envisioned AI technology at the center of this vision. Our teams of AI experts continue to draw on their valuable experience from using AI extensively for many years as they work to further incorporate this technology into our platforms. We believe our proprietary data, along with our resource and scale, position us well to build compelling AI-powered offerings over time. Another foundational element of the connected trip is the merchant offering that we continue to expand at Booking.com. Merchant capabilities will help bring different elements of travel together in a seamless booking experience while also unlocking the ability to merchandise across verticals. The mix of merchant gross bookings reached 58% of total gross bookings at Booking.com in the second quarter which is an increase of 10 percentage points year-over-year and is higher than our prior expectations. We are pleased to see that processing transaction through Booking.com's merchant offering generated incremental contribution margin dollars in the quarter, though this was still a small percentage of our total adjusted EBITDA. We continue to see growth in transactions that are connected to another booking from a different vertical in a trip. These connected transactions increased by about 45% year-over-year in the second quarter and can change or represent a high single-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions. We believe by providing a better overall booking experience, travelers may choose to book more trips with us with a higher likelihood of booking directly in the future. Flights are an important component for many of the connected trips that our travelers are booking. In the second quarter, air tickets booked on our platform increased 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering as well as strong growth in Agoda's flight business. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers coming to Booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the rate that these customers and returning customers see the value of the other services offered on our platform. In conclusion, we continue our work to deliver a better offering experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry, we are positive about our future and we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. Mark, it's Glenn. I agree with what you say. I'm very pleased with where we're sitting right now. We've talked in the past about normalization and we're happy with the numbers that we're seeing so far. Your question sort of assumed a softening of the travel business overall. Let's talk about how much and to what extent. Our goal always is to gain share. Whether the market goes up or the market goes down, I can't control demand. I can't control economies. What I can control is how well we can provide value to the travelers and to the suppliers. And as long as we continue to do that, as long as we continue to provide a reason that people should come to us as a traveler or use us as a way to distribute somebody's travel suppliers, we'll continue to gain. And we've seen this in the long run here and I expect to continue to see it in the long run going forward. I can't really give more than that right now. Justin, so two separate questions. One, just going back to the general sense of the travel market. And we talk about this a lot over many, many, many calls about how much we believe that the travel market is best influenced by GDP and that in the long run, GDP goes up, more people travel, more people couldn't travel, get wealthy enough that they can travel, that's a tailwind for us. And we talk about other things. You mentioned the 3% to 5%. I mean, lots of people can come up with whatever way you want in terms of global, what's global GDP? What's it going to do to travel? Numbers aren't that different or some are probably in that neighborhood, then how much additional can we get out of increasing share because we provide a good service. And then, of course, there are the other tailwinds of the off-line to the online, another one that's a point in our favor. All these things together blew the -- the growth algorithm that we've talked about in the past is totally intact. There's going to be volatility, there's going to be variations, there's going to be events are going to happen globally, macro events that happen that can influence a quarter or a week or a day. But in the long run, we just continue to build what we've been trying to build for a long time which is a better service and that's how we do it. And one of the things we've been building and we've been working hard on and I've talked about it for a number of years, how important it is for us to build an alternative accommodations business that will rival anybody's. And we admitted that it was taking us time to build it. We started from behind. Another company may have had a bigger head start on us and building it bigger. We think we've done a really good job of catching up. I love the last call we did a few months ago when we came out and we talked about it, our homes business, our homes business, more than 2/3 of the biggest player in the industry. In that last quarter, we said how we had grown faster, 11 of the last 12 quarters. Now, I don't know if our 12% is going to win or not this time, I don't know. I'm pleased with that growth rate, given the size of the business. And how are we doing it? We're doing it by doing what we do with all things is provide a reason, I said this just to Mark earlier, is that continue to build out a product that gives a person a reason to come and use it. Now I don't really care whether the customer uses a home, or a hotel, or a villa or an igloo. I don't care. I care they get what they want. That's the important thing. And then come back. In terms of the profitability of one versus the other, we can go into that and talk about it but it's not really relevant. Because what's relevant is making sure that they use what they want. We don't try and steer them. We're trying to just make sure they have the best tools to choose what they need in the long run. That's the way we'll win and create a great business. Right. Sure. So the booking window is an interesting thing and we saw it expanding, expanding, expanding and at some point it has to stop, right? I mean, eventually, you can't keep getting bigger and bigger. One of the things I was wondering was why. Why was it expanding? Was it expanding because of inflation and people trying to book early to get that price locked up, afraid that was going to be more expensive down the road. And then now maybe they're thinking well, maybe rates aren't going to keep on increasing, so I can wait. Maybe I'll get a lower price later. I don't know and I haven't done any data to analyze and come up with what the reason is. The fact is, window gets bigger and the window gets smaller. That, of course, influences any particular quarter but in the long run, it all averages out. So I'm not going to worry too much about that. What we do make sure though is make sure that we're spending the right amount of marketing money to try and get the right conversion, do it the right ROI and that's what we continue to do and we're very careful with that. But again, another thing, just like the economies, I can't control what people are going to decide when they want to book. In regard to the tech thing, the tech issues, if you assume you're talking about the horrific events that disrupted travel throughout the world but particularly hit some of our supplier partners significantly. Delta, horrific event and I saw the CEO's interview on Squawk Box and read about what they're planning to do. It's a problem when you have critical infrastructure breaks down and then disrupts millions and millions of people's lives. That's really unfortunate. And hopefully, it won't happen again. Hopefully, people test their products before they put them out into the market. And hopefully, there are backups. Things happen but in travel, we know happens a lot. Certainly, weather happens an awful lot. This is something though that wasn't weather which you can't control, this was making sure that your infrastructure works and will be interesting how that lawsuit turns out. I will point out, it didn't affect us very much though. So we're very pleased about that. So the first more generic question about goods versus services and I think your question, I'm trying to narrow it down to, I think what we're really talking about is we saw a change in people's behavior where they seem to value services significantly more than good which, of course, helps someone like us. And I think the question is, is this a permanent change or appears to go back to a balance that they had a few years ago, maybe pre-pandemic. And I think that in the end, again, this is one of those things that I believe but I don't have proof of is that as people get wealthier, you end up spending more money on services. And it ends up a lot because people generally have one home, you got one couch. You don't keep buying more and more but as your wealth increases, you want to do things, you want to enjoy things. And we see that happening. There's also -- there could be something of the Instagram effect where -- and this is a human nature that you want to show off to your friend, to your friends, all the great things you're doing, I think that definitely has some impact because we certainly -- certain parts of the world that people never used to travel to, now they are being overrun and I think that is the Instagram effect there. So that's all good for our business. I don't know how much further it will go, though, because you need to buy homes and you need to buy couches, et cetera. And I don't see that as a big swing but I'm not concerned that it's going to flip back and we're going to end up with lower; that's one. In terms of the marketing, let's talk a couple of these. I just want to repeat this point I made earlier about. One of the things that we -- I'm happy to see is seeing us making some progress in using social. We have a long problem getting that to work for us for many, many years, just didn't seem to work. But now we're seeing, okay, starting to work, getting some good ROIs. Putting more money into it like that and I think they will continue doing that. Another thing we saw that we don't talk a lot about it, I won't get too specific but we saw ourselves using money that we thought was producing a good ROI and we turned out, it really wasn't. And we shut some of these things down. I won't go into exactly what they were. And we said, that's really not hurting us. We said, \"Well, that's great.\" And that's something that over last year or so that we saw some of the benefit in terms of our marketing leverage is coming from that. So, two good things and I'll let Ewout anything else to say about marketing there. Yes. Sorry about that. Thinking of the answer. I'm going to let Ewout handle the ad opportunity. I'll talk about our loyalty program, Genius which is the Booking.com program which we talked a little bit about in our prepared remarks. We really haven't talked about it much in terms of numbers in the past but I was just really pleased to be able to talk about our Level 2 and Level 3 players. 30% of our active users -- active travelers are Level 2 or Level 3. And we talked about that gives us more than half of the Booking.com business which is really great. That -- and we talk about how they come back more frequently and they come back more direct. That's the point that it works. And one of the great things about it is, for the most part, we're not paying for it. Our partners are supplying almost all the benefit right now but we talk about we are also putting some benefits at a time. We're going to experiment putting more in ourselves. But it's a great thing. You think why do the suppliers do it? They do it because it gets them incremental demand. It gets them demand when they need it, when they want it. It's very flexible. We work together with them, with these partners, so they can get the demand and the reason they get the demand is because our high Genius level people, our high-spending people and they are going to come and they're going to use those services. It's really a win-win-win. Win for our travelers, win for our partners and win for us. There aren't a lot of people who are doing a program like that. So we think it does differentiate. And I'm really happy to see car rental now doing a lot more of it and we're experimenting with flights. And part of the whole vision of the connected trip the Genius program fitting right into that comes with all different types of permutations of ways to provide better benefits to travelers and use it in a way, a scientific way, a data-driven way. A way using all of our AI capabilities, all the data we have so that we can come up with the best solutions for both sides of the marketplace. That is where -- that's what we're driving to. And I see it happening now in some of the numbers we said, I think gives a little indication. And then, of course, there will be the other thing which is really [ph] advertising opportunities are great. And I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about that. Sure. Well, I won't give specifics but I'll confirm what you say is true, is that somebody buys two things. It's definitely going to be bigger than one thing. And also because they bought more things, as we use the science, as we use our data, as we use all the capabilities we have to come up with, what is the value for that customer? Well, how much should we spend to attract that person is going to change, obviously. And it's also the question is in terms of loyalty. We found and it does make sense, a more satisfied customer is going to come back more often. And people in the connected trip, people who use the connected trip, we do see a higher repeat rate for a connected trip person. And we see them coming direct. And the great thing about the connected trip too is that in the past, with just one vertical which was the hotel business, we were missing on customers who wanted to start with flights and now with flights, people are starting at flights and they come and they buy something else too. And also, it's the convenience factor and that goes into the whole reason why the connected trip. I've heard from people say, \"Well, what makes you different?\" And the truth is right now, we're semi-different because we don't have the full connected trip done yet, the way I want it to be. But at the end of the day, we all know how frustrating travel is. And we know how much easy it would be if there was just one place, one person who would handle everything for you, put it all together in the way that was the optimal way with all the different things you have to decide upon. And then if anything went wrong, that it would all get fixed. And now with the benefits of GenAI coming out and the progress I see being made with it, I talked to our people in customer service and what we're putting together there, I believe we will create something that truly is differentiating and that will create a reason that people will want to come to us. The more people who come to us, more opportunities we have to work with our partners to provide them opportunities to help build their businesses. Again, I'll get to use it again, I could say win-win-win again, because that's really what we're trying to achieve here. I have to admit, I don't believe we are at that level at all right now. But that, to me, is an incredible opportunity. The fact that we are performing as well as we are in terms of our overall number but we still do not have anywhere near the number or the type of home accommodations in the U.S. to be fully competitive is, well, it's a disappointment to me that is not done yet. It's an opportunity where we have all this upside still to come. And we won't be spending huge amounts of money on a subpar product. So not to fear. We're not going to do that. What we're going to do instead to spend the money that we're spending now to make sure we get the properties we need, get the things up and running the way we want the product, the way we want it to be. So nobody ever comes to our site and feels disappointed because it wasn't as good as X. That's what we're working on right now. Clearly, the numbers show that we're doing a good job in many parts of the world but the U.S. is, to me, something that is great opportunity. And for people who live in the New York area, you know if you were looking for -- I use this example all the time because I live in the New York area. If you are looking for a rental, you wanted a home in the Hamptons this summer, you came to our site. You probably said, \"Jesus, there's not a lot here compared to some other people.\" I don't want that to be. I want us to have as many, if not more and I want it to be easier for them to come. I want the trust that coming to Booking is a better way to get that summer rental. And we're going to work on that and that's good for us, an opportunity for us. But your answer is correct. We're not there yet. Ewout, why don't you take that first one and then I'll talk a little bit about the U.S. and the increase we saw in the second quarter versus the first quarter. In regards to the U.S. and trying to distinguish, is it because we did better in homes or we did better hotels or -- I really try and stay away from that a little bit. We're trying to provide a traveler with what they need and provide all the different opportunities, whenever. But I'm very happy in the second quarter, accelerated versus the first quarter for our U.S. business. That's very good, I'm pleased by doing better over the long run. But I'm not going to say it's because we did X, Y or Z. In the end, we have to do well in every single part of this business. That means we've got to provide the homes. Absolutely, I talked about that. We got to be a good partner to the hotels and provide them with the incremental demand they need, when they need it. In addition, the connected trip, we got to make sure we're getting all the inventory we can in terms of flights, to making sure we have that ground transportation. And as I always say, nobody goes on a holiday to hang out in the accommodation. They want to do stuff. So we got to make sure we get our attraction things working well and that we're putting up the right offers to the person that they want, when they want at the right time. And of course, there's all the other things, provide the insurance and tying it all together in our merchant platform which we put in our prepared remarks some of the numbers, very pleased about the increase in that. Glad to see it continuing to go up. Glad because it provides a great convenience. It makes it easier to do a lot of things in the connected trip. All working together to provide the ultimate thing which is having a better experience for the traveler and providing more opportunities for our supplier partners. Glad that we're seeing that we did better in America, I'd like to do even better in the long run. I think America, the U.S. is a great opportunity. We continue to under index there which means for me, that's a place that we can do better. Thank you. So I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, our shareholders. We greatly appreciate everyone's support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you very much and good night."

Go ahead, gentlemen. \nGlenn Fogel: Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. I am pleased to report a strong start to 2024. Our travelers booked nearly 300 million room nights across our platforms in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations and grew 9% year-over-year. First quarter revenue of $4.4 billion grew 17% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA of about $900 million increased 53% year-over-year. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA were ahead of our first quarter expectations. Finally, adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter grew 76% year-over-year, helped by improved profit levels as well as our strong capital return program, which reduced our average share count by 9% versus the first quarter last year. \n We continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand, including healthy growth for travel on the books that's scheduled to take place during our peak summer travel season, although a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable, and what is on the books today represents a modest percentage of the expected total summer bookings. \n As we look ahead to the second quarter, room night growth compared to last year will benefit from the shift in Easter timing. However, we expect that this will be offset by a less expansion of the booking window and an increased impact from the geopolitical situation in the Middle East. We believe this will result in some deceleration in room night growth versus Q1. Ewout will provide further details on our first quarter results and our thoughts about the second quarter. \n Over the last few years, we have talked quite a bit about our key strategic priorities, which include building towards our connected trip vision, expanding our merchant offering at Booking.com, developing our AI capabilities and enhancing our genius loyalty program. These initiatives may seem to be distinct efforts, but I'd like to emphasize, they actually all fit together in our ongoing effort to deliver a much better planning, booking and traveling experience for our travelers while also benefiting our supplier partners. \n By creating a much better experience for our travelers and solving more of the challenges they face when planning, booking and experiencing a trip, we believe travelers will choose to book directly and more frequently with us, resulting in increased loyalty over time. We see encouraging early proof points at Booking.com as we have grown the number of total active travelers while experiencing higher growth in repeat travelers, which speaks to the progress we are making in encouraging customers to book again with us. In addition, we are seeing increases in the average number of trips booked per traveler as well as an increasing mix of our room nights that are booked directly with us. \n On direct mix, we are pleased to see the direct booking channel continues to grow faster than room nights acquired through paid marketing channels. While we see paid marketing channels becoming a gradually smaller proportion of our business over time, we think it's important for us to remain proactive in these channels in order to bring new travelers to our platforms, so long as we're able to do so at attractive ROIs. \n We believe continuing to improve the experience for our travelers by advancing towards our connected trip vision will help to further drive these positive proof points around loyalty, frequency and direct booking behavior. I'm encouraged to see strong growth in transactions that are connected to another booking from a different travel vertical in a trip. These connected transactions increased by just over 50% year-over-year in the first quarter, though it's important to note that this growth is off of last year's small base. \n Connected transactions represented a high single-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions in Q1. It's great to see more of our travelers choosing to book connected transactions. And we believe by providing more value and a better overall experience to those travelers, they may choose to book more trips with us and have a higher likelihood of booking directly with us in the future. \n Flights is the most frequently booked vertical in a connected transaction outside of accommodations. And it is an important component of many of the trips our travelers are booking. In the first quarter, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 33% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers to Booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the rate that these customers and returning customers see the value of the other services on our platform. \n Winning a traveler's business is never easy because of the high level of competition in our industry. But we are pleased to see that by providing a better way to do it, less friction, better value, a broader selection and great customer service, we are building a customer base that is more likely to choose us. \n Outside of flights and accommodations, we are seeing strong growth from rental cars and attraction bookings that are part of a connected transaction. We believe continuing to enhance and expand the attractions vertical has the ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination and looking for something to do. And we believe that over time, travelers who experience the value we provide for in-destination services like attractions will choose to use us more in the future. \n Bringing all of these elements of travel together in a seamless booking experience and unlocking the ability of merchandise across verticals is a capability we have been building at Booking.com over the last several years. In addition to being a foundational element to our connected trip vision, our merchant offering brings many other benefits to our travelers and partners. For travelers, we provide the ability to pay in many different methods. And we can offer discounts, incentives and other merchandising opportunities. For our supplier partners, our merchant offering enables us to take fraud liability from our partners as part of the services we provide, reduces cancellation rates versus the agency model. And over time, we believe we can help to lower payment costs for our partners.\n In order to achieve the easier and more personalized experience with the connected trip, we have always envisioned AI technology playing a central role. We believe we are well positioned to leverage this technology given we have built strong teams of AI experts and gained valuable experience from using AI extensively for many years. In addition, we have proprietary data that can be used to train specific use case models or fine-tune large AI models and have the resources and scale required to help build AI-powered offerings. \n As we have discussed before, our teams continue to work hard to integrate generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Booking.com's AI Trip Planner, Priceline's generative AI travel assistant named Penny and Kayak's recent release of generative AI-powered features and tools. We will continue to learn from traveler interactions with these tools and enhance our offerings over time. \n In addition, customer service, which is a critical function that we provide to both our travelers and partners, is an area we believe will be meaningfully enhanced by AI advancements. At each of our OTA brands, our teams are actively exploring ways to leverage generative AI technology to improve self-service tools, which we believe will reduce live agent contact rates and enable us to answer traveler questions faster. When customers still need to speak with a live agent, we believe that this technology will improve our live agent efficiency by making it easier to access information and document the conversations. In sum, we believe gen AI will lower our customer service cost per transaction over time and improve the customer experience.\n Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com also plays an increasingly important role in the multiple elements of travel that we offer as we expect our travelers will be able to experience the benefits of Genius in each of our travel verticals over time. In addition, bookings in travel verticals outside of accommodations will contribute to a traveler's Genius level tier. We have seen an encouraging number of our rental car supplier partners choosing to adopt the Genius program, and we have just begun to test the program in flights and attractions. \n We are seeing success in moving more of our travelers into the higher Genius tiers of Level 2 and Level 3, which require 5 and 15 bookings in a 2-year period, respectively. We see encouraging behavior from our Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers, including higher frequency and a higher rate of direct booking than what we see for our overall business. We will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our Genius loyalty program and deliver more benefits to our travelers with more of our supplier partners electing to participate. \n While we have mostly been discussing about our traveler customers, we operate a 2-sided marketplace, and our supplier partners are equally important to us. The success of our business is built on a mutually beneficial and balanced partnership with our millions of hotels, alternative accommodations and other supplier partners around the world. \n We strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, the majority of which are small independent businesses. We believe that improving the competitiveness and profitability of our smaller partners contributes to the long-term economic health of our sector. And we continue to onboard more small independent businesses through our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com, and we are benefiting from having more listings available on our platform for travelers to choose from. \n At the end of Q1, our global alternative accommodation listings were about 7.4 million, which is about 11% higher than Q1 last year. We are focused on continuing to build on this progress by further improving the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S.\n In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong first quarter results and the continued long-term resilience of leisure travel demand. We continue our work to deliver a better offering and experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry. We are positive about our future, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years.\n I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. \nEwout Steenbergen: Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'm very excited to join the Booking Holdings team. I look forward to continuing to work with you and David in his new role and the rest of the leadership team to help drive continued future success for our investors, employees, traveler customers and supplier partners. \n I will now review our results for the first quarter and provide our thoughts for the second quarter. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found on our earnings release. We'll post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. \n Now let's move to the first quarter results. Our room nights in the first quarter grew 9%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by about 3 percentage points. The higher-than-expected room night growth was driven by a continued expansion of the booking window as well as healthy underlying demand with better-than-expected performance in Europe and less of a negative impact from the war in the Middle East than expected. \n Looking at our room night growth by region. In the first quarter, Asia was up mid-teens. Europe and the rest of the world were up high single digits. And U.S. was up low single digits. \n We are encouraged by the continued progress we are making in strengthening the direct relationships with our travelers. Over the last 4 quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid-50% range, and when we exclude our B2B business, was in the low 60% range. We have seen both these mixes increase year-over-year in each of those 4 quarters. \n We're focused on continuing to increase our direct mix going forward, which we believe will benefit from our efforts to improve the experience for our travelers, including building towards our connected trip vision. Increasing our direct mix benefits our P&L by driving higher efficiency of our marketing spend as a percentage of gross bookings while reducing the mix of bookings we source through paid marketing channels. \n In our mobile apps, the significant majority of bookings we receive are direct. And we continue to see favorable repeat direct booking behavior from consumers in our mobile apps when compared to direct bookings on desktop or mobile web. The mobile apps also allow us more opportunities to engage directly with consumers. In the first quarter, mobile app mix of about 51% was 5 percentage points higher than the first quarter of 2023. \n We continue to offer our travelers a broad selection of places to stay and are seeing an increasing mix of our room nights being booked in alternative accommodation properties. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our first quarter room night growth was 13%. And the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was 36%, which was up versus 33% in the first quarter of 2023. \n Outside of accommodations, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the first quarter increased 33%, driven by the continued growth of Booking.com's flight offering. First quarter gross bookings increased 10%, which exceeded our expectations. The 10% increase in gross bookings was approximately 2 percentage points higher than the 9% room night growth on an unrounded basis due to about a 1% higher accommodation ADRs plus about 1 point of positive impact from flight bookings. There was an immaterial impact from changes in FX on our gross bookings growth rate. \n Our ADR growth was negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, ADRs were up about 2 percentage points. Similar to comments we have made in the past, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in the length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. \n Revenue for the first quarter of $4.4 billion also exceeded our expectations, increasing 17% year-over-year. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 10.1% and improved versus the first quarter of 2023 due mostly to the Easter timing shift as well as the easier year-on-year take rate compare due to changes in the booking window last year, as mentioned on our first quarter 2023 earnings call. \n Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 6% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 3.7%, about 15 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year, helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend.\n First quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 1.6%, about 20 basis points higher than last year due in large part to a higher merchant mix. Our more fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 11%, which was below our expectation due primarily to lower G&A expense. We recognize that this fixed expense growth is elevated as we invest in the business but are fully focused on driving operating leverage from our more fixed expenses and targeting a much lower OpEx growth level in 2025. \n Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $900 million was above our expectations, largely driven by stronger-than-expected bookings as well as better-than-expected marketing efficiency. Adjusted EBITDA was up 53%, including about 20 percentage points of benefit from the shift in Easter timing. Note that we expect the first quarter will be our seasonally lowest EBITDA quarter for the year. \n Adjusted net income of over $700 million resulted in adjusted EPS of $20.39 per share, which was up 76%. Our average share count in the first quarter was 9% below the first quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $776 million in the quarter. \n Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our first quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.4 billion was up versus our fourth quarter ending balance of $13.1 billion due to the $3 billion debt issuance in the first quarter and $2.6 billion in free cash flow generated in the first quarter. This was partially offset by the $1.9 billion in capital return, including share repurchases and the dividend we initiated in the quarter as well as $315 million in additional share repurchases to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations.\n Now on to our thoughts for the second quarter. We expect second quarter room night growth to be between 4% and 6%, a deceleration from the first quarter as the first quarter benefited more from the year-over-year expansion of the booking window. We expect the booking window to be closer to the prior year in the second quarter. Additionally, the impact from the ongoing war in the Middle East was less negative than we expected in the first quarter. However, we expect a more negative impact in the second quarter given the geopolitical situation in April. \n April room night growth rate was above the high end of that range and benefited by a couple of points from Easter being in March this year versus April last year. Adjusting for Easter, April room night growth was about in line with the high end of that range. \n We expect second quarter gross bookings growth to be between 3% and 5%, slightly below room night growth due to about 3 points of negative impact from changes in FX, offset by about 1% higher constant currency accommodation ADRs plus about 1 point of positive impact from flight bookings. \n We expect second quarter revenue growth to be between 4% and 6% and for revenue growth to be impacted by about 2 points of negative impact from changes in FX. Adjusted for the changes in FX, we expect second quarter revenue growth to be in line with second quarter gross bookings growth as the negative impact from the shift in Easter timing is offset by increasing revenues associated with payments. \n We expect marketing to be a source of slight deleverage in the quarter. But if you adjust for Easter timing, we expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be neutral year-over-year. We expect our sales and other expenses to grow faster than revenue in the second quarter, driven by a higher merchant mix. We expect our more fixed OpEx to grow faster than revenue in the second quarter due primarily to faster IT expense growth as we have been investing in new tech platforms and in line with the full year guidance we provided last quarter. \n We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between about $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion, down low single digits year-over-year due to about 7 points of pressure from the shift in Easter timing and about 2 points of negative impact on growth from changes in FX. Normalizing for Easter timing and changes in FX, our expectation for second quarter adjusted EBITDA would be for mid- to high single-digit growth. \n In closing, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the healthy leisure demand environment we are seeing. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we're not updating our previous full year commentary at this time. We want to see how the next few months develop before considering any updated commentary. We continue to expect 2024 to be a strong year for the company. \n Lastly, I would like to thank all my new colleagues across the company for their hard work and dedication to make these strong first quarter results possible. And thank you for your continued commitment towards our shared vision of making it easier for everyone to experience the world. \n We'll now move to Q&A. And Kathleen, will you please open the lines? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman of TD Cowen. \nKevin Kopelman: So a quick one on the guidance. Can you talk about what changed in terms of the shape of the year that you're seeing versus what you expected on the February call? And walk us through this kind of changing booking window trends that you're seeing. And then if you could comment on whether it's giving you any concern about the back half or you see it as more of a neutral change. \nEwout Steenbergen: Kevin, this is Ewout. If you think about the second quarter guidance that we have provided to you, I think a couple of elements that you have to take in consideration. One is we are expecting a less expanded booking window in the second quarter than we have seen in the first quarter. So there has been a little bit of a pull forward of room nights from the second quarter into our first quarter results. We are expecting more of an impact from the Middle East from what we have seen so far. But in the opposite direction is that Easter is a slight benefit for the second quarter. \n There is a little bit of noise, so to say, in the results quarter-by-quarter, particularly from Easter and the booking window. But if you look at the combined first half year results that we are expecting, so the actuals in the first quarter and the guidance for the second quarter, we believe that the results are really strong and very consistent to full year guidance that we have provided.\n In terms of the comps that you are referring, actually, first quarter and second quarter comps are a bit tougher for us. And the second half of the year, the comps will become easier. So that is actually going to be a benefit during the course of 2024. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of Evercore. \nMark Stephen Mahaney: Can I try 2 questions, please? First, why do you think the ROI is higher in paid marketing channels? Is that just efficiencies you found or you find that overall performance marketing channels, platforms that are out there are just providing a better return on ad spend to their customers in general? And then secondly, could you quantify at all what percentage of total transactions now are connected? \nGlenn Fogel: So why don't I say the first part, Mark, and I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about -- I think we gave away that -- a very generic term. I'll let him repeat it. So look, we are pleased with what we're doing with our marketing programs all around everything. And you know, Mark, we've talked about this for many, many years. We view this all holistically. And we're always looking for what is the best use of the money, what's the best way to put it to work. And when we find things that work, we put more into it. When we find things that actually are not incremental and are actually duplicative, we pull it out and say, well, let's not spend the money there. \n And that's really what we've been doing. And I'm not going to get into specific things because, obviously, it's competitively -- a competitive advantage to have these things are better. But I definitely, definitely love the fact that we are producing some very nice ROIs on our marketing programs. It's really a lot of hard work by a lot of people. So I'm going to going to shout out to them because I know they've done some really good work. And Ewout, do you want to give a -- repeat what we've already said once? But go ahead. \nEwout Steenbergen: Sure. Mark, so the percentage of connected trip as a mix of total transactions at this moment is high single digits, and that is growing very rapidly. I think the way we look at it is really in combination with multiple other elements. We're seeing that we're delivering more value for our customers. Therefore, we see higher loyalty customers moving up to higher levels of Genius, more repeat customers coming to us. We can provide them more benefits over time. They're buying more from multiple verticals, and therefore, the connected trip is growing as well. \n So this is really a flying wheel that we're having here. And we're seeing all of these metrics moving in the right direction, and they are all interrelated. So we're actually really encouraged by the total pattern of what we're seeing in terms of the added value we deliver to the customer and how it is being recognized by those travelers. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. \nJustin Post: I was wondering if you can give us the update of your regional mix. We get that question all the time and just how it's changed, any regions growing faster than others at this point and how it's changed maybe since pre-pandemic. And then second, the Digital Service Act in Europe has taken hold. And just wondering if you're seeing any changes in performance marketing channels around that or any disruptions or any opportunities. \nGlenn Fogel: Thanks, Justin. I kind of missed the second part. Let me start with the first part, and then let Ewout pick it up on the other. So regional mix. And one of the things that we've been talking about for some years because of the pandemic. The issue has been depending on when the pandemic was in its worst parts and then people coming out of it, definitely impacted how we're doing different regional ways. So as we talked in the last year's calls -- calls last year, we talked about how Asia had been behind in coming out, but of course, we're getting a good comp because they were farther behind. And now we're still benefiting from some of that. The U.S., if you recall, came out first. So of course, we had a harder comp, so to speak, when we're looking last year. \n But one of the things I've said, though, in terms of regional mix and one of the things, as you know, we are very strong in Europe. You also know that I have prioritized that we should be better in the U.S. And that is something we have been spending money, time, energy. And I'm really pleased, I've mentioned a couple of times in our previous calls, how well we have performed in the U.S. going back to pre-pandemic numbers. And it's just wonderful to see that the effort that we've put to work is actually producing results. We are going to continue to put priority in the U.S. I said that. \n And one of the areas where I think we've done extremely well, in our alternative accommodations. As you know, we have a very strong alternative accommodation on a global basis, but I've also talked in the past about us being a little bit further behind in the U.S. in alternative accommodations, particularly in types of properties that I think will be helpful in the U.S. And we are making good progress, and we're improving the product. And it's giving you the reason that people have supply, the people who own the homes are willing to come now and put them onto our platform, too. \n And you've seen some of our marketing, where we've been mentioning more about the alternative accommodations. All those things together are things the reason I believe we have a great opportunity to continue to increase our share in the U.S. and so I'm looking forward to. Ewout, I'll let you pick the rest because I didn't catch the second part. \nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. And quickly to give a couple of numbers around the regional mix. Europe, high single-digit growth in the first quarter, that was above our expectations. Very important that we see even Europe continue to do better than our own internal expectations. Asia, mid-teens growth, particularly very strong, China, Japan, Korea, India and Indonesia. And then U.S. at low single-digit growth, as Glenn already mentioned, but we believe that we have done better than the market in the first quarter with our U.S. growth and are on great trajectory and have many additional opportunities to grow faster in the future in the U.S. \n With respect to your second question regarding the DMA changes, actually, if we look at the higher ROIs for our paid channels and the marketing leverage that we're seeing in the first quarter, that is all coming from our own actions, from the improvements we're making, the continuous optimization of our paid marketing approach as well as the growth of direct channels. We don't see really an impact from the Google DMA changes. And I would say that is more neutral for us as a total effect. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. \nDouglas Anmuth: Glenn, just hoping you could perhaps quantify anything on Genius frequency or bookings versus nonmembers? And maybe you can just help us understand what you see in the path of customers as they move into upper Genius loyalty tiers. And then Ewout, just a follow-up on your U.S. comments from a few minutes ago, the low single-digit room night growth above market. Is there anything to point to in that region in particular relative to the faster growth you've seen elsewhere? \nGlenn Fogel: Doug, we don't give away numbers in our Genius membership. We don't talk about how many are in different tiers. I can say, though, how pleased I am and how the whole program continues to grow. And that's why we're continuing to expand, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks about we are now testing additional verticals, flights, attractions. The idea is that to give more value to the traveler, but it also provides a great opportunity for our supplier partners to get incremental demand when they need it. It's really a symbiotic relationship here. We're working together with our partners to both increase the value of our business but also increase the value of their business. \n Genius is not something somebody has to do. A partner decides to participate and decides how they want to participate because they believe they are actually getting true value out of that. And we're going to continue to experiment with it in terms of different ways, and sometimes we'll even put value in ourselves to make sure that we are providing the best alternative for any traveler. They should come to us and then they start to come back. \n And we talked about that in my prepared remarks about -- Ewout just mentioned it, too. As people get more value, as they get a benefit, they see the reason to come back. And then they come back not only again and again more frequently, but it's the coming back to rep. And that's the great thing. And I see this as another reason. I love Ewout using the term. I think he said flywheeling. I use flywheel. It's the same thing. It's the idea that giving more value will get people to come back more often, and that is something I see great opportunity for us. And I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about the low single digit for the U.S., any more comments he wanted to make on that. \nEwout Steenbergen: Yes, Doug, a couple of additional insights around the U.S. So what we like particularly is the sequential improvement from the fourth quarter in terms of our growth. Particularly within the growth, we saw the highest growth for alternative accommodations, which is really encouraging. If you look at U.S. bookers, more international growth than domestic growth. And then again, we really very much believe that U.S. is for us a growth market opportunity. It's fantastic with the scale that we have already today, with all the strategic expansions we're doing in multiple verticals and going more direct to connected trip, generative AI and many of the other strategic initiatives that we're having that we're actually having an opportunity to expand our position over the next few years in the U.S. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee from Mizuho Securities. Sorry, your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. \nBrian Nowak: Maybe to come back to the last discussion you are having about the U.S. Over the last sort of 10 years or so, you've had a lot of strategies in the U.S. between branded spending, paid search spending, the merchant product and now AI. I guess maybe for either of you, as you sort of think about the next couple of years, what do you sort of think the largest unlock will be to differentiate yourself to drive continued outsized growth within the online travel category in the U.S.? \nGlenn Fogel: Brian, a couple of interesting things about that question. And it's interesting when you said online, you kind of limited to online. I just had the benefit of looking at a research report by -- an industry report that talked about how much business there is that's not online yet and seeing that, saying, wow, this is still a tremendous opportunity for us. I'm speaking specifically about U.S. \n But directly to your question, so you're right. We've been doing a lot of things, and I would say they all have worked out fairly well given the numbers, the share that we have increased over the time, again, going to pre-pandemic. And I love the way we're doing, the way it keeps going. And we're going to continue to grind it out. And I've talked about it. I've used that word a number of types in previous calls, about we're grinding it out, just doing incremental changes that are getting us a little bit more. And it continues to grow on itself.\n But I think your question more is, is there going to be something down the road that is going to be transformational instead of just incremental? And I believe that is possible. I believe the things that we are doing with AI, the things that we can do with technology, the way we can do it, so it really is different. And I think I hear your question a little bit of is there enough differentiation between us and our competitors. And I believe over time, we will be doing that. And I believe the things that we can build will make it different. And I talk about how -- the frustration that travelers have nowadays. \n So even though it's become so much better than it used to be, it's still not good enough. And I believe the use of AI, particularly gen AI, and what I'm seeing through, I'm seeing testing and things that are being done, I believe that over the next few years, it will become much better because of these technological advancements. Our job is to make sure we get it out fast, and we are able to provide it to both sides of the marketplace, to our supplier partners and our travelers, such that they see the value and they continue to come back. And then we begin. I love it. I'm going to be using flywheeling from now on. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Lee of Mizuho Securities. \nJames Lee: Two over here. Can you guys comment about ADR by region and kind of what you're seeing among different markets that you're operating? And also, can you update us on ADR expectations for 2024? Maybe any changes from your prior expectation. I guess lastly, any trends that you see in terms of summer travel season, I guess, especially in Europe? How does that compare to last year? \nGlenn Fogel: ADR by regions, James, in the first quarter, what we have seen is ADRs were up in Europe and were flat in North America and in Asia. So therefore, on a constant currency basis, 1% overall growth in ADRs as we have reported today. \nEwout Steenbergen: And in terms of summer, as I said earlier, I said that we have a healthy growth for travel on the books that's scheduled to take place during the peak summer. And that's where we're feeling that -- why I'm feeling pleased about the summer. I'm not going to quantify it though. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju of UBS. \nStephen Ju: So I was wondering if there is anything you can share about how the folks who have access to Trip Planner might be behaving. It seems like there's a lot of potential application here because if they're doing research, then there's top-of-funnel implications. And then you could theoretically recommend other pieces of the trip as well. So this could theoretically drive greater connected trip activity. So just wondering. This has been out for a little less than a year. So I'm just wondering what you guys are seeing so far. \nGlenn Fogel: Yes. So it's low numbers of people who are using in such, and we're continuing to develop and learn all the time the interactions to see how people are using it. So it's a very small number of people compared to the number of people who use our services, but we are continuing to advance it. \n And I agree with you. This has tremendous potential down the road. And I think a lot of people believe that, too. In fact, it's very hard to read any article about generative AI and not have in the first paragraph the use case of travel. It's always right there because we all see how complex the number of permutations, trying to understand what is the best way to do it. And using gen AI to simplify it, it's really something that I believe will make a huge difference, albeit it's going to take time. You're not going to see tremendous changes over the next couple of quarters. \n But I do believe, over time, this will create a much better way for people to do their planning, their booking, executing and helping them when they are in destination, which is a really important thing because nobody goes on travel so they can sit it in the hotel. They want to do stuff. And we want to be able to provide that, too, and bring, as I said, about all the elements we've talked about, all the initiatives into one holistic system that enable it to be a better experience for our traveler customers. I believe that just has tremendous opportunity for us. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz of Deutsche Bank. \nLee Horowitz: Great. Two if I could. Ewout, there remains sort of a robust debate on sort of what the structural growth algorithm is for online travel at this point. I guess in your early experience of booking, what strikes you as perhaps the most compelling area that you could put $1 of investment to work in order to drive faster revenue growth for longer that maybe comes in above the investor expectations? And then maybe one on fixed OpEx. Obviously, your fixed OpEx base is up materially relative to '19, particularly when you compare it to bookings growth relative to '19. So I guess maybe what has shifted in the business that is perhaps maybe a bit more capital intensive at this point or necessitating sort of greater headcount to sort of accomplish the goals that you guys want? \nEwout Steenbergen: Yes. Thanks, Lee. So first, your question about structural growth. So I am really super positive about the outlook for the company. Why? This is, of course, a phenomenal company, super high quality, very successful. And I very much believe that we will be able to grow in the future faster than GDP. Shift of offline to online bookings. I think overall, also consumers that will spend more on experiences than on material goods.\n And then a number of areas that I believe actually, in my view, now being 6 weeks here in the position that are really underestimated for the company. So first, let me talk about direct. I think this is a company now that is -- completely has a complete game changer with respect to the share of direct. We're not only dependent on pay channels anymore. And that is now in the low 60% range for the B2C business. It's really important, and we are keeping those customers with us, and we have talked about it now before previous questions of really adding more value and more of those travelers coming back to the app, booking direct to us and the benefit we are having with that. \n The other is the opportunity we have with respect to alternative accommodations. I think, again, this is completely not well understood and underestimated. We are actually, in terms of size, 2/3 of the largest player in this space, and we are growing faster in most of the last 8 quarters. And we still have a lot of opportunity to further develop our offering. But the fact that we are combining traditional accommodations and alternative accommodations on a platform and having travelers really being able to go from one to the other -- sometimes they go in and want to book one type of accommodation, and they end up booking a completely different type of accommodation. \n And the last is gen AI. Glenn was just commenting on this. I have to say, I think the strategic benefit we have in terms of our capital investments we can make as well as the quality of the data because in generative AI, it's not so much about the language models. The data that go into the language models is strategically probably the biggest differentiator. And we have really advantage with respect to the data because of all the different ways that we touch travelers and partners and other stakeholders in the travel industry. So therefore, I'm really very positive and optimistic about the structural growth opportunities for the company over the next couple of years. \n Quickly about fixed OpEx. I think that has to do with a couple of strategic expansions that the company has done, multiple verticals, moving in payments. But that is actually linked to your previous question. That will help drive future growth for the company. So that's actually a good thing. But as we have said, we are targeting to lower the growth of fixed OpEx from 2025 onwards. And you will see more operating leverage from that over the next few years. So this year, we'll still have some end finalization of some of the investments, for example, about some of the tech platforms. But then for next year, you will see more operating leverage coming in from all of those investments we have been making. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies. \nJohn Colantuoni: Just wanted to ask about underlying room night trends. just talk about in the first quarter, the size of some of the transitory impacts that you called out like Easter shift, geopolitical disruption and the booking window and sort of how that shakes out to how you think about underlying trends in the business. \n And second, on the attractions offering, can you talk about the investments that you've made so far and how your supply is today versus where you need it to be over time to sort of open up the full potential of that opportunity? And our understanding is that attractions are often booked closer to the trip date, which requires getting the traveler back to the app. Talk about how you're sort of looking to drive a solution to that dynamic and how the connected trip offering could help drive that behavior over time. \nEwout Steenbergen: With respect to your first question, room nights dynamics in the first quarter. So positives here compared to our original guidance for the first quarter were the fact that the booking window was expanding and that we're able to pull some room night bookings from the second quarter into the first quarter, healthy demand in Europe, and Europe was stronger than we anticipated, as we mentioned before, and less of an impact from the Middle East. And you saw excluding the Middle East impact, actually, the result was exactly the same. So there was no material impact from the Middle East. Easter was a negative, a small negative. But that was, of course, anticipated in the guidance that we provided before. \nGlenn Fogel: So on attractions -- and it's a good question to ask because we haven't talked about it a lot in the past. Attractions is mostly supplied through third parties. So we have arrangements with companies like Viator, or a Klook or Musement. And we get the supply that way. In addition -- and we don't talk about this much at all either. We also have FareHarbor, which if you may recall, we acquired that. Think of it as the OpenTable for small- and medium-sized attractions because it's a good loop into those attractions. \n We have priorities though. We can be anything, but we can't be everything, and we definitely can't be everything all at once. So the priorities have been to get the flight stuff up, get that one. It's the biggest thing, get that going well first. And then we have making sure that we have the ground transportation to make sure all that stuff is -- now our people have attraction. They also want to have a lot of emphasis, too, and they are doing a great job building that, and we've talked a little bit about that. \n And that's going to come in as part of the overall connected trip because as you point out, people don't generally book their attractions far, far in advance. In fact, a lot of them want to book it when they're actually in destination, and that's why I love the fact of the increased amount of use of our app because that's like having your travel agent in your pocket and be able to -- we're able to send them great offers, great ideas where they go right to it, checks on the app and can they get something better. \n And that's why we're bringing that into our Genius program for people to have an attraction business and want to get that incremental demand. We can push something to a customer who's in destination and give us on -- bring them to that particular supplier. All over, it's a tremendous opportunity down the road. We have yet to even really scratch the possibilities with that, and that's just another reason why I see just tremendous opportunity for us as we continue to roll on. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi. \nRonald Josey: I want to ask maybe a follow-up on alternative accommodations here just given how much faster overall room nights are growing. And Ewout, you talked a little bit about this as well as Glenn, but I wanted to hear more about the supply side, the 7.4 million properties on the site. Are these higher quality than maybe what you've seen in the past? Are they differentiated from other platforms given -- that are available out there? And Ewout, you made a good mention earlier just that with Booking offering both alternative accommodations and traditional, that's an advantage. I'd love to hear your thoughts on what you're seeing from a consumer perspective, those that book both and then the mix between that going forward between those 2 bookings. \nEwout Steenbergen: So let me first take the second part of the question in terms of alternative and traditional accommodations. We're actually not so much separating in our thinking one versus the other because we believe that our unique proposition is that we're putting both in the same way on our platforms because it is an artificial separation as we are seeing many consumers are looking for both. They want to alternate -- look at different alternatives. They want to compare. And often, if they start to look for a traditional hotel, they maybe end up with an apartment they want to rent as an alternative accommodation or the other way around. So actually, the way we look at it is we think it's actually really strong to bring all of these propositions together and have a really a combined offering to our traveler customers. \nGlenn Fogel: In terms of quality -- and I'd like to think that the inventory we have is high quality, obviously comes at different price points. It's a complete range. And you may not be surprised that lower-priced things may not be as luxurious the higher-priced things. And I think we cover the gamut, but we don't have enough of certain types in certain areas. And I've talked about this before. We're entering close to the summer, and I look at -- I live in the New York metropolitan area. And I'm looking, do we have enough of these high-end homes in the Hamptons? And I don't think we do. If I look at some of our competitors, I see more. \n I look at that as opportunity for us, though, because we're doing so well. Yes, we don't have all the different types of accommodations and the quantity that I want to have in that. It's great that we are as big as we are, but I absolutely see no reason we shouldn't be significantly bigger throughout every geographical area. Look, our base was Europe. So we are very, very competitive. We have great inventory, all types there. But I've talked about the U.S., and that's an area we continue to do more work. And I mentioned earlier, I see us making great progress there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly of Oppenheimer. \nJed Kelly: Great. Just following up on that last point, Glenn. How do you think about getting more of that single unit inventory? Is it connecting more with property managers, the PMS systems? And then my second question is, just how should we view the big events in Europe this year, this summer in travel, particularly around the Olympics impacting demand or how people would travel? \nGlenn Fogel: Sure. So yes, and we definitely have -- you're not surprised of the fact that it's easier to get more inventory when you go to some of the managers who have significant number of the inventory you're looking for. And those multi-property managers are the place where we definitely assume more business. And we have not, until very recently, really spent a lot of time trying to do it in the low -- trying to go for individuals and trying to bring them in, too. \n There's no doubt, though, over time, we have to make sure to make an effort to everybody. And that means being sure that we are providing a platform that a supplier really likes to use. And I saw something recent. Just to give you an example, turns out that until fairly recently, it was hard for some of our big managers to be able to reconcile the payments with individual properties. And we improved that significantly recently. And that's the reason, it was, okay, now I'll do that. And I can go through a whole bunch of different individual things that, well, by themselves may not be so big. As a whole, they end up saying, yes, I will now be more than happy to get incremental demand from Booking.com because I find it easy and helpful. \n If somebody is going to make business to make money, you definitely never want to have your property empty. That's 0 revenue. You're never going to get back. That inventory expires. So that's why people are always looking to try and get more demand. As long as we provide them with demand and we provide them with a platform that they find easy and helpful, they will come to us. \n In regards to the summer and things like Paris and the Olympics, stuff like that, it's always a mystery what's going to happen with the Olympics. So I've been here now 24 years. So I've been through a whole bunch of Olympics and thought it was going to be -- this is what's going to happen and then something else happens. Here's the big point. Let's not concentrate too much on one individual event to last for a couple of weeks. \n I continue to say the important way to view value in this company in the long run. What have we done? What have we done over the last 24 years here? Continue to increase the value, bring in more customers and more suppliers and continue to produce more cash flow for our investors. That's the way we've done in the past and what we did in the past. And as far as how the Paris Olympics go, I really -- I can guess, but my guess is as good as yours. And I don't think that's something that I'd spend a lot of time worrying about. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom White from D.A. Davidson. \nThomas White: Just one. I wanted to follow up on some of the prior questions on the U.S. market. I was hoping you could kind of comment on maybe the relative unit economics of your U.S. accommodations business today versus in Europe. Obviously, the Booking.com brand here is well known but less well known than in Europe. And so maybe there's like a heavier kind of marketing load per room night here. But the ADRs here are nice and high. But then again, maybe the take rates are lower. So I'm just kind of curious directionally how accommodation kind of unit economics in the U.S. stack up versus Europe at the moment and maybe where you kind of see that going over the next few years. \nGlenn Fogel: We don't disclose much more and giving you these regional growth rates. We don't go any further than that in terms of detail. And I don't think we'll be starting that right now. I understand your reason for asking, but for reason of competitiveness and such, we're not going to break this down any further than that. \nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Glenn Fogel for closing remarks. \nGlenn Fogel: Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, our shareholders, and I especially want to thank Ewout for joining the team. Ewout, thank you very much. We greatly appreciate everyone's support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you, and good night. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ewout Steenbergen",
            "content": "Thank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'm very excited to join the Booking Holdings team. I look forward to continuing to work with you and David in his new role and the rest of the leadership team to help drive continued future success for our investors, employees, traveler customers and supplier partners. \n I will now review our results for the first quarter and provide our thoughts for the second quarter. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found on our earnings release. We'll post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. \n Now let's move to the first quarter results. Our room nights in the first quarter grew 9%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by about 3 percentage points. The higher-than-expected room night growth was driven by a continued expansion of the booking window as well as healthy underlying demand with better-than-expected performance in Europe and less of a negative impact from the war in the Middle East than expected. \n Looking at our room night growth by region. In the first quarter, Asia was up mid-teens. Europe and the rest of the world were up high single digits. And U.S. was up low single digits. \n We are encouraged by the continued progress we are making in strengthening the direct relationships with our travelers. Over the last 4 quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid-50% range, and when we exclude our B2B business, was in the low 60% range. We have seen both these mixes increase year-over-year in each of those 4 quarters. \n We're focused on continuing to increase our direct mix going forward, which we believe will benefit from our efforts to improve the experience for our travelers, including building towards our connected trip vision. Increasing our direct mix benefits our P&L by driving higher efficiency of our marketing spend as a percentage of gross bookings while reducing the mix of bookings we source through paid marketing channels. \n In our mobile apps, the significant majority of bookings we receive are direct. And we continue to see favorable repeat direct booking behavior from consumers in our mobile apps when compared to direct bookings on desktop or mobile web. The mobile apps also allow us more opportunities to engage directly with consumers. In the first quarter, mobile app mix of about 51% was 5 percentage points higher than the first quarter of 2023. \n We continue to offer our travelers a broad selection of places to stay and are seeing an increasing mix of our room nights being booked in alternative accommodation properties. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our first quarter room night growth was 13%. And the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was 36%, which was up versus 33% in the first quarter of 2023. \n Outside of accommodations, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the first quarter increased 33%, driven by the continued growth of Booking.com's flight offering. First quarter gross bookings increased 10%, which exceeded our expectations. The 10% increase in gross bookings was approximately 2 percentage points higher than the 9% room night growth on an unrounded basis due to about a 1% higher accommodation ADRs plus about 1 point of positive impact from flight bookings. There was an immaterial impact from changes in FX on our gross bookings growth rate. \n Our ADR growth was negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, ADRs were up about 2 percentage points. Similar to comments we have made in the past, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in the length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely. \n Revenue for the first quarter of $4.4 billion also exceeded our expectations, increasing 17% year-over-year. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 10.1% and improved versus the first quarter of 2023 due mostly to the Easter timing shift as well as the easier year-on-year take rate compare due to changes in the booking window last year, as mentioned on our first quarter 2023 earnings call. \n Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 6% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 3.7%, about 15 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year, helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend.\n First quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 1.6%, about 20 basis points higher than last year due in large part to a higher merchant mix. Our more fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 11%, which was below our expectation due primarily to lower G&A expense. We recognize that this fixed expense growth is elevated as we invest in the business but are fully focused on driving operating leverage from our more fixed expenses and targeting a much lower OpEx growth level in 2025. \n Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $900 million was above our expectations, largely driven by stronger-than-expected bookings as well as better-than-expected marketing efficiency. Adjusted EBITDA was up 53%, including about 20 percentage points of benefit from the shift in Easter timing. Note that we expect the first quarter will be our seasonally lowest EBITDA quarter for the year. \n Adjusted net income of over $700 million resulted in adjusted EPS of $20.39 per share, which was up 76%. Our average share count in the first quarter was 9% below the first quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $776 million in the quarter. \n Now on to our cash and liquidity position. Our first quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.4 billion was up versus our fourth quarter ending balance of $13.1 billion due to the $3 billion debt issuance in the first quarter and $2.6 billion in free cash flow generated in the first quarter. This was partially offset by the $1.9 billion in capital return, including share repurchases and the dividend we initiated in the quarter as well as $315 million in additional share repurchases to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations.\n Now on to our thoughts for the second quarter. We expect second quarter room night growth to be between 4% and 6%, a deceleration from the first quarter as the first quarter benefited more from the year-over-year expansion of the booking window. We expect the booking window to be closer to the prior year in the second quarter. Additionally, the impact from the ongoing war in the Middle East was less negative than we expected in the first quarter. However, we expect a more negative impact in the second quarter given the geopolitical situation in April. \n April room night growth rate was above the high end of that range and benefited by a couple of points from Easter being in March this year versus April last year. Adjusting for Easter, April room night growth was about in line with the high end of that range. \n We expect second quarter gross bookings growth to be between 3% and 5%, slightly below room night growth due to about 3 points of negative impact from changes in FX, offset by about 1% higher constant currency accommodation ADRs plus about 1 point of positive impact from flight bookings. \n We expect second quarter revenue growth to be between 4% and 6% and for revenue growth to be impacted by about 2 points of negative impact from changes in FX. Adjusted for the changes in FX, we expect second quarter revenue growth to be in line with second quarter gross bookings growth as the negative impact from the shift in Easter timing is offset by increasing revenues associated with payments. \n We expect marketing to be a source of slight deleverage in the quarter. But if you adjust for Easter timing, we expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be neutral year-over-year. We expect our sales and other expenses to grow faster than revenue in the second quarter, driven by a higher merchant mix. We expect our more fixed OpEx to grow faster than revenue in the second quarter due primarily to faster IT expense growth as we have been investing in new tech platforms and in line with the full year guidance we provided last quarter. \n We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between about $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion, down low single digits year-over-year due to about 7 points of pressure from the shift in Easter timing and about 2 points of negative impact on growth from changes in FX. Normalizing for Easter timing and changes in FX, our expectation for second quarter adjusted EBITDA would be for mid- to high single-digit growth. \n In closing, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the healthy leisure demand environment we are seeing. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we're not updating our previous full year commentary at this time. We want to see how the next few months develop before considering any updated commentary. We continue to expect 2024 to be a strong year for the company. \n Lastly, I would like to thank all my new colleagues across the company for their hard work and dedication to make these strong first quarter results possible. And thank you for your continued commitment towards our shared vision of making it easier for everyone to experience the world. \n We'll now move to Q&A. And Kathleen, will you please open the lines? Kevin, this is Ewout. If you think about the second quarter guidance that we have provided to you, I think a couple of elements that you have to take in consideration. One is we are expecting a less expanded booking window in the second quarter than we have seen in the first quarter. So there has been a little bit of a pull forward of room nights from the second quarter into our first quarter results. We are expecting more of an impact from the Middle East from what we have seen so far. But in the opposite direction is that Easter is a slight benefit for the second quarter. \n There is a little bit of noise, so to say, in the results quarter-by-quarter, particularly from Easter and the booking window. But if you look at the combined first half year results that we are expecting, so the actuals in the first quarter and the guidance for the second quarter, we believe that the results are really strong and very consistent to full year guidance that we have provided.\n In terms of the comps that you are referring, actually, first quarter and second quarter comps are a bit tougher for us. And the second half of the year, the comps will become easier. So that is actually going to be a benefit during the course of 2024. Sure. Mark, so the percentage of connected trip as a mix of total transactions at this moment is high single digits, and that is growing very rapidly. I think the way we look at it is really in combination with multiple other elements. We're seeing that we're delivering more value for our customers. Therefore, we see higher loyalty customers moving up to higher levels of Genius, more repeat customers coming to us. We can provide them more benefits over time. They're buying more from multiple verticals, and therefore, the connected trip is growing as well. \n So this is really a flying wheel that we're having here. And we're seeing all of these metrics moving in the right direction, and they are all interrelated. So we're actually really encouraged by the total pattern of what we're seeing in terms of the added value we deliver to the customer and how it is being recognized by those travelers. Yes. And quickly to give a couple of numbers around the regional mix. Europe, high single-digit growth in the first quarter, that was above our expectations. Very important that we see even Europe continue to do better than our own internal expectations. Asia, mid-teens growth, particularly very strong, China, Japan, Korea, India and Indonesia. And then U.S. at low single-digit growth, as Glenn already mentioned, but we believe that we have done better than the market in the first quarter with our U.S. growth and are on great trajectory and have many additional opportunities to grow faster in the future in the U.S. \n With respect to your second question regarding the DMA changes, actually, if we look at the higher ROIs for our paid channels and the marketing leverage that we're seeing in the first quarter, that is all coming from our own actions, from the improvements we're making, the continuous optimization of our paid marketing approach as well as the growth of direct channels. We don't see really an impact from the Google DMA changes. And I would say that is more neutral for us as a total effect. Yes, Doug, a couple of additional insights around the U.S. So what we like particularly is the sequential improvement from the fourth quarter in terms of our growth. Particularly within the growth, we saw the highest growth for alternative accommodations, which is really encouraging. If you look at U.S. bookers, more international growth than domestic growth. And then again, we really very much believe that U.S. is for us a growth market opportunity. It's fantastic with the scale that we have already today, with all the strategic expansions we're doing in multiple verticals and going more direct to connected trip, generative AI and many of the other strategic initiatives that we're having that we're actually having an opportunity to expand our position over the next few years in the U.S. And in terms of summer, as I said earlier, I said that we have a healthy growth for travel on the books that's scheduled to take place during the peak summer. And that's where we're feeling that -- why I'm feeling pleased about the summer. I'm not going to quantify it though. Yes. Thanks, Lee. So first, your question about structural growth. So I am really super positive about the outlook for the company. Why? This is, of course, a phenomenal company, super high quality, very successful. And I very much believe that we will be able to grow in the future faster than GDP. Shift of offline to online bookings. I think overall, also consumers that will spend more on experiences than on material goods.\n And then a number of areas that I believe actually, in my view, now being 6 weeks here in the position that are really underestimated for the company. So first, let me talk about direct. I think this is a company now that is -- completely has a complete game changer with respect to the share of direct. We're not only dependent on pay channels anymore. And that is now in the low 60% range for the B2C business. It's really important, and we are keeping those customers with us, and we have talked about it now before previous questions of really adding more value and more of those travelers coming back to the app, booking direct to us and the benefit we are having with that. \n The other is the opportunity we have with respect to alternative accommodations. I think, again, this is completely not well understood and underestimated. We are actually, in terms of size, 2/3 of the largest player in this space, and we are growing faster in most of the last 8 quarters. And we still have a lot of opportunity to further develop our offering. But the fact that we are combining traditional accommodations and alternative accommodations on a platform and having travelers really being able to go from one to the other -- sometimes they go in and want to book one type of accommodation, and they end up booking a completely different type of accommodation. \n And the last is gen AI. Glenn was just commenting on this. I have to say, I think the strategic benefit we have in terms of our capital investments we can make as well as the quality of the data because in generative AI, it's not so much about the language models. The data that go into the language models is strategically probably the biggest differentiator. And we have really advantage with respect to the data because of all the different ways that we touch travelers and partners and other stakeholders in the travel industry. So therefore, I'm really very positive and optimistic about the structural growth opportunities for the company over the next couple of years. \n Quickly about fixed OpEx. I think that has to do with a couple of strategic expansions that the company has done, multiple verticals, moving in payments. But that is actually linked to your previous question. That will help drive future growth for the company. So that's actually a good thing. But as we have said, we are targeting to lower the growth of fixed OpEx from 2025 onwards. And you will see more operating leverage from that over the next few years. So this year, we'll still have some end finalization of some of the investments, for example, about some of the tech platforms. But then for next year, you will see more operating leverage coming in from all of those investments we have been making. With respect to your first question, room nights dynamics in the first quarter. So positives here compared to our original guidance for the first quarter were the fact that the booking window was expanding and that we're able to pull some room night bookings from the second quarter into the first quarter, healthy demand in Europe, and Europe was stronger than we anticipated, as we mentioned before, and less of an impact from the Middle East. And you saw excluding the Middle East impact, actually, the result was exactly the same. So there was no material impact from the Middle East. Easter was a negative, a small negative. But that was, of course, anticipated in the guidance that we provided before. So let me first take the second part of the question in terms of alternative and traditional accommodations. We're actually not so much separating in our thinking one versus the other because we believe that our unique proposition is that we're putting both in the same way on our platforms because it is an artificial separation as we are seeing many consumers are looking for both. They want to alternate -- look at different alternatives. They want to compare. And often, if they start to look for a traditional hotel, they maybe end up with an apartment they want to rent as an alternative accommodation or the other way around. So actually, the way we look at it is we think it's actually really strong to bring all of these propositions together and have a really a combined offering to our traveler customers."

            "name": "Glenn Fogel",
            "content": "Thank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. I am pleased to report a strong start to 2024. Our travelers booked nearly 300 million room nights across our platforms in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations and grew 9% year-over-year. First quarter revenue of $4.4 billion grew 17% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA of about $900 million increased 53% year-over-year. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA were ahead of our first quarter expectations. Finally, adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter grew 76% year-over-year, helped by improved profit levels as well as our strong capital return program, which reduced our average share count by 9% versus the first quarter last year. \n We continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand, including healthy growth for travel on the books that's scheduled to take place during our peak summer travel season, although a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable, and what is on the books today represents a modest percentage of the expected total summer bookings. \n As we look ahead to the second quarter, room night growth compared to last year will benefit from the shift in Easter timing. However, we expect that this will be offset by a less expansion of the booking window and an increased impact from the geopolitical situation in the Middle East. We believe this will result in some deceleration in room night growth versus Q1. Ewout will provide further details on our first quarter results and our thoughts about the second quarter. \n Over the last few years, we have talked quite a bit about our key strategic priorities, which include building towards our connected trip vision, expanding our merchant offering at Booking.com, developing our AI capabilities and enhancing our genius loyalty program. These initiatives may seem to be distinct efforts, but I'd like to emphasize, they actually all fit together in our ongoing effort to deliver a much better planning, booking and traveling experience for our travelers while also benefiting our supplier partners. \n By creating a much better experience for our travelers and solving more of the challenges they face when planning, booking and experiencing a trip, we believe travelers will choose to book directly and more frequently with us, resulting in increased loyalty over time. We see encouraging early proof points at Booking.com as we have grown the number of total active travelers while experiencing higher growth in repeat travelers, which speaks to the progress we are making in encouraging customers to book again with us. In addition, we are seeing increases in the average number of trips booked per traveler as well as an increasing mix of our room nights that are booked directly with us. \n On direct mix, we are pleased to see the direct booking channel continues to grow faster than room nights acquired through paid marketing channels. While we see paid marketing channels becoming a gradually smaller proportion of our business over time, we think it's important for us to remain proactive in these channels in order to bring new travelers to our platforms, so long as we're able to do so at attractive ROIs. \n We believe continuing to improve the experience for our travelers by advancing towards our connected trip vision will help to further drive these positive proof points around loyalty, frequency and direct booking behavior. I'm encouraged to see strong growth in transactions that are connected to another booking from a different travel vertical in a trip. These connected transactions increased by just over 50% year-over-year in the first quarter, though it's important to note that this growth is off of last year's small base. \n Connected transactions represented a high single-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions in Q1. It's great to see more of our travelers choosing to book connected transactions. And we believe by providing more value and a better overall experience to those travelers, they may choose to book more trips with us and have a higher likelihood of booking directly with us in the future. \n Flights is the most frequently booked vertical in a connected transaction outside of accommodations. And it is an important component of many of the trips our travelers are booking. In the first quarter, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 33% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers to Booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the rate that these customers and returning customers see the value of the other services on our platform. \n Winning a traveler's business is never easy because of the high level of competition in our industry. But we are pleased to see that by providing a better way to do it, less friction, better value, a broader selection and great customer service, we are building a customer base that is more likely to choose us. \n Outside of flights and accommodations, we are seeing strong growth from rental cars and attraction bookings that are part of a connected transaction. We believe continuing to enhance and expand the attractions vertical has the ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination and looking for something to do. And we believe that over time, travelers who experience the value we provide for in-destination services like attractions will choose to use us more in the future. \n Bringing all of these elements of travel together in a seamless booking experience and unlocking the ability of merchandise across verticals is a capability we have been building at Booking.com over the last several years. In addition to being a foundational element to our connected trip vision, our merchant offering brings many other benefits to our travelers and partners. For travelers, we provide the ability to pay in many different methods. And we can offer discounts, incentives and other merchandising opportunities. For our supplier partners, our merchant offering enables us to take fraud liability from our partners as part of the services we provide, reduces cancellation rates versus the agency model. And over time, we believe we can help to lower payment costs for our partners.\n In order to achieve the easier and more personalized experience with the connected trip, we have always envisioned AI technology playing a central role. We believe we are well positioned to leverage this technology given we have built strong teams of AI experts and gained valuable experience from using AI extensively for many years. In addition, we have proprietary data that can be used to train specific use case models or fine-tune large AI models and have the resources and scale required to help build AI-powered offerings. \n As we have discussed before, our teams continue to work hard to integrate generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Booking.com's AI Trip Planner, Priceline's generative AI travel assistant named Penny and Kayak's recent release of generative AI-powered features and tools. We will continue to learn from traveler interactions with these tools and enhance our offerings over time. \n In addition, customer service, which is a critical function that we provide to both our travelers and partners, is an area we believe will be meaningfully enhanced by AI advancements. At each of our OTA brands, our teams are actively exploring ways to leverage generative AI technology to improve self-service tools, which we believe will reduce live agent contact rates and enable us to answer traveler questions faster. When customers still need to speak with a live agent, we believe that this technology will improve our live agent efficiency by making it easier to access information and document the conversations. In sum, we believe gen AI will lower our customer service cost per transaction over time and improve the customer experience.\n Our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com also plays an increasingly important role in the multiple elements of travel that we offer as we expect our travelers will be able to experience the benefits of Genius in each of our travel verticals over time. In addition, bookings in travel verticals outside of accommodations will contribute to a traveler's Genius level tier. We have seen an encouraging number of our rental car supplier partners choosing to adopt the Genius program, and we have just begun to test the program in flights and attractions. \n We are seeing success in moving more of our travelers into the higher Genius tiers of Level 2 and Level 3, which require 5 and 15 bookings in a 2-year period, respectively. We see encouraging behavior from our Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers, including higher frequency and a higher rate of direct booking than what we see for our overall business. We will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our Genius loyalty program and deliver more benefits to our travelers with more of our supplier partners electing to participate. \n While we have mostly been discussing about our traveler customers, we operate a 2-sided marketplace, and our supplier partners are equally important to us. The success of our business is built on a mutually beneficial and balanced partnership with our millions of hotels, alternative accommodations and other supplier partners around the world. \n We strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, the majority of which are small independent businesses. We believe that improving the competitiveness and profitability of our smaller partners contributes to the long-term economic health of our sector. And we continue to onboard more small independent businesses through our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com, and we are benefiting from having more listings available on our platform for travelers to choose from. \n At the end of Q1, our global alternative accommodation listings were about 7.4 million, which is about 11% higher than Q1 last year. We are focused on continuing to build on this progress by further improving the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S.\n In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong first quarter results and the continued long-term resilience of leisure travel demand. We continue our work to deliver a better offering and experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry. We are positive about our future, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years.\n I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. So why don't I say the first part, Mark, and I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about -- I think we gave away that -- a very generic term. I'll let him repeat it. So look, we are pleased with what we're doing with our marketing programs all around everything. And you know, Mark, we've talked about this for many, many years. We view this all holistically. And we're always looking for what is the best use of the money, what's the best way to put it to work. And when we find things that work, we put more into it. When we find things that actually are not incremental and are actually duplicative, we pull it out and say, well, let's not spend the money there. \n And that's really what we've been doing. And I'm not going to get into specific things because, obviously, it's competitively -- a competitive advantage to have these things are better. But I definitely, definitely love the fact that we are producing some very nice ROIs on our marketing programs. It's really a lot of hard work by a lot of people. So I'm going to going to shout out to them because I know they've done some really good work. And Ewout, do you want to give a -- repeat what we've already said once? But go ahead. Thanks, Justin. I kind of missed the second part. Let me start with the first part, and then let Ewout pick it up on the other. So regional mix. And one of the things that we've been talking about for some years because of the pandemic. The issue has been depending on when the pandemic was in its worst parts and then people coming out of it, definitely impacted how we're doing different regional ways. So as we talked in the last year's calls -- calls last year, we talked about how Asia had been behind in coming out, but of course, we're getting a good comp because they were farther behind. And now we're still benefiting from some of that. The U.S., if you recall, came out first. So of course, we had a harder comp, so to speak, when we're looking last year. \n But one of the things I've said, though, in terms of regional mix and one of the things, as you know, we are very strong in Europe. You also know that I have prioritized that we should be better in the U.S. And that is something we have been spending money, time, energy. And I'm really pleased, I've mentioned a couple of times in our previous calls, how well we have performed in the U.S. going back to pre-pandemic numbers. And it's just wonderful to see that the effort that we've put to work is actually producing results. We are going to continue to put priority in the U.S. I said that. \n And one of the areas where I think we've done extremely well, in our alternative accommodations. As you know, we have a very strong alternative accommodation on a global basis, but I've also talked in the past about us being a little bit further behind in the U.S. in alternative accommodations, particularly in types of properties that I think will be helpful in the U.S. And we are making good progress, and we're improving the product. And it's giving you the reason that people have supply, the people who own the homes are willing to come now and put them onto our platform, too. \n And you've seen some of our marketing, where we've been mentioning more about the alternative accommodations. All those things together are things the reason I believe we have a great opportunity to continue to increase our share in the U.S. and so I'm looking forward to. Ewout, I'll let you pick the rest because I didn't catch the second part. Doug, we don't give away numbers in our Genius membership. We don't talk about how many are in different tiers. I can say, though, how pleased I am and how the whole program continues to grow. And that's why we're continuing to expand, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks about we are now testing additional verticals, flights, attractions. The idea is that to give more value to the traveler, but it also provides a great opportunity for our supplier partners to get incremental demand when they need it. It's really a symbiotic relationship here. We're working together with our partners to both increase the value of our business but also increase the value of their business. \n Genius is not something somebody has to do. A partner decides to participate and decides how they want to participate because they believe they are actually getting true value out of that. And we're going to continue to experiment with it in terms of different ways, and sometimes we'll even put value in ourselves to make sure that we are providing the best alternative for any traveler. They should come to us and then they start to come back. \n And we talked about that in my prepared remarks about -- Ewout just mentioned it, too. As people get more value, as they get a benefit, they see the reason to come back. And then they come back not only again and again more frequently, but it's the coming back to rep. And that's the great thing. And I see this as another reason. I love Ewout using the term. I think he said flywheeling. I use flywheel. It's the same thing. It's the idea that giving more value will get people to come back more often, and that is something I see great opportunity for us. And I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about the low single digit for the U.S., any more comments he wanted to make on that. Brian, a couple of interesting things about that question. And it's interesting when you said online, you kind of limited to online. I just had the benefit of looking at a research report by -- an industry report that talked about how much business there is that's not online yet and seeing that, saying, wow, this is still a tremendous opportunity for us. I'm speaking specifically about U.S. \n But directly to your question, so you're right. We've been doing a lot of things, and I would say they all have worked out fairly well given the numbers, the share that we have increased over the time, again, going to pre-pandemic. And I love the way we're doing, the way it keeps going. And we're going to continue to grind it out. And I've talked about it. I've used that word a number of types in previous calls, about we're grinding it out, just doing incremental changes that are getting us a little bit more. And it continues to grow on itself.\n But I think your question more is, is there going to be something down the road that is going to be transformational instead of just incremental? And I believe that is possible. I believe the things that we are doing with AI, the things that we can do with technology, the way we can do it, so it really is different. And I think I hear your question a little bit of is there enough differentiation between us and our competitors. And I believe over time, we will be doing that. And I believe the things that we can build will make it different. And I talk about how -- the frustration that travelers have nowadays. \n So even though it's become so much better than it used to be, it's still not good enough. And I believe the use of AI, particularly gen AI, and what I'm seeing through, I'm seeing testing and things that are being done, I believe that over the next few years, it will become much better because of these technological advancements. Our job is to make sure we get it out fast, and we are able to provide it to both sides of the marketplace, to our supplier partners and our travelers, such that they see the value and they continue to come back. And then we begin. I love it. I'm going to be using flywheeling from now on. ADR by regions, James, in the first quarter, what we have seen is ADRs were up in Europe and were flat in North America and in Asia. So therefore, on a constant currency basis, 1% overall growth in ADRs as we have reported today. Yes. So it's low numbers of people who are using in such, and we're continuing to develop and learn all the time the interactions to see how people are using it. So it's a very small number of people compared to the number of people who use our services, but we are continuing to advance it. \n And I agree with you. This has tremendous potential down the road. And I think a lot of people believe that, too. In fact, it's very hard to read any article about generative AI and not have in the first paragraph the use case of travel. It's always right there because we all see how complex the number of permutations, trying to understand what is the best way to do it. And using gen AI to simplify it, it's really something that I believe will make a huge difference, albeit it's going to take time. You're not going to see tremendous changes over the next couple of quarters. \n But I do believe, over time, this will create a much better way for people to do their planning, their booking, executing and helping them when they are in destination, which is a really important thing because nobody goes on travel so they can sit it in the hotel. They want to do stuff. And we want to be able to provide that, too, and bring, as I said, about all the elements we've talked about, all the initiatives into one holistic system that enable it to be a better experience for our traveler customers. I believe that just has tremendous opportunity for us. So on attractions -- and it's a good question to ask because we haven't talked about it a lot in the past. Attractions is mostly supplied through third parties. So we have arrangements with companies like Viator, or a Klook or Musement. And we get the supply that way. In addition -- and we don't talk about this much at all either. We also have FareHarbor, which if you may recall, we acquired that. Think of it as the OpenTable for small- and medium-sized attractions because it's a good loop into those attractions. \n We have priorities though. We can be anything, but we can't be everything, and we definitely can't be everything all at once. So the priorities have been to get the flight stuff up, get that one. It's the biggest thing, get that going well first. And then we have making sure that we have the ground transportation to make sure all that stuff is -- now our people have attraction. They also want to have a lot of emphasis, too, and they are doing a great job building that, and we've talked a little bit about that. \n And that's going to come in as part of the overall connected trip because as you point out, people don't generally book their attractions far, far in advance. In fact, a lot of them want to book it when they're actually in destination, and that's why I love the fact of the increased amount of use of our app because that's like having your travel agent in your pocket and be able to -- we're able to send them great offers, great ideas where they go right to it, checks on the app and can they get something better. \n And that's why we're bringing that into our Genius program for people to have an attraction business and want to get that incremental demand. We can push something to a customer who's in destination and give us on -- bring them to that particular supplier. All over, it's a tremendous opportunity down the road. We have yet to even really scratch the possibilities with that, and that's just another reason why I see just tremendous opportunity for us as we continue to roll on. In terms of quality -- and I'd like to think that the inventory we have is high quality, obviously comes at different price points. It's a complete range. And you may not be surprised that lower-priced things may not be as luxurious the higher-priced things. And I think we cover the gamut, but we don't have enough of certain types in certain areas. And I've talked about this before. We're entering close to the summer, and I look at -- I live in the New York metropolitan area. And I'm looking, do we have enough of these high-end homes in the Hamptons? And I don't think we do. If I look at some of our competitors, I see more. \n I look at that as opportunity for us, though, because we're doing so well. Yes, we don't have all the different types of accommodations and the quantity that I want to have in that. It's great that we are as big as we are, but I absolutely see no reason we shouldn't be significantly bigger throughout every geographical area. Look, our base was Europe. So we are very, very competitive. We have great inventory, all types there. But I've talked about the U.S., and that's an area we continue to do more work. And I mentioned earlier, I see us making great progress there. Sure. So yes, and we definitely have -- you're not surprised of the fact that it's easier to get more inventory when you go to some of the managers who have significant number of the inventory you're looking for. And those multi-property managers are the place where we definitely assume more business. And we have not, until very recently, really spent a lot of time trying to do it in the low -- trying to go for individuals and trying to bring them in, too. \n There's no doubt, though, over time, we have to make sure to make an effort to everybody. And that means being sure that we are providing a platform that a supplier really likes to use. And I saw something recent. Just to give you an example, turns out that until fairly recently, it was hard for some of our big managers to be able to reconcile the payments with individual properties. And we improved that significantly recently. And that's the reason, it was, okay, now I'll do that. And I can go through a whole bunch of different individual things that, well, by themselves may not be so big. As a whole, they end up saying, yes, I will now be more than happy to get incremental demand from Booking.com because I find it easy and helpful. \n If somebody is going to make business to make money, you definitely never want to have your property empty. That's 0 revenue. You're never going to get back. That inventory expires. So that's why people are always looking to try and get more demand. As long as we provide them with demand and we provide them with a platform that they find easy and helpful, they will come to us. \n In regards to the summer and things like Paris and the Olympics, stuff like that, it's always a mystery what's going to happen with the Olympics. So I've been here now 24 years. So I've been through a whole bunch of Olympics and thought it was going to be -- this is what's going to happen and then something else happens. Here's the big point. Let's not concentrate too much on one individual event to last for a couple of weeks. \n I continue to say the important way to view value in this company in the long run. What have we done? What have we done over the last 24 years here? Continue to increase the value, bring in more customers and more suppliers and continue to produce more cash flow for our investors. That's the way we've done in the past and what we did in the past. And as far as how the Paris Olympics go, I really -- I can guess, but my guess is as good as yours. And I don't think that's something that I'd spend a lot of time worrying about. We don't disclose much more and giving you these regional growth rates. We don't go any further than that in terms of detail. And I don't think we'll be starting that right now. I understand your reason for asking, but for reason of competitiveness and such, we're not going to break this down any further than that. Thank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, our shareholders, and I especially want to thank Ewout for joining the team. Ewout, thank you very much. We greatly appreciate everyone's support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you, and good night."
