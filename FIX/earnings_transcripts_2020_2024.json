[Operator Instructions] I would like to advise all parties that this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I\u2019d now like to turn to the host for today, Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please proceed.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Sunny. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Call. Our comments this morning as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. What we will say today is based on the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a more detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Due to the commitment and resilience of our people, we were able to overcome unprecedented challenges during 2020 to achieve record earnings and cash flow. In addition to the ongoing challenges from the pandemic, our people and organizations also experienced and overcame significant adversity in Texas just last week. In 2020, we earned more than 20% of our revenue in Texas, where we have multiple strong mechanical capabilities in many markets, and Texas is also the home to our largest electrical team. Virtually, all of our operations were closed for at least 3 full days with loss of productivity throughout last week. We are now back to full capacity. I am deeply grateful for the courage and perseverance that our field employees demonstrated, last week, in Texas and in many other markets that experienced terrible weather. And I am in awe of our field workforce\u2019s grit and perseverance through COVID as every day our essential workers overcame the challenges they faced. We continue to work hard to keep our workforce and our community safe and healthy every day. 2020 was a record year for Comfort Systems USA. We finished the year with strong fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.17, and for the full year, we earned $4.09. This marks the highest annual EPS in the history of our company, even without our tax and valuation gain. Revenue for full year 2020 was also a record at $2.9 billion. Our backlog is up slightly since September, and we have very good ongoing bidding activity as we start 2021. Our 2020 free cash flow was an unprecedented $265 million. And yesterday, we again announced an increase in our dividend. At the end of 2020, we acquired a Tennessee Electric Company headquartered in Kingsport, Tennessee, and we expect they will contribute $90 million to $100 million of revenues in 2021. This acquisition was closed on December 31, 2020. So their balance sheet and backlog are included as of the last day of December. TEC is a strong electrical and mechanical contractor, but TEC also brings unique industrial construction and plant service expertise and relationships with complex industrial clients. Their results will be reported in our electrical segment starting in 2021. In December, we promoted Trent McKenna to Chief Operating Officer. Trent has been with Comfort Systems USA for 16 years, and I believe he will be a valuable leader, as we continue to grow and improve our operations. By the way, I am not going anywhere, but this added depth will provide much-needed bandwidth to our senior team.  Before I review our operating results and prospects, I want to ask Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? \nBill George: Thanks, Brian. Yes. So as Brian said, our results were again very strong. I\u2019m going to just briefly point out some things for most of the line items of our P&L. So fourth quarter revenue was $699 million, a decrease of $21 million compared to the same quarter last year. Our same-store revenue declined by a larger $68 million. However, our recent acquisitions of TAS and Starr offset that decline somewhat as they added $48 million in revenue this quarter. You may recall that last year, at this time, we had large data center work in Texas that created very high revenue in the comparable period. We will continue to face tough revenue comparisons through the first half of this year, especially in electrical, as a result of last year\u2019s big deployments.  Revenue for the full year was $2.9 billion, an increase of $241 million or 9% compared to 2019. Full year same-store revenue in 2020 was 2% lower than in 2019 due to the factors I just mentioned. Gross profit was $137 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $4 million. And gross profit as a percentage of revenue rose to 19.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 18.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, gross profit increased $45 million, and our gross profit margin was approximately flat at 19.1%. SG&A expense was $89 million or 12.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $87 million or 12% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019. The prior year fourth quarter benefited from insurance proceeds associated with the cyber incident of approximately $1.6 million, and that reduced SG&A last year.  For the full year, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 12.5% for 2020 compared to 13.0% for 2019. On a same-store basis, for the full year, SG&A declined $6 million, and that decrease was primarily due to austerity relating to COVID, such as reductions in travel-related expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we re-valued estimates relating to our earn-out liabilities, and as a result, we reported an overall gain of $7 million or $0.18 per share. For the full year, the gain associated with acquisition earn-out valuation changes was $0.20 per share. These gains were due to lower-than-forecasted earnings associated with our recent acquisitions, especially at Walker, which was more affected by COVID than our other operations. Our 2020 tax rate was 21.6% compared to 24.7% in 2019. During the third quarter of 2020, we finalized advantageous settlements with the IRS from their examination of our amended federal tax returns for 2014 and 2015. On a go-forward basis, we now expect our normalized effective tax rate will be between 25% and 30%. Although 2014 and 2015 are now settled, we have open audits relating to refunds we are claiming for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax years. But we believe that any benefits that arise from those years would most likely be recognized in 2022 or beyond. So after giving effect to all these items, we achieved record net income. Specifically, net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $43 million or $1.17 per share as compared to $34 million or $0.92 per share in 2019. Earnings per share for the current quarter included that $0.18 gain associated with earn-out revaluations. Our full year earnings per share was $4.09 per share compared to $3.08 per share in the prior year. The current year also included a tax benefit of $0.17 that we reported in the third quarter of 2020 from a discrete tax item. The gains associated with earn-out revaluations, which for the full year was $0.20. For the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $63 million, which is 6% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Our annual 2020 EBITDA was a milestone achievement for us, as our full year EBITDA was $250 million. Cash flow for 2020 was extraordinary. Our full year free cash flow was $255 million compared to $112 million in 2019. Our 2020 cash flow includes roughly $32 million of benefit, that\u2019s a direct result of the Federal Stimulus Bill, which allowed us to defer payroll tax payments in the last nine months of 2020. These tax deferrals will be repaid in two equal installments in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022. Even with our acquisition expenditures, we were able to reduce our debt to less than one turn of trailing 12-month EBITDA. 2020 was our largest year for share repurchases in quite some time, as we reduced our overall shares outstanding by repurchasing 685,000 of our shares at an average price of $43.99. Since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back over 9.3 million shares at an average price under $20. That\u2019s all I have, Brian.\nBrian Lane : Okay. Thanks, Bill. I\u2019m going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for 2021. Our backlog level at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.51 billion. Sequentially, our same-store backlog increased by $10 million, with particular strength in our modular backlog. Same-store backlog compared to one year ago has decreased by $375 million, of which approximately, one third related to an expected decline in our electrical segment. We are also experiencing delays in bookings and in project starts at certain of our large private companies. Overall, we are comfortable, we are very comfortable with the backlog we have across our operating locations. As our booked work at the end of 2019 included some live beta projects and that comparison represented an unusually high level of backlog. Most of our sectors continued to have strong quotation activity, even the sectors where bookings have been delayed. That is particularly true on our industrial business, which includes technology, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and food processing. Our industrial revenue has grown to 39% of total revenue in 2020 compared to 34% a year ago. We expect this sector to continue to be strong, and the majority of TAS and TEC revenues are industrial. Institutional markets, which includes education, healthcare and government, were 36% of our revenue, and that is roughly consistent with what we saw in 2019. The commercial sector was 25% of our revenue. For 2020, construction was 79% of our revenue with 47% from construction projects for new buildings and 32% from construction projects in existing buildings. Both of our construction and service businesses achieved record operating income margin. Service was 21% of our 2020 revenue with service projects providing 8% of revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 13% of revenue. Beginning in late March, our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impacts associated with COVID-19, largely as a result of building closures and decisions by customers to limit facility access. We are seeing good opportunities in internal air quality, which has helped many of our service departments return to pre-pandemic volumes. The most important element of IAQ is this, is not just the immediate revenue, but also the opportunity to use our unmatched expertise to create new relationships. This really plays to our strength of solving problems for our customers, and it is not just a service story. As air quality considerations really add to our ability to differentiate and add value in construction and at times will increase the size and complexity of even large projects. Overall, our service operations ended the year with improved profitability, and thus, today, they are back to prior volumes. Despite pandemic-related challenges, our mechanical segment performed incredibly well during the quarter. We are grateful for our performance this year, and our prospects are much better than we would have expected this past spring. Our electrical segment had a tougher 2020 than we would have liked, but we currently expect good margin improvement in electrical in 2021. Finally, our outlook. Our backlog strengthened this quarter, but our near-term business continues to reflect some delays in bookings and starts that will result in same-store revenue headwinds in the first half of 2021. At the same time, we have really strong project development and planning activity with our customers. We are increasingly optimistic about 2021 and beyond because of that strong pipeline. We currently expect full year 2021 results that are similar to, but lower than, the record results that we achieved in 2020. We continue to prepare for a wide range of potential circumstances in nonresidential construction in the coming quarters. However, we perceived strong trends, especially in industrial, technology and manufacturing.  And we think our geographic markets are favorably positioned with comparatively strong prospects. We look forward to good profits and cash flow in 2021. We have an unmatched workforce and a great and essential business, and we will continue to invest our reliable cash flows to make the most of these advantages and opportunities. Thank you once again to our employees for your high work and dedication. I will now turn it back over to Sunny for questions. Thank you.\nOperator:  [Operator Instructions] We have a question on the audio. It comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: So I just wanted to start on the bookings. I mean, is it fair to say the bookings were better than expected in the fourth quarter? And the commentary is that you\u2019re still seeing some delays in the near term, but if I\u2019m hearing you right, the bid pipeline is quite strong. So maybe you could expand on that, maybe comment on what\u2019s improved, maybe where the bid pipeline is relative to, say, this time last year. And do you think we\u2019re going to see some larger projects get awarded in 2021?\nBrian Lane : Sean, that\u2019s a great question. The fourth quarter trend, our book-to-burn was over one probably the first time in 1.5 years. So we\u2019re seeing plenty of good opportunities. A lot of it\u2019s timing. You get the right paid work to put into backlog, but we\u2019re relatively optimistic throughout the country with the opportunities we\u2019re seeing in the sectors we talked about. There\u2019s a lot of stuff we\u2019re working on, getting good feedback from customers that they\u2019re ready to go.  It\u2019s more of a timing issue. I think the first half, you\u2019ll see us booking this stuff. But I was really pleasantly surprised, in the fourth quarter, particularly in the modular sector, where we received a lot of really strong opportunities. And I\u2019m really confident that\u2019s going to continue on as we go through 2021.\nSean Eastman: And I\u2019m just trying to think through the puts and takes on margins. I guess the question really is where are margins trending directionally in 2021. Service is back at 2019 volumes entering \u201821. Electrical should be contributing at higher margins. Is there anything else we need to think about there?\nBill George: This is Bill. I think that the margins we achieved in mechanical are pretty sustainable. It might be hard to quite crush it the way they just did, but especially, as we get to the second half of the year, I like our margins there. I think we have improvement in electrical. One, we have a, frankly, we have a manageable comparable in electrical. And by the way, electrical did pretty well for us. It had our best cash flow for the year. It was a bit nice EPS contributor. So it\u2019s not that electrical did bad, but they have room -- they definitely have room in the coming year for improvement. And then I do think -- SG&A may -- SG&A will creep back just a little, maybe a couple of basis points because of travel will wake up a little bit, and people really, really got after their costs in the middle of this past year. So we\u2019ll start training even -- we kept training, but we\u2019ll probably do more of that. And so there\u2019ll be a little bit more of that, but it looks good.\nBrian Lane: And Sean, just to add on, on the margins, I mean, the execution was just stellar, in my opinion, and we\u2019re still the same folks out there, that\u2019s still going to do good work for us. So I agree with everything Bill said.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Great. And last one for me. I mean you guys talked about the indoor air quality. It sounds like it\u2019s developing opportunity set there. But if you read through this new administration\u2019s platform, I mean there\u2019s a lot of talk on retrofitting buildings and reducing building emissions. I mean is that something that you\u2019re seeing develop in the pipeline? Do you think that\u2019s interesting, a potential positive for Comfort Systems?\nBrian Lane: Yes. Sean, it\u2019s Brian again. Absolutely, we\u2019re seeing a lot of opportunities already. We\u2019ve had a lot of work booked and completed, whole range of solutions for a building. A lot of it\u2019s right now focused, I think, on the service side of it, to get people back in the building in small projects. But I think if you look at the next 12 to 24 months, I think you\u2019re going to see it be a significantly larger portion of new build construction, where they\u2019re going to expect -- it\u2019s going to go -- it\u2019s going into engineering already, whether be it chillers -- et cetera, et cetera. So I think it\u2019s going to be a very good opportunity for Comfort Systems for a long time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Brian, can you walk us around the country a little bit, just geographically what you\u2019re seeing?\nBrian Lane: Yes. Absolutely, Adam. Up in the Northeast, we\u2019ll see a lot of outstanding, really outstanding opportunities. Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Central New York, we\u2019re almost sold out, really. As you come down the coast, the Mid-Atlantic, we\u2019ve got exceptional companies there. Whether you\u2019re in Richmond, Virginia, that\u2019s showing the valley, those folks have a lot of opportunities. So in the pharmaceutical business in that neck of the woods with our folks. In Greensboro and that area, I think there\u2019s plenty of opportunities. I mean, where you live, Adam, you know when you see it. There\u2019s a lot of stuff going on down there. The Southeast, you\u2019ll probably hear this from everyone, it\u2019s really strong. Florida, it\u2019s very strong. Health care is very good in Florida. So we see a significant amount of opportunities. Georgia, where you have industrial battery plants or whatever going through. Texas probably had a little bit of a lull, but I believe that\u2019s going to pick up. There\u2019s still a lot of companies moving here. Dallas is very strong. San Antonio, extremely strong. And Austin is very good. Houston is probably the slowest in the markets, but Texas is Texas. Out in the West, we\u2019re not as big out West as we are East of the Mississippi. Denver is very good. Phoenix is good, but not California. And up North, we\u2019re relatively small. We added our capabilities in the Utah market with a very good company there that has a lot of strength. So we\u2019re really optimistic about Utah. And then, of course, up in the middle of the country is we have some of our strongest companies that we had. I think you\u2019ll see them maybe a little soft in the first quarter, but their opportunities are good. So we see pretty good balance throughout the country and opportunities, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, probably being the strongest, if I had to give you my view right now. \nBill George: And the upper Midwest is going to keep --\nBrian Lane: Yes, the upper Midwest is going to, yes. \nBill George: We\u2019ve got a couple of companies there that have multi-decade histories of performance. \nBrian Lane: Yes. Does that help, Adam? \nAdam Thalhimer: That helps. And then do you see aggressive bidding anywhere, or is that pretty much just unchanged? \nBrian Lane: I think -- just a little bit, but we got probably a little bit of margin pressure. You get some of the PPE money that\u2019s maybe running around on some of these projects. But in general, it\u2019s not 2008, 2009, 2010 where people were just bottomed downward. And this rough philosophy, Adam -- we have very prudent risk managers about the type of work, very selective on the type of work we make. So we\u2019re not going to go dive and to take work. Bill, do you want to add on to that? \nBill George: Yes. I think on jobs, 10 million and below, there\u2019s a handful of markets where there\u2019s contractors given away the labor they got paid for by the federal government with the PPP loans. The good news is that\u2019s not really the work we want. And really, part of our little bit of delay here is what Brian just alluded to, it\u2019s, our guys are very demanding and disciplined. We\u2019re going to be good. \nAdam Thalhimer: And then I hear you loud and clear on the modular. And my assumption would be on modular, I don\u2019t know if you face any competitive issues. \nBill George: Well, so modular, we had some really great technology bookings in the fourth quarter on some programs we\u2019ve been working on for a long time. And so it\u2019s nice to see those programs get -- really get purchase orders and get going. For us, I agree, I mean, I think the modular solutions we offer people, our biggest problem is having people figure out how good it is, honestly, but more and more are. \nBrian Lane: I\u2019ll tell you, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s -- we could be happier with the performance of the companies that do modular in Comfort Systems. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. \nBrent Thielman: I want to come back to Texas. Just wondering if some of the disruptions down there and the commentary around that, whether that\u2019s a net headwind in the first quarter? \nBrian Lane: So, for Texas, in the first quarter, we lost 3 to 5 days of work. A lot of it was made up on the weekend in our modular plants here. We have about two thirds of 1 million square foot, 600,000 square feet of modular space. They lost three production days, but they made up at least two of them over the weekend. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s a rounding error. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that -- there could be slightly less revenue. Plus, Brent, the service business we had every person that even thought of doing service business, particularly on the plumbing side, as you can imagine, still going on, quite frankly, throughout the state. So we\u2019ve got a real uptick in service business over the last two weeks in Texas.\nBrent Thielman : It\u2019s not a terrible time to be good at fixing any kind of pipe...\nBrian Lane : Yes...\nBill George: And actually, our electrical company was able to pull a rabbit out of the hat for some of their customers to keep their generators going and stuff. And we really -- that\u2019s just a little bit of money now, but we really think we might have created some good momentum with some customers by doing that.\nBrian Lane: So I think in the aggregate, it\u2019s not going to be a big issue between the weekend work and the service work and...\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Okay. And then Brian or Bill, some of the first half holes that you talked about can those still potentially be filled with short duration related work, just depending on how the next few months go. I just want to get your thoughts around that.\nBill George: Yes. The first thing I would say is, it\u2019s not really empty, right? It\u2019s just not as good as it was last year. So people -- our guys have plenty of work to do. There\u2019s no -- I don\u2019t know of any shortened work weeks, anywhere, no go. But last year was off the charts. And so it\u2019s just a -- it\u2019s a relative air pocket. The other really interesting thing when you talk about the first half is, keep in mind, we had an odd -- well, we had a -- when we say that we are going to be -- have a little bit of relative slowness in the first half, we\u2019re talking about compared to a normal pattern. We\u2019re not necessarily talking about compared to last year. Keep in mind, last year, the first quarter was the COVID quarter, and we were probably came in -- we came in much below what a normalized quarter would have been even though we did better than we expected. The second quarter really will be a tough test comparable for us because, frankly, some of the money came right back in the second quarter last year. And we just had an off-the-charts second quarter last year in the midst of what was going on. And then we have -- as you just saw, we had tough comparables in the third and fourth quarter. A big part of this, this is not Comfort saying, \"oh, we have a problem next year.\"\nBrian Lane: No.\nBill George: We\u2019re going to make a ton of money and flow a lot of cash. It\u2019s just that we just -- we\u2019re coming off a tough comparables.\nBrian Lane: No. We still have $1.5 billion worth of construction work to do. So we\u2019ve got to do that well.\nBill George: And we -- a year ago, we had some 100 million-plus jobs that -- which was unheard of for us, that are hot and heavy. And that just -- that\u2019s the only time that\u2019s ever happened, actually. I\u2019d say one other thing. I know I should. That -- even if we have a revenue headwind, our margins will be better, right? A lot of that work was fee work at low gross margin with a lot of material pass-through. So our mix of work from the point of view of margins is much better for this year.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. And then the latest acquisition, the margins attached to that, how do they compare to the core electrical business for Comfort?\nBill George: They will average up the margins of our overall electrical business because they\u2019re so heavily industrial. And so they do a ton of like stainless steel and stuff like that. So they...\nBrian Lane: They got about -- just about every kind of welding capability you can think of, Brent.\nBill George: And they\u2019re in there doing it for the hardest customers in the world.\nBrian Lane: Yes, and they\u2019re doing it well.\nBill George: And they -- and so their margins are more like our mechanical margins. So that can only -- that will only help.\nBrent Thielman: There are some things they\u2019re doing that you think you can take away to your own business there?\nBill George: Over a long period of time, you don\u2019t just cross the street and start doing what they\u2019re doing.\nBrian Lane: But what\u2019s interesting, Brent, they hardly worked with a bunch of our sister companies around them. The sheet metal haul for some of the fabrication, and we think that is just going to be enhanced, that they can do more work in the area they\u2019re in, of Kingsport, Tennessee.\nBrent Thielman: And then lastly, with Trent moving into the COO role, and Brian, glad to hear you\u2019re still sticking around. But just wondering if that, we can take from that, that you\u2019re going to be even more focused on business development, M&A opportunities going forward. Just curious about that transition.\nBrian Lane: Well, Bill George is unique and as good as they get on M&A that I\u2019ve ever seen. I\u2019ll probably do a lot more work on development and probably on electrical side of the business and some of these other businesses, but it\u2019s going to be, Trent will be rolling into day-to-day operations. So we\u2019ll see how that goes, Brian.\nBill George: Let\u2019s just say we haven\u2019t been overstaffed in the past.\nBrian Lane: We haven\u2019t been overstaffed, yes. It\u2019s exciting for him and it\u2019s exciting for the company in the long term.\nBrent Thielman: Okay, well congrats on a strong year. Thanks for taking the questions.\nBrian Lane: All right, thanks, Brent.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Julio Romero from Sidoti Company. Please see Julio you live in the call.\nJulio Romero: So you spoke to the margins of the Tennessee Electrical acquisition. Could you speak to the cadence of revenue and earnings? Is that going to be kind of in line with the electrical?\nBill George: So don\u2019t make, we expect them to contribute about $100 million of revenue for this year margins, really equivalent to Comfort overall, really, which are very good, obviously, more like the average margins of Comfort than the average margins you\u2019ve seen in electrical.\nJulio Romero: Okay. And I wanted to peel back your commentary about IAQ in creating new relationships. Can you give us a little more color on that? Are you alluding to some share gains there?\nBrian Lane: We\u2019re in multiple markets throughout the country. So we\u2019re picking up more school work than we probably have done in the past, a little bit more industrial work. So it\u2019s just that we have a pretty developed capability in pretty much all the aspects of IAQ solution options. And we\u2019ve just been presenting to a lot of customers and customers maybe we hadn\u2019t called on typically before in the construction sector. So it\u2019s a really good opportunity for us with something that we\u2019re very good at.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no current questions, and I\u2019ll hand back over to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thank you. In closing, I want to again thank our wonderful employees. The results our teams accomplished this year were truly amazing. I have never felt better about the company and its future. We are looking forward to seeing you, again, in person soon. But in the meanwhile, please be safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you to all speakers. That concludes your conference call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Due to the commitment and resilience of our people, we were able to overcome unprecedented challenges during 2020 to achieve record earnings and cash flow. In addition to the ongoing challenges from the pandemic, our people and organizations also experienced and overcame significant adversity in Texas just last week. In 2020, we earned more than 20% of our revenue in Texas, where we have multiple strong mechanical capabilities in many markets, and Texas is also the home to our largest electrical team. Virtually, all of our operations were closed for at least 3 full days with loss of productivity throughout last week. We are now back to full capacity. I am deeply grateful for the courage and perseverance that our field employees demonstrated, last week, in Texas and in many other markets that experienced terrible weather. And I am in awe of our field workforce's grit and perseverance through COVID as every day our essential workers overcame the challenges they faced. We continue to work hard to keep our workforce and our community safe and healthy every day. 2020 was a record year for Comfort Systems USA. We finished the year with strong fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.17, and for the full year, we earned $4.09. This marks the highest annual EPS in the history of our company, even without our tax and valuation gain. Revenue for full year 2020 was also a record at $2.9 billion. Our backlog is up slightly since September, and we have very good ongoing bidding activity as we start 2021. Our 2020 free cash flow was an unprecedented $265 million. And yesterday, we again announced an increase in our dividend. At the end of 2020, we acquired a Tennessee Electric Company headquartered in Kingsport, Tennessee, and we expect they will contribute $90 million to $100 million of revenues in 2021. This acquisition was closed on December 31, 2020. So their balance sheet and backlog are included as of the last day of December. TEC is a strong electrical and mechanical contractor, but TEC also brings unique industrial construction and plant service expertise and relationships with complex industrial clients. Their results will be reported in our electrical segment starting in 2021. In December, we promoted Trent McKenna to Chief Operating Officer. Trent has been with Comfort Systems USA for 16 years, and I believe he will be a valuable leader, as we continue to grow and improve our operations. By the way, I am not going anywhere, but this added depth will provide much-needed bandwidth to our senior team.  Before I review our operating results and prospects, I want to ask Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? Okay. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for 2021. Our backlog level at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.51 billion. Sequentially, our same-store backlog increased by $10 million, with particular strength in our modular backlog. Same-store backlog compared to one year ago has decreased by $375 million, of which approximately, one third related to an expected decline in our electrical segment. We are also experiencing delays in bookings and in project starts at certain of our large private companies. Overall, we are comfortable, we are very comfortable with the backlog we have across our operating locations. As our booked work at the end of 2019 included some live beta projects and that comparison represented an unusually high level of backlog. Most of our sectors continued to have strong quotation activity, even the sectors where bookings have been delayed. That is particularly true on our industrial business, which includes technology, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and food processing. Our industrial revenue has grown to 39% of total revenue in 2020 compared to 34% a year ago. We expect this sector to continue to be strong, and the majority of TAS and TEC revenues are industrial. Institutional markets, which includes education, healthcare and government, were 36% of our revenue, and that is roughly consistent with what we saw in 2019. The commercial sector was 25% of our revenue. For 2020, construction was 79% of our revenue with 47% from construction projects for new buildings and 32% from construction projects in existing buildings. Both of our construction and service businesses achieved record operating income margin. Service was 21% of our 2020 revenue with service projects providing 8% of revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 13% of revenue. Beginning in late March, our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impacts associated with COVID-19, largely as a result of building closures and decisions by customers to limit facility access. We are seeing good opportunities in internal air quality, which has helped many of our service departments return to pre-pandemic volumes. The most important element of IAQ is this, is not just the immediate revenue, but also the opportunity to use our unmatched expertise to create new relationships. This really plays to our strength of solving problems for our customers, and it is not just a service story. As air quality considerations really add to our ability to differentiate and add value in construction and at times will increase the size and complexity of even large projects. Overall, our service operations ended the year with improved profitability, and thus, today, they are back to prior volumes. Despite pandemic-related challenges, our mechanical segment performed incredibly well during the quarter. We are grateful for our performance this year, and our prospects are much better than we would have expected this past spring. Our electrical segment had a tougher 2020 than we would have liked, but we currently expect good margin improvement in electrical in 2021. Finally, our outlook. Our backlog strengthened this quarter, but our near-term business continues to reflect some delays in bookings and starts that will result in same-store revenue headwinds in the first half of 2021. At the same time, we have really strong project development and planning activity with our customers. We are increasingly optimistic about 2021 and beyond because of that strong pipeline. We currently expect full year 2021 results that are similar to, but lower than, the record results that we achieved in 2020. We continue to prepare for a wide range of potential circumstances in nonresidential construction in the coming quarters. However, we perceived strong trends, especially in industrial, technology and manufacturing.  And we think our geographic markets are favorably positioned with comparatively strong prospects. We look forward to good profits and cash flow in 2021. We have an unmatched workforce and a great and essential business, and we will continue to invest our reliable cash flows to make the most of these advantages and opportunities. Thank you once again to our employees for your high work and dedication. I will now turn it back over to Sunny for questions. Thank you. Sean, that's a great question. The fourth quarter trend, our book-to-burn was over one probably the first time in 1.5 years. So we're seeing plenty of good opportunities. A lot of it's timing. You get the right paid work to put into backlog, but we're relatively optimistic throughout the country with the opportunities we're seeing in the sectors we talked about. There's a lot of stuff we're working on, getting good feedback from customers that they're ready to go.  It's more of a timing issue. I think the first half, you'll see us booking this stuff. But I was really pleasantly surprised, in the fourth quarter, particularly in the modular sector, where we received a lot of really strong opportunities. And I'm really confident that's going to continue on as we go through 2021. And Sean, just to add on, on the margins, I mean, the execution was just stellar, in my opinion, and we're still the same folks out there, that's still going to do good work for us. So I agree with everything Bill said. Yes. Sean, it's Brian again. Absolutely, we're seeing a lot of opportunities already. We've had a lot of work booked and completed, whole range of solutions for a building. A lot of it's right now focused, I think, on the service side of it, to get people back in the building in small projects. But I think if you look at the next 12 to 24 months, I think you're going to see it be a significantly larger portion of new build construction, where they're going to expect -- it's going to go -- it's going into engineering already, whether be it chillers -- et cetera, et cetera. So I think it's going to be a very good opportunity for Comfort Systems for a long time. Yes. Absolutely, Adam. Up in the Northeast, we'll see a lot of outstanding, really outstanding opportunities. Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Central New York, we're almost sold out, really. As you come down the coast, the Mid-Atlantic, we've got exceptional companies there. Whether you're in Richmond, Virginia, that's showing the valley, those folks have a lot of opportunities. So in the pharmaceutical business in that neck of the woods with our folks. In Greensboro and that area, I think there's plenty of opportunities. I mean, where you live, Adam, you know when you see it. There's a lot of stuff going on down there. The Southeast, you'll probably hear this from everyone, it's really strong. Florida, it's very strong. Health care is very good in Florida. So we see a significant amount of opportunities. Georgia, where you have industrial battery plants or whatever going through. Texas probably had a little bit of a lull, but I believe that's going to pick up. There's still a lot of companies moving here. Dallas is very strong. San Antonio, extremely strong. And Austin is very good. Houston is probably the slowest in the markets, but Texas is Texas. Out in the West, we're not as big out West as we are East of the Mississippi. Denver is very good. Phoenix is good, but not California. And up North, we're relatively small. We added our capabilities in the Utah market with a very good company there that has a lot of strength. So we're really optimistic about Utah. And then, of course, up in the middle of the country is we have some of our strongest companies that we had. I think you'll see them maybe a little soft in the first quarter, but their opportunities are good. So we see pretty good balance throughout the country and opportunities, Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, probably being the strongest, if I had to give you my view right now. Yes, the upper Midwest is going to, yes. Yes. Does that help, Adam? I think -- just a little bit, but we got probably a little bit of margin pressure. You get some of the PPE money that's maybe running around on some of these projects. But in general, it's not 2008, 2009, 2010 where people were just bottomed downward. And this rough philosophy, Adam -- we have very prudent risk managers about the type of work, very selective on the type of work we make. So we're not going to go dive and to take work. Bill, do you want to add on to that? I'll tell you, I don't think it's -- we could be happier with the performance of the companies that do modular in Comfort Systems. So, for Texas, in the first quarter, we lost 3 to 5 days of work. A lot of it was made up on the weekend in our modular plants here. We have about two thirds of 1 million square foot, 600,000 square feet of modular space. They lost three production days, but they made up at least two of them over the weekend. So I don't think it's -- I think it's a rounding error. I don't think it's something that -- there could be slightly less revenue. Plus, Brent, the service business we had every person that even thought of doing service business, particularly on the plumbing side, as you can imagine, still going on, quite frankly, throughout the state. So we've got a real uptick in service business over the last two weeks in Texas. Yes... So I think in the aggregate, it's not going to be a big issue between the weekend work and the service work and... No. No. We still have $1.5 billion worth of construction work to do. So we've got to do that well. They got about -- just about every kind of welding capability you can think of, Brent. Yes, and they're doing it well. But what's interesting, Brent, they hardly worked with a bunch of our sister companies around them. The sheet metal haul for some of the fabrication, and we think that is just going to be enhanced, that they can do more work in the area they're in, of Kingsport, Tennessee. Well, Bill George is unique and as good as they get on M&A that I've ever seen. I'll probably do a lot more work on development and probably on electrical side of the business and some of these other businesses, but it's going to be, Trent will be rolling into day-to-day operations. So we'll see how that goes, Brian. We haven't been overstaffed, yes. It's exciting for him and it's exciting for the company in the long term. All right, thanks, Brent. We're in multiple markets throughout the country. So we're picking up more school work than we probably have done in the past, a little bit more industrial work. So it's just that we have a pretty developed capability in pretty much all the aspects of IAQ solution options. And we've just been presenting to a lot of customers and customers maybe we hadn't called on typically before in the construction sector. So it's a really good opportunity for us with something that we're very good at. All right. Thank you. In closing, I want to again thank our wonderful employees. The results our teams accomplished this year were truly amazing. I have never felt better about the company and its future. We are looking forward to seeing you, again, in person soon. But in the meanwhile, please be safe. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill George",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Yes. So as Brian said, our results were again very strong. I'm going to just briefly point out some things for most of the line items of our P&L. So fourth quarter revenue was $699 million, a decrease of $21 million compared to the same quarter last year. Our same-store revenue declined by a larger $68 million. However, our recent acquisitions of TAS and Starr offset that decline somewhat as they added $48 million in revenue this quarter. You may recall that last year, at this time, we had large data center work in Texas that created very high revenue in the comparable period. We will continue to face tough revenue comparisons through the first half of this year, especially in electrical, as a result of last year's big deployments.  Revenue for the full year was $2.9 billion, an increase of $241 million or 9% compared to 2019. Full year same-store revenue in 2020 was 2% lower than in 2019 due to the factors I just mentioned. Gross profit was $137 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $4 million. And gross profit as a percentage of revenue rose to 19.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 18.4% for the fourth quarter of 2019. For the full year, gross profit increased $45 million, and our gross profit margin was approximately flat at 19.1%. SG&A expense was $89 million or 12.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $87 million or 12% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2019. The prior year fourth quarter benefited from insurance proceeds associated with the cyber incident of approximately $1.6 million, and that reduced SG&A last year.  For the full year, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 12.5% for 2020 compared to 13.0% for 2019. On a same-store basis, for the full year, SG&A declined $6 million, and that decrease was primarily due to austerity relating to COVID, such as reductions in travel-related expenses. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we re-valued estimates relating to our earn-out liabilities, and as a result, we reported an overall gain of $7 million or $0.18 per share. For the full year, the gain associated with acquisition earn-out valuation changes was $0.20 per share. These gains were due to lower-than-forecasted earnings associated with our recent acquisitions, especially at Walker, which was more affected by COVID than our other operations. Our 2020 tax rate was 21.6% compared to 24.7% in 2019. During the third quarter of 2020, we finalized advantageous settlements with the IRS from their examination of our amended federal tax returns for 2014 and 2015. On a go-forward basis, we now expect our normalized effective tax rate will be between 25% and 30%. Although 2014 and 2015 are now settled, we have open audits relating to refunds we are claiming for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax years. But we believe that any benefits that arise from those years would most likely be recognized in 2022 or beyond. So after giving effect to all these items, we achieved record net income. Specifically, net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $43 million or $1.17 per share as compared to $34 million or $0.92 per share in 2019. Earnings per share for the current quarter included that $0.18 gain associated with earn-out revaluations. Our full year earnings per share was $4.09 per share compared to $3.08 per share in the prior year. The current year also included a tax benefit of $0.17 that we reported in the third quarter of 2020 from a discrete tax item. The gains associated with earn-out revaluations, which for the full year was $0.20. For the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $63 million, which is 6% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Our annual 2020 EBITDA was a milestone achievement for us, as our full year EBITDA was $250 million. Cash flow for 2020 was extraordinary. Our full year free cash flow was $255 million compared to $112 million in 2019. Our 2020 cash flow includes roughly $32 million of benefit, that's a direct result of the Federal Stimulus Bill, which allowed us to defer payroll tax payments in the last nine months of 2020. These tax deferrals will be repaid in two equal installments in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022. Even with our acquisition expenditures, we were able to reduce our debt to less than one turn of trailing 12-month EBITDA. 2020 was our largest year for share repurchases in quite some time, as we reduced our overall shares outstanding by repurchasing 685,000 of our shares at an average price of $43.99. Since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back over 9.3 million shares at an average price under $20. That's all I have, Brian. This is Bill. I think that the margins we achieved in mechanical are pretty sustainable. It might be hard to quite crush it the way they just did, but especially, as we get to the second half of the year, I like our margins there. I think we have improvement in electrical. One, we have a, frankly, we have a manageable comparable in electrical. And by the way, electrical did pretty well for us. It had our best cash flow for the year. It was a bit nice EPS contributor. So it's not that electrical did bad, but they have room -- they definitely have room in the coming year for improvement. And then I do think -- SG&A may -- SG&A will creep back just a little, maybe a couple of basis points because of travel will wake up a little bit, and people really, really got after their costs in the middle of this past year. So we'll start training even -- we kept training, but we'll probably do more of that. And so there'll be a little bit more of that, but it looks good. And the upper Midwest is going to keep -- We've got a couple of companies there that have multi-decade histories of performance. Yes. I think on jobs, 10 million and below, there's a handful of markets where there's contractors given away the labor they got paid for by the federal government with the PPP loans. The good news is that's not really the work we want. And really, part of our little bit of delay here is what Brian just alluded to, it's, our guys are very demanding and disciplined. We're going to be good. Well, so modular, we had some really great technology bookings in the fourth quarter on some programs we've been working on for a long time. And so it's nice to see those programs get -- really get purchase orders and get going. For us, I agree, I mean, I think the modular solutions we offer people, our biggest problem is having people figure out how good it is, honestly, but more and more are. And actually, our electrical company was able to pull a rabbit out of the hat for some of their customers to keep their generators going and stuff. And we really -- that's just a little bit of money now, but we really think we might have created some good momentum with some customers by doing that. Yes. The first thing I would say is, it's not really empty, right? It's just not as good as it was last year. So people -- our guys have plenty of work to do. There's no -- I don't know of any shortened work weeks, anywhere, no go. But last year was off the charts. And so it's just a -- it's a relative air pocket. The other really interesting thing when you talk about the first half is, keep in mind, we had an odd -- well, we had a -- when we say that we are going to be -- have a little bit of relative slowness in the first half, we're talking about compared to a normal pattern. We're not necessarily talking about compared to last year. Keep in mind, last year, the first quarter was the COVID quarter, and we were probably came in -- we came in much below what a normalized quarter would have been even though we did better than we expected. The second quarter really will be a tough test comparable for us because, frankly, some of the money came right back in the second quarter last year. And we just had an off-the-charts second quarter last year in the midst of what was going on. And then we have -- as you just saw, we had tough comparables in the third and fourth quarter. A big part of this, this is not Comfort saying, \"oh, we have a problem next year.\" We're going to make a ton of money and flow a lot of cash. It's just that we just -- we're coming off a tough comparables. And we -- a year ago, we had some 100 million-plus jobs that -- which was unheard of for us, that are hot and heavy. And that just -- that's the only time that's ever happened, actually. I'd say one other thing. I know I should. That -- even if we have a revenue headwind, our margins will be better, right? A lot of that work was fee work at low gross margin with a lot of material pass-through. So our mix of work from the point of view of margins is much better for this year. They will average up the margins of our overall electrical business because they're so heavily industrial. And so they do a ton of like stainless steel and stuff like that. So they... And they're in there doing it for the hardest customers in the world. And they -- and so their margins are more like our mechanical margins. So that can only -- that will only help. Over a long period of time, you don't just cross the street and start doing what they're doing. Let's just say we haven't been overstaffed in the past. So don't make, we expect them to contribute about $100 million of revenue for this year margins, really equivalent to Comfort overall, really, which are very good, obviously, more like the average margins of Comfort than the average margins you've seen in electrical."

My name is Sheila, I'm the operator for today. During the presentation, your lines will remain on listen-only. [Operator Instructions] I'd like to advise all parties, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And now, I'd like to hand over to Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please proceed.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Sheila. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's third quarter earnings call. Our comments this morning, as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. What we will say today is based on the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a more detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, as well as in our press release, covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. This presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay, thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We are all facing unique challenges now from the global pandemic and in the midst of that, we appreciate our good performance and solid prospects. More than anything, I am grateful for our employees and I want to thank all of them for their commitment and resilience during this difficult time. Our employees continue to rise to the occasion, I feel gratitude and admiration for them every day. We are working hard to keep our workforce and our community safe and healthy during COVID-19. Despite adversity, Comfort Systems USA achieved record earnings and impressive cash flow. We earned $1.36 per share this quarter compared to $0.98 per share in the same quarter of last year. This quarter included a $0.17 benefit from a discrete tax item. This marks the highest quarterly EPS in the history of our company with all [ph] it out the tax benefit. Revenues was $714 million for the quarter and our year-to-date revenues exceed $2.1 billion. Through nine months, we had $199 million of free cash flow more than double the good results we achieved in the same time frame last year. Our backlog has trended downwards on this quarter, but we feel good about our prospects. And as you can see, we continue to increase our dividend. In a few minutes, I will spend some time on how that might affect us next year. Before I review our operational results and prospects. I want to ask Bill to review the details of our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George: Thanks, Brian. As Brian said, we once again achieved record positive results. Revenue in the third quarter was $714 million, an increase of $7 million compared to the same quarter last year. This increase is due to the current year acquisitions of TAS and Starr, both of which contributed to our expanding modular construction offering. This increase was offset by a decrease in same-store revenue of 6%. Our mechanical segment was up slightly on a same-store basis. So the decrease resulted from lower volume in our electrical services segment due to a combination of very high revenue comparisons in the prior year combined with deferred starts and other delays this year. Last year we experienced very high revenues in electrical as we were mobilized on certain exceptionally large jobs from the second half of 2019 until the middle of this year. As a result of these factors, we will continue to face tough revenue comparisons in electrical through the first half of next year. And combined with the air pockets and delays that we are currently experiencing, we expect continuing same-store revenue headwinds during the second quarter of next year, especially in our two largest Texas markets. Gross profit was $147 million for the third quarter of 2020, a 3% increase compared to last year. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue rose to 20.6% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 20.2% for the third quarter of 2019. SG&A expense was $91 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $90 million for the third quarter of 2019. SG&A as a percentage of revenue remained steady at 12.7% for both quarters. On a same-store basis, SG&A declined $4 million. This decrease is primarily due to cost control measures such as reduction in travel-related expenses. During the third quarter of 2020, we had an increase in tax planning and consulting fees of approximately $2 million which partially offset other declines. Our quarter-to-date effective rate was 14.2% for tax and benefited from R&D credits and energy-efficient commercial building deductions that were previously reserved. During the third quarter, we finalized settlements with the IRS from their examination of our amended federal tax returns for 2014 and 2015. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for the full year 2020 will be between 22% and 25%, which reflects these settlements. Starting in 2021, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 25% and 30% and if you eliminate the benefits of the settlement, our quarterly tax rate this quarter would have been slightly over 28%. Although 2014 and 2015 are now settled, we have open processes ongoing for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years. And while future benefits are possible, we believe any benefits that arise from those years will most likely be recognizable in 2022 or beyond. Net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $50 million or $1.36 per share as compared to $36 million or $0.98 per share in 2019. Earnings per share for the current quarter included $0.17 related to the tax benefit that I previously discussed and that benefited net of related tax consulting fees of $2.8 million that were incurred during the quarter. Even if you completely exclude the tax benefit, we had a 21% increase in earnings per share. For the third quarter, EBITDA was $72 million, an increase of 8% compared to the $66 million of EBITDA that we reported in the third quarter of last year. Our trailing 12-month EBITDA is a record $246 million. Coming up an extraordinary cash flow in the last quarter, our free cash flow continues to be strong and was $48 million in the current quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow was $199 million compared to $79 million in 2019. Our nine months' cash flow includes roughly $20 million of benefit that is a direct result of the federal stimulus bill, which allowed us to defer certain payroll tax payments in the second and third quarter. Our best estimate is that the discrete tax provisions will benefit fourth quarter cash flow by approximately $10 million. This estimated $30 million of full-year 2020 cash flow benefit from these tax provisions will be repaid to the federal government in two equal installments in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022. The phenomenal cash flow this year has resulted in two important balance sheet accomplishments; first, we were able to reduce our leverage to less than 1 turn of trailing 12-month EBITDA about a year sooner than we had anticipated. Second, during the second quarter of 2020, we funded our second largest acquisition ever. However, we were able to fund that acquisition entirely from free cash flow during the quarter, and we still managed to reduce our debt levels. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow is $233 million. Since the beginning of this year, we have purchased 448,000 of our shares at an average price of $41.90. Since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back over nine million shares at an average price of $18.89. Now to Brian [ph] for financial.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for full year 2020 and 2021. Our backlog level at the end of the third quarter of 2020 was $1.43 billion. Sequentially, our backlog decreased by $103 million. Same-store backlog compared to one year ago has decreased by $271 million of which $145 million related to our electrical segment. Changes in backlog include the effects of the third quarter seasonality and an expected decline in our electrical segment, but we are also experiencing delays in bookings and in project starts at certain of our large project companies. Most of our sectors continued to have strong quotation activity even in the sectors where bookings have been delayed. That is particularly true in our industrial business, which includes technology, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and food processing. Our industrial revenue has grown to 39% of total revenue in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 31% a year ago. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and the government were 36% of our revenue and that is roughly consistent with what we saw in 2019. The commercial sector was 25% of our revenue. For 2020, construction is 79% of our total revenue with 48% from construction projects for new buildings and 31% from construction projects in existing buildings. Both of our construction and service businesses achieved record operating income margin. Service is 21% of our revenue year-to-date with service projects providing 8% of revenue and pure service including hourly work providing 13% of revenue. Beginning in late March, our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impacts associated with COVID-19 largely as a result of building closures or decisions by customers to limit building access. However, during this quarter, we saw our service operations at or very near pre-pandemic levels with improved profitability. Fortunately, our construction activities continue to be classified as essential services in most markets. Despite pandemic related challenges, our mechanical segment performed incredibly well during the quarter. We are grateful for our performance this year and our prospects are much better than we would have expected this past spring. Finally, I'm going to take a few minutes and comment on our outlook. I have never experienced a more uncertain environment and frankly, a broad range of outcomes are possible in the intermediate one to two-year timeframe. It is not currently possible to predict with any confidence how the pandemic and related government decisions will unfold. No other pandemic may impact the decisions of our customers. With that in mind, we are currently seeing both delays and high levels of pipeline activity at the same time, which is unusual. We expect our full-year 2020 results will significantly surpass our record results in 2019. Although, as Bill mentioned, we also currently expect that same-store revenue headwinds, especially in our electrical segment will lead to same-store revenue declines in the fourth quarter and through the first half of next year. Nevertheless, given the range of conditions that we foresee we feel confident of solid profitability and cash flow in 2021. Although we expect that 2021 earnings will not match our extraordinary 2020 earnings. Given uncertainties related to the ongoing pandemic and the evidence of delays in bookings and project starts, we expect incremental challenges during the first half of 2021 including air pockets in some markets and we are preparing for a broad range of possible economic and capital investment environment in 2021 and in 2022. Our growth in the industrial segments of technology, medical and pharmaceutical, give us a good opportunity to cope with any challenges successfully. We believe that whatever the puts and takes are over the next several quarters, we have an unmatched workforce and a great and necessary business and that we are very well positioned in geographic markets and industry verticals with solvent ongoing prospects. We plan to continue to invest to make the most of these advantages and opportunities. Thank you once again to our employees for your hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Sheila for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of DA Davidson. Please proceed.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, thank you. Good morning.\nBill George: Hey, good morning, Brent, how are you?\nBrent Thielman: I'm doing well. Thanks. Hey, Brian, or Will, I guess on that the mechanical margins, I mean they are really extraordinarily strong this year, chalk it up to really good execution. I know you've had that kind of a service headwind, which is usually pretty good for margins. I guess how do you feel about sustaining these sorts of levels? I guess I'm thinking [indiscernible] but sort of sustaining these levels with potentially some topline pullback.\nBill George: Yes, I mean I'll go first. If you look at service made a tremendous recovery in the second - third quarter, which produced the highest margins we've ever, we see at other of our service business since Comfort started and on the construction front, is what you said that we just had really exceptional execution. I think we will continue to execute at a high level, the service business is still there. We did over 20% gross margins in it. I still see us in the 19% to 20% range, Brent, as we go forward even with a revenue decline.\nBrian Lane: I couldn't agree more.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. I mean and is that structurally higher than what you've been in the past. So I mean that's, yes, that's what I was trying to get to. It's kind of what normal [indiscernible].\nBill George: It's higher than where we then, except for the recent past; yes.\nBrent Thielman: Right.\nBill George: You'll - for five years, we've been pretty consistently in that 19 to 20, 21 range, Brent, pretty consistent.\nBrian Lane: We do have a lot more industrial right now. So some of that is just in that and with service coming back and we're talking about mechanical margins. We felt good about those gross profit margins for mechanical opening up.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. And then on the electrical side, it sounds like part of that, the backlog creep lower is maybe one-part market, one part, deliver it. I know you guys are kind of out looking to pursue maybe higher-value work. How quickly do you think you can push these margins back up within that segment, you made a little bit of progress here this quarter, I'm just wondering if you think you can continue that?\nBill George: One thing, although it's unfortunate in a sense that our revenue is, so our revenue is going down, some of that was certainly planned and expected in summer we simply expected because we had a big bulge on some of our, some of the biggest work we ever had performed from the third quarter of last year until about middle of the second quarter of this year. They had just some giant jobs. Having said that, the other side of that the margin side of that even though it will have a lower revenue is that was very that was fee-based work and we had very low gross margins sort of as far as an averaging effect goes. So actually we will get help on the electrical margins just by the change in mix, so we'll get a lot up on volume, but we'll get them back on rate and electrical.\nBrian Lane: And also the service part of electrical was basically zero in March, but it has made particularly in the low voltage side a terrific come back in the third quarter and continues to gain momentum, Brett. So that's clearly, I mean the margins are a lot higher and the electrical service side as well.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Maybe one last one, a bigger picture question, you guys are all across the country, where are you seeing some of the particular air pockets that you talk about and where are the areas where the pipeline still looks pretty robust. And you're still seeing pretty good award activity, curious what you're seeing across the, across the country.\nBrian Lane: Yes. So, Brent, it's Brian. I'll give you some pretty broad strokes. I think you see in most of it up in the north, in general. I think in the south, we're still seeing probably a little bit more activity than we're seeing up there. Have some delays but I'm getting a little bit more positive feedback down here where we are, that some of this works going to go, maybe a little sooner. That is up north whatever the reasons are, I think there is a little bit different view between the Northeast and the south, for sure. Bill, do you have anything on that?\nBill George: No doubt that there is simply more stuff just shut down in the Northeast, right. And to get work started it doesn't just take somebody willing to do it, there's things that have to happen. You have to have drainage plans, you have to permits and you have to have all sorts of engineering done and soil and so with things have been shut down delayed government offices. It doesn't take much to create these delays because there is a critical path and a lot of things are on the critical path. If you're going to build something as complex as a big, big building. So in the Northeast there's is a lot more of that, the south it's more business as usual from the point of view of at least support.\nBrent Thielman: Got it, okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thank you, Brett.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman of KeyBank Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. Good morning, guys. Just going back to sort of this delayed bookings and Starr's dynamic, we kind of covered the geographic perspective, but just curious from an end market perspective and project size, just how broad-based is this dynamic, I guess across end markets.\nBill George: So there is at least one example of a big data center that's delayed, but in general, I'd say it's broad-based, Brian.\nBrian Lane: I think it's pretty broad-based. Projects over 10 for sure we're seeing delays to smaller projects.\nBill George: Still pretty much going, Sean.\nBrian Lane: And the geography, you got to go back to the geographies.\nSean Eastman: Yes, got you. Okay. I hate to belabor the point on margins. We went through that in detail already, but I just wonder about this sort of unusual dynamic to use your words, where you've got this really healthy prospect pipeline but not totally sure on when the work is going again. How do you manage through that dynamic and do we expect sort of an immediate term margin drag as you do sort of stay positioned around what seems to be still a really healthy amount of work coming out imminently?\nBill George: Yes, Sean. That's a really good question and I've checked on that in the last few days, and in the general statement, most of the stuff we're looking at, we are holding margins and we haven't had conversations about a big decrease in that at all. How we're going to manage it going forward, it is the same way you manage any construction activity when the work slows down, you have to reduce your costs, hopefully, it's temporary. But you don't have to manage the labor according to what the workload is. I know these guys have done it before, we don't have any work is out there to evolve. For the first time I've seen this much bidding activity with delays like this, but in terms of the fluctuations of the cyclicality of it, we've all been through this before,\nBrian Lane: So with the bidding activity, there is no sense that we shouldn't - we don't have a sense that we should be congratulating on right now get where something else is going to have to happen for that to start.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Alright, that's helpful. And last, one from me is the cash flow clearly a bright spot in 2020. The balance sheet, it looks like it's ready for another acquisition. How should we - how should we be thinking about our capital deployment in the coming quarters?\nBill George: So I would say absolutely we have paid off a year's worth of EBITDA a year sooner than we thought we would. So yes, it has to make you more open-minded to acquisitions. Having said that anything we do will be done with a ton of conviction because of all the uncertainty. What Brian Lane says this is the most uncertainty we've ever seen, as you might imagine that also plays into the timing for acquisitions. But there are, as you know, we talked to companies for years and sometimes a decade and if the company we have conviction about is ready to sell, we are ready to buy it. I think. So we just, we don't really do a quote at Comfort Systems, right, we buy companies we think will make us better for decades forever.\nBrian Lane: But if we do find good companies. We will do them, Sean.\nSean Eastman: Okay, got you. All right, guys, I appreciate the insight. Thanks very much and I compliment the team on this year to date execution, very impressive.\nBrian Lane: Thanks, Sean. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please go ahead\nAdam Thalhimer: Good morning, guys. Congrats on a record quarter.\nBrian Lane: Hey, Adam. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.\nAdam Thalhimer: Brian, I'm trying to parse through your comments on the bidding, because you said that - I think you said the bidding is still strong, I guess at industrial, what are you seeing within the institutional and commercial markets.\nBrian Lane: So yes, I mean, if so, run dormant specifics, obviously hotels are pretty quiet at the moment. Commercial buildings, for the most part, right, people are gone back to use them, they are pretty slow. Our backlog in education is still, we're pretty good, actually still looking at some work and of course air quality, it doesn't go into backlog, but we are doing some work in schools on that front. So we're not expecting to see hotels or office buildings in here in the near future. Bill, do you want to.\nBill George: Yes, you know. Meanwhile, the intermediate-term prospects for pharma are very good, like in the Mid-Atlantic and then food processing is always - it's always good. Manufacturing, there is really good indications, but they're just not finding a piece of paper and starting. If you think about it, we're facing a lot of uncertainty over the next several weeks and months, right. So why would anybody you kind of have to understand like why somebody would they keep doing work on it, but whether the delay in signing a contract can't be too surprising to anybody right now. If you're a hospital, for example, you'll find out who is going to run health and human services in the next few weeks that matters, if you're a pharma, you're going to find out who is running the FDA, one way or another, in the next couple of months and they're just why would I don't know, I think it's understandable.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And I'm not sure if it's a fair question. I mean I think it's more the virus or the election, right now?\nBrian Lane: I'll let Bill answer that one.\nBill George: I think it's a general level of uncertainty, but I would say, it's an equal part, I think it's definitely both.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And not looking for specific guidance, but I mean, what are the range of expectations for how the backlog might trend?\nBrian Lane: So as far as how the backlog might trend that is really lumpy like, I think it's going to be hard to be signing. We have a very high standard before we will put something in the backlog and it's going to be hard for us to get firm signatures by now at the end of the year. I think the real tell will be it by the time the winners over by the time we report the first quarter. Well, we, where we see our backlog stabilize and start to pick up by year-end, not so much and as far as revenue growth. So we think big job we had is on electrical, the biggest revenue quarter for the jobs we had in electrical was the fourth quarter of last year. So electrical you may, if you look at, was up like $30 million, I think from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of last year. So we have a really big electrical backlog comparison exacerbated by these delays for the fourth quarter, so that's going to make same-store revenue overall down for sure in the fourth quarter. And then with a bias towards down in the first and second quarter just because that big work isn't there some of that was planned and some of it has come to pass. So I don't know if that's helpful. But that's what I know.\nAdam Thalhimer: No, that's very helpful. And then the last one from me. Bill, I wanted to ask on D and A because it came in almost $3 million sequentially. Just curious on what the puts and takes are for the next few quarters.\nBill George: So there are several different kinds of [indiscernible]; I think we're talking about amortization, right? There are several different kinds of amortization, that is the stuff that goes through SG&A and that is coming down. And then there is the backlog, the backlog amortization for our TIS acquisition is the fastest we've ever had it. So you've got, you may help. So with Walker, you had amortization coming down over about an 18 to 24-month period for their backlog. TAS is because, the stuff is built in a plant, their backlog whatever they have on a given day, it all burns in the next three, four, five months. So that's why you're seeing a big drop. The good news is you don't have to wonder about this. If you go to page, I think around page 18, we put a table there, that shows amortization for the coming years. So we show you the amortization for the last quarter of this year and then we show you the amortization for the next four years and with that something you're required by the rules to put in once a year. We put - we put it in each quarter when we're doing when there's craziness going on. So you can just go look that up and put it right in your model, not wanted to change we do another acquisition, there'll be amortization for that acquisition. But if we didn't do another acquisition absent an unlikely impairment as these kind of assets are very hard to impair even if you want to do, that math, you can just. You got it Page 18.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Perfect. I'll turn it over. Thanks guys.\nBrian Lane: All right. Take care, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, Brian. Bill and Julie, can you guys hear me?\nBrian Lane: Yes, we can hear you absolutely.\nUnidentified Analyst: Fantastic. Glad you take the calls. Just following up, it seems like your core operations on the mechanical side you've done really well, and kudos to you for doing it. Looking at the acquisitions, I think you walked us through a little bit Walker, kind of the air pocket and inability to maybe fill in the pipeline, but the way they expected it, but if I look at TAS it seems like sequentially we are down 50% and here and Starr Electric I think around 20. So, maybe first question, you can kind of talk a little bit about not the nature of the business, because I thought you talked about it, but maybe specifically on that modular business, is there something specific about the type of the business they're doing or is there something about the end markets that really created the pockets - air pockets for those two.\nBill George: So for TAS, that's the one that's not likely, but we already really told you everything we have about Walker. For TAS, they had a very, very big second quarter revenue wise, it was like 50 plus million and they've had more like 29 or 30 million in the third quarter, so 50 plus million. So they manufacture things in the plant and in the plant, they had a gigantic order going out and they had big equipment deliveries in the second quarter. Here's the thing about and then in the third quarter, they didn't have those equipment deliveries and I think that they'll probably have another similar quarter in the fourth quarter and it will pick up next year just based on the order book, it will pick up back let's say, there's a good chance that it will pick up a lot next year, but at the end of the day, none of that is really impacting our numbers very much, because we have what's called a WIP adjustment and we have where things that are ongoing on the day we buy them, we do a make [indiscernible]. So it's one of the reasons we don't talk about it a lot in the script as it's not, it's not huge in the quarter. You may have seen for example that we picked up money through the earn outline, a significant $3 or $4 million, I think through the earn outline this quarter, we gave back a similar amount in the last little while through what's called the WIP adjustment line. So that's why we don't mention it because it kind of washes out. But as far as the prospects, we think we like the prospects for next year and so compared to Walker where we definitely have an air pocket, we don't really - we don't really foresee that with TAS and we'll start to get more benefit from TAS, next year because as I said their amortization was very, very heavy, early on, for this backlog amortization because of how fast their backlog burns.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. So, then going - keeping that in mind, and I'm assuming similar commentary about Starr Electric would play in, if I look at your kind of the broad guidance you gave us on the same-store sales in December 2020 and the first half of 2021. I think it's a fair question to ask, what is the core mechanical look like? So if I was to take the TAS and you were looking forward for that core mechanical business kind of what are your expectations there?\nBill George: In the fourth quarter, we are looking at low to mid-single-digit improvement, with COVID, they were flat this quarter mechanical was flat. I actually was, I thought it might be down slightly and I think there is a bias towards mechanical being a little bit down for the next two or three quarters for to say, Starr, I'm sorry, electrical will be down a lot because it's comparing to gigantic quarters a year ago. So, and year-over-year but as far as mechanical, I'd say it will round to zero. They won't get the growth we were hoping for, but I don't see signs of that shrinking or anything, electrical is down there. The reason we put in our script that we have same-store revenue declines as electrical.\nUnidentified Analyst: And I'm really glad to hear that because it sounds like the core business with the HVAC heating and plumbing, it's doing well and it should give you some confidence in going forward. So my thought was here and going maybe to the Board as well if the core business is doing well and acquisitions are really in adjacencies, we should say, if maybe these recent acquisitions, there are somewhat adjacent to your core business, maybe there is a different way to look at them going forward. And then really compare them to the cost of your own shares and maybe being more aggressive in stock buybacks because it seems to me that your bar should be a little bit higher for the businesses that are in adjacencies than making acquisitions in your core business. And if that's the case maybe there is a better use of capital. Looking at your business, best your own business in your own shares.\nBrian Lane: So we're pretty aggressive at buying back shares. But we also, when we do these acquisitions, we have a lot of conviction about them. So for example, when we bought EAS five or six years ago, we had the exact same people, the exact same argument why you should have been buying shares you are only getting 5 or 10 million a year from them, but for the last - we've got $10 million a quarter from them. So we believe these acquisitions are going that we're going to be very happy to have thousand licensed electricians, we might be wrong about that but the other thing is when we buy our shares when we think the share price is good, we tend to only buy our shares until we start to affect the price. We're not a company that wants to build up our stock. So we that's just a conviction we have, we buy our shares. I don't know. We bought back nine million shares and we will continue to buy shares.\nUnidentified Analyst: I understand. Will, I think I agree with you, I think, the acquisitions in your core business, they've done better. And you've done better, but I just question if the bar shouldn't be higher for these adjacent businesses. And if that is the case, I think your perspective changes a little bit. Obviously, barring seeing more acquisitions in your HVAC business I should put that way. Assuming like you said - like you said your leverage has been lowered substantially and it's going to come to the question of what do you do with that capital and if there is a lot of acquisitions in the core business, I think it's obviously easier decision to make.\nBrian Lane: All right.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. But thank you. Thank you for the results, and I know there are difficult times out there, and I agree with you, I think in the next few weeks, we may know more and actually business may look quite interesting.\nBrian Lane: Fingers crossed. All right, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much. We have no more questions. And I would like to turn the call over to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right, in closing, I want once again to thank all of our wonderful employees. The results our team has accomplished this quarter were truly amazing. I have never felt better about this company and its future. We are looking forward to seeing many of you again in person, but in the meanwhile, please be safe. Thanks, and take care.\nOperator: Thank you so much. And everyone that now concludes the call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining.",

            "name": "Brian Lane",
            "content": "Okay, thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We are all facing unique challenges now from the global pandemic and in the midst of that, we appreciate our good performance and solid prospects. More than anything, I am grateful for our employees and I want to thank all of them for their commitment and resilience during this difficult time. Our employees continue to rise to the occasion, I feel gratitude and admiration for them every day. We are working hard to keep our workforce and our community safe and healthy during COVID-19. Despite adversity, Comfort Systems USA achieved record earnings and impressive cash flow. We earned $1.36 per share this quarter compared to $0.98 per share in the same quarter of last year. This quarter included a $0.17 benefit from a discrete tax item. This marks the highest quarterly EPS in the history of our company with all [ph] it out the tax benefit. Revenues was $714 million for the quarter and our year-to-date revenues exceed $2.1 billion. Through nine months, we had $199 million of free cash flow more than double the good results we achieved in the same time frame last year. Our backlog has trended downwards on this quarter, but we feel good about our prospects. And as you can see, we continue to increase our dividend. In a few minutes, I will spend some time on how that might affect us next year. Before I review our operational results and prospects. I want to ask Bill to review the details of our financial performance. Bill? Okay. Thanks, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for full year 2020 and 2021. Our backlog level at the end of the third quarter of 2020 was $1.43 billion. Sequentially, our backlog decreased by $103 million. Same-store backlog compared to one year ago has decreased by $271 million of which $145 million related to our electrical segment. Changes in backlog include the effects of the third quarter seasonality and an expected decline in our electrical segment, but we are also experiencing delays in bookings and in project starts at certain of our large project companies. Most of our sectors continued to have strong quotation activity even in the sectors where bookings have been delayed. That is particularly true in our industrial business, which includes technology, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, and food processing. Our industrial revenue has grown to 39% of total revenue in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 31% a year ago. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and the government were 36% of our revenue and that is roughly consistent with what we saw in 2019. The commercial sector was 25% of our revenue. For 2020, construction is 79% of our total revenue with 48% from construction projects for new buildings and 31% from construction projects in existing buildings. Both of our construction and service businesses achieved record operating income margin. Service is 21% of our revenue year-to-date with service projects providing 8% of revenue and pure service including hourly work providing 13% of revenue. Beginning in late March, our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impacts associated with COVID-19 largely as a result of building closures or decisions by customers to limit building access. However, during this quarter, we saw our service operations at or very near pre-pandemic levels with improved profitability. Fortunately, our construction activities continue to be classified as essential services in most markets. Despite pandemic related challenges, our mechanical segment performed incredibly well during the quarter. We are grateful for our performance this year and our prospects are much better than we would have expected this past spring. Finally, I'm going to take a few minutes and comment on our outlook. I have never experienced a more uncertain environment and frankly, a broad range of outcomes are possible in the intermediate one to two-year timeframe. It is not currently possible to predict with any confidence how the pandemic and related government decisions will unfold. No other pandemic may impact the decisions of our customers. With that in mind, we are currently seeing both delays and high levels of pipeline activity at the same time, which is unusual. We expect our full-year 2020 results will significantly surpass our record results in 2019. Although, as Bill mentioned, we also currently expect that same-store revenue headwinds, especially in our electrical segment will lead to same-store revenue declines in the fourth quarter and through the first half of next year. Nevertheless, given the range of conditions that we foresee we feel confident of solid profitability and cash flow in 2021. Although we expect that 2021 earnings will not match our extraordinary 2020 earnings. Given uncertainties related to the ongoing pandemic and the evidence of delays in bookings and project starts, we expect incremental challenges during the first half of 2021 including air pockets in some markets and we are preparing for a broad range of possible economic and capital investment environment in 2021 and in 2022. Our growth in the industrial segments of technology, medical and pharmaceutical, give us a good opportunity to cope with any challenges successfully. We believe that whatever the puts and takes are over the next several quarters, we have an unmatched workforce and a great and necessary business and that we are very well positioned in geographic markets and industry verticals with solvent ongoing prospects. We plan to continue to invest to make the most of these advantages and opportunities. Thank you once again to our employees for your hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Sheila for questions. Thank you. I couldn't agree more. We do have a lot more industrial right now. So some of that is just in that and with service coming back and we're talking about mechanical margins. We felt good about those gross profit margins for mechanical opening up. And also the service part of electrical was basically zero in March, but it has made particularly in the low voltage side a terrific come back in the third quarter and continues to gain momentum, Brett. So that's clearly, I mean the margins are a lot higher and the electrical service side as well. Yes. So, Brent, it's Brian. I'll give you some pretty broad strokes. I think you see in most of it up in the north, in general. I think in the south, we're still seeing probably a little bit more activity than we're seeing up there. Have some delays but I'm getting a little bit more positive feedback down here where we are, that some of this works going to go, maybe a little sooner. That is up north whatever the reasons are, I think there is a little bit different view between the Northeast and the south, for sure. Bill, do you have anything on that? All right. Thank you, Brett. I think it's pretty broad-based. Projects over 10 for sure we're seeing delays to smaller projects. And the geography, you got to go back to the geographies. So with the bidding activity, there is no sense that we shouldn't - we don't have a sense that we should be congratulating on right now get where something else is going to have to happen for that to start. But if we do find good companies. We will do them, Sean. Thanks, Sean. Appreciate it. Hey, Adam. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. So yes, I mean, if so, run dormant specifics, obviously hotels are pretty quiet at the moment. Commercial buildings, for the most part, right, people are gone back to use them, they are pretty slow. Our backlog in education is still, we're pretty good, actually still looking at some work and of course air quality, it doesn't go into backlog, but we are doing some work in schools on that front. So we're not expecting to see hotels or office buildings in here in the near future. Bill, do you want to. I'll let Bill answer that one. So as far as how the backlog might trend that is really lumpy like, I think it's going to be hard to be signing. We have a very high standard before we will put something in the backlog and it's going to be hard for us to get firm signatures by now at the end of the year. I think the real tell will be it by the time the winners over by the time we report the first quarter. Well, we, where we see our backlog stabilize and start to pick up by year-end, not so much and as far as revenue growth. So we think big job we had is on electrical, the biggest revenue quarter for the jobs we had in electrical was the fourth quarter of last year. So electrical you may, if you look at, was up like $30 million, I think from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of last year. So we have a really big electrical backlog comparison exacerbated by these delays for the fourth quarter, so that's going to make same-store revenue overall down for sure in the fourth quarter. And then with a bias towards down in the first and second quarter just because that big work isn't there some of that was planned and some of it has come to pass. So I don't know if that's helpful. But that's what I know. All right. Take care, Adam. Yes, we can hear you absolutely. So we're pretty aggressive at buying back shares. But we also, when we do these acquisitions, we have a lot of conviction about them. So for example, when we bought EAS five or six years ago, we had the exact same people, the exact same argument why you should have been buying shares you are only getting 5 or 10 million a year from them, but for the last - we've got $10 million a quarter from them. So we believe these acquisitions are going that we're going to be very happy to have thousand licensed electricians, we might be wrong about that but the other thing is when we buy our shares when we think the share price is good, we tend to only buy our shares until we start to affect the price. We're not a company that wants to build up our stock. So we that's just a conviction we have, we buy our shares. I don't know. We bought back nine million shares and we will continue to buy shares. All right. Fingers crossed. All right, thank you. All right, in closing, I want once again to thank all of our wonderful employees. The results our team has accomplished this quarter were truly amazing. I have never felt better about this company and its future. We are looking forward to seeing many of you again in person, but in the meanwhile, please be safe. Thanks, and take care."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. As Brian said, we once again achieved record positive results. Revenue in the third quarter was $714 million, an increase of $7 million compared to the same quarter last year. This increase is due to the current year acquisitions of TAS and Starr, both of which contributed to our expanding modular construction offering. This increase was offset by a decrease in same-store revenue of 6%. Our mechanical segment was up slightly on a same-store basis. So the decrease resulted from lower volume in our electrical services segment due to a combination of very high revenue comparisons in the prior year combined with deferred starts and other delays this year. Last year we experienced very high revenues in electrical as we were mobilized on certain exceptionally large jobs from the second half of 2019 until the middle of this year. As a result of these factors, we will continue to face tough revenue comparisons in electrical through the first half of next year. And combined with the air pockets and delays that we are currently experiencing, we expect continuing same-store revenue headwinds during the second quarter of next year, especially in our two largest Texas markets. Gross profit was $147 million for the third quarter of 2020, a 3% increase compared to last year. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue rose to 20.6% in the third quarter of 2020 compared to 20.2% for the third quarter of 2019. SG&A expense was $91 million for the third quarter of 2020 compared to $90 million for the third quarter of 2019. SG&A as a percentage of revenue remained steady at 12.7% for both quarters. On a same-store basis, SG&A declined $4 million. This decrease is primarily due to cost control measures such as reduction in travel-related expenses. During the third quarter of 2020, we had an increase in tax planning and consulting fees of approximately $2 million which partially offset other declines. Our quarter-to-date effective rate was 14.2% for tax and benefited from R&D credits and energy-efficient commercial building deductions that were previously reserved. During the third quarter, we finalized settlements with the IRS from their examination of our amended federal tax returns for 2014 and 2015. We currently estimate our effective tax rate for the full year 2020 will be between 22% and 25%, which reflects these settlements. Starting in 2021, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 25% and 30% and if you eliminate the benefits of the settlement, our quarterly tax rate this quarter would have been slightly over 28%. Although 2014 and 2015 are now settled, we have open processes ongoing for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years. And while future benefits are possible, we believe any benefits that arise from those years will most likely be recognizable in 2022 or beyond. Net income for the third quarter of 2020 was $50 million or $1.36 per share as compared to $36 million or $0.98 per share in 2019. Earnings per share for the current quarter included $0.17 related to the tax benefit that I previously discussed and that benefited net of related tax consulting fees of $2.8 million that were incurred during the quarter. Even if you completely exclude the tax benefit, we had a 21% increase in earnings per share. For the third quarter, EBITDA was $72 million, an increase of 8% compared to the $66 million of EBITDA that we reported in the third quarter of last year. Our trailing 12-month EBITDA is a record $246 million. Coming up an extraordinary cash flow in the last quarter, our free cash flow continues to be strong and was $48 million in the current quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow was $199 million compared to $79 million in 2019. Our nine months' cash flow includes roughly $20 million of benefit that is a direct result of the federal stimulus bill, which allowed us to defer certain payroll tax payments in the second and third quarter. Our best estimate is that the discrete tax provisions will benefit fourth quarter cash flow by approximately $10 million. This estimated $30 million of full-year 2020 cash flow benefit from these tax provisions will be repaid to the federal government in two equal installments in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022. The phenomenal cash flow this year has resulted in two important balance sheet accomplishments; first, we were able to reduce our leverage to less than 1 turn of trailing 12-month EBITDA about a year sooner than we had anticipated. Second, during the second quarter of 2020, we funded our second largest acquisition ever. However, we were able to fund that acquisition entirely from free cash flow during the quarter, and we still managed to reduce our debt levels. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow is $233 million. Since the beginning of this year, we have purchased 448,000 of our shares at an average price of $41.90. Since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back over nine million shares at an average price of $18.89. Now to Brian [ph] for financial. Hey, good morning, Brent, how are you? Yes, I mean I'll go first. If you look at service made a tremendous recovery in the second - third quarter, which produced the highest margins we've ever, we see at other of our service business since Comfort started and on the construction front, is what you said that we just had really exceptional execution. I think we will continue to execute at a high level, the service business is still there. We did over 20% gross margins in it. I still see us in the 19% to 20% range, Brent, as we go forward even with a revenue decline. It's higher than where we then, except for the recent past; yes. You'll - for five years, we've been pretty consistently in that 19 to 20, 21 range, Brent, pretty consistent. One thing, although it's unfortunate in a sense that our revenue is, so our revenue is going down, some of that was certainly planned and expected in summer we simply expected because we had a big bulge on some of our, some of the biggest work we ever had performed from the third quarter of last year until about middle of the second quarter of this year. They had just some giant jobs. Having said that, the other side of that the margin side of that even though it will have a lower revenue is that was very that was fee-based work and we had very low gross margins sort of as far as an averaging effect goes. So actually we will get help on the electrical margins just by the change in mix, so we'll get a lot up on volume, but we'll get them back on rate and electrical. No doubt that there is simply more stuff just shut down in the Northeast, right. And to get work started it doesn't just take somebody willing to do it, there's things that have to happen. You have to have drainage plans, you have to permits and you have to have all sorts of engineering done and soil and so with things have been shut down delayed government offices. It doesn't take much to create these delays because there is a critical path and a lot of things are on the critical path. If you're going to build something as complex as a big, big building. So in the Northeast there's is a lot more of that, the south it's more business as usual from the point of view of at least support. So there is at least one example of a big data center that's delayed, but in general, I'd say it's broad-based, Brian. Still pretty much going, Sean. Yes, Sean. That's a really good question and I've checked on that in the last few days, and in the general statement, most of the stuff we're looking at, we are holding margins and we haven't had conversations about a big decrease in that at all. How we're going to manage it going forward, it is the same way you manage any construction activity when the work slows down, you have to reduce your costs, hopefully, it's temporary. But you don't have to manage the labor according to what the workload is. I know these guys have done it before, we don't have any work is out there to evolve. For the first time I've seen this much bidding activity with delays like this, but in terms of the fluctuations of the cyclicality of it, we've all been through this before, So I would say absolutely we have paid off a year's worth of EBITDA a year sooner than we thought we would. So yes, it has to make you more open-minded to acquisitions. Having said that anything we do will be done with a ton of conviction because of all the uncertainty. What Brian Lane says this is the most uncertainty we've ever seen, as you might imagine that also plays into the timing for acquisitions. But there are, as you know, we talked to companies for years and sometimes a decade and if the company we have conviction about is ready to sell, we are ready to buy it. I think. So we just, we don't really do a quote at Comfort Systems, right, we buy companies we think will make us better for decades forever. Yes, you know. Meanwhile, the intermediate-term prospects for pharma are very good, like in the Mid-Atlantic and then food processing is always - it's always good. Manufacturing, there is really good indications, but they're just not finding a piece of paper and starting. If you think about it, we're facing a lot of uncertainty over the next several weeks and months, right. So why would anybody you kind of have to understand like why somebody would they keep doing work on it, but whether the delay in signing a contract can't be too surprising to anybody right now. If you're a hospital, for example, you'll find out who is going to run health and human services in the next few weeks that matters, if you're a pharma, you're going to find out who is running the FDA, one way or another, in the next couple of months and they're just why would I don't know, I think it's understandable. I think it's a general level of uncertainty, but I would say, it's an equal part, I think it's definitely both. So there are several different kinds of [indiscernible]; I think we're talking about amortization, right? There are several different kinds of amortization, that is the stuff that goes through SG&A and that is coming down. And then there is the backlog, the backlog amortization for our TIS acquisition is the fastest we've ever had it. So you've got, you may help. So with Walker, you had amortization coming down over about an 18 to 24-month period for their backlog. TAS is because, the stuff is built in a plant, their backlog whatever they have on a given day, it all burns in the next three, four, five months. So that's why you're seeing a big drop. The good news is you don't have to wonder about this. If you go to page, I think around page 18, we put a table there, that shows amortization for the coming years. So we show you the amortization for the last quarter of this year and then we show you the amortization for the next four years and with that something you're required by the rules to put in once a year. We put - we put it in each quarter when we're doing when there's craziness going on. So you can just go look that up and put it right in your model, not wanted to change we do another acquisition, there'll be amortization for that acquisition. But if we didn't do another acquisition absent an unlikely impairment as these kind of assets are very hard to impair even if you want to do, that math, you can just. You got it Page 18. So for TAS, that's the one that's not likely, but we already really told you everything we have about Walker. For TAS, they had a very, very big second quarter revenue wise, it was like 50 plus million and they've had more like 29 or 30 million in the third quarter, so 50 plus million. So they manufacture things in the plant and in the plant, they had a gigantic order going out and they had big equipment deliveries in the second quarter. Here's the thing about and then in the third quarter, they didn't have those equipment deliveries and I think that they'll probably have another similar quarter in the fourth quarter and it will pick up next year just based on the order book, it will pick up back let's say, there's a good chance that it will pick up a lot next year, but at the end of the day, none of that is really impacting our numbers very much, because we have what's called a WIP adjustment and we have where things that are ongoing on the day we buy them, we do a make [indiscernible]. So it's one of the reasons we don't talk about it a lot in the script as it's not, it's not huge in the quarter. You may have seen for example that we picked up money through the earn outline, a significant $3 or $4 million, I think through the earn outline this quarter, we gave back a similar amount in the last little while through what's called the WIP adjustment line. So that's why we don't mention it because it kind of washes out. But as far as the prospects, we think we like the prospects for next year and so compared to Walker where we definitely have an air pocket, we don't really - we don't really foresee that with TAS and we'll start to get more benefit from TAS, next year because as I said their amortization was very, very heavy, early on, for this backlog amortization because of how fast their backlog burns. In the fourth quarter, we are looking at low to mid-single-digit improvement, with COVID, they were flat this quarter mechanical was flat. I actually was, I thought it might be down slightly and I think there is a bias towards mechanical being a little bit down for the next two or three quarters for to say, Starr, I'm sorry, electrical will be down a lot because it's comparing to gigantic quarters a year ago. So, and year-over-year but as far as mechanical, I'd say it will round to zero. They won't get the growth we were hoping for, but I don't see signs of that shrinking or anything, electrical is down there. The reason we put in our script that we have same-store revenue declines as electrical."

My name is Steve and I\u2019m your event manager. During the presentation, your lines will remain on listen-only. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d also like to advise all parties, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. And now I\u2019d like to hand over to Julie.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Steve. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings Call. Our comments this morning as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. What we will say today is based on the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties, that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a more detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K, and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release, covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right, thanks, Julie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. More than ever, I want to start this call by sincerely thanking all of our Comfort Systems USA employees for their work and commitment and especially their courage and resilience during this global pandemic. As all of you know, these are challenging times. But our employees are rising to the occasion. And I feel gratitude and admiration for them every day. We continue to focus on keeping our employees and our communities safe. We employ CDC and OSHA guidelines to ensure our workforce and our community is kept safe and healthy during COVID-19. And we are taking many other actions. In local markets, we have implemented the measures we feel are best suited to local circumstances, such as segmented work zones, staggered start time, temperature and symptom screening, disinfecting equipments and work areas, distancing and the wearing of protective face and nose personal protective equipment. We operate in numerous markets in dozens of states and our leadership in each location is conforming to the measures that are required locally and seeking the path that will work best to keep our people safe and well. That is a true strength of Comfort Systems. In the midst of these challenges, Comfort Systems USA achieved great earnings and extraordinary cash flow this quarter. We earned a $1.08 per share this quarter compared to $0.65 per share in the same quarter of last year. The $1.08 of earnings per share this quarter is the highest quarterly EPS in the history of our company. Revenues were $743 million compared to $650 million in the prior year. And despite revenue headwinds in service, we grew 2% on a same-store basis. Our cash flow was truly unprecedented as we had over $135 million of free cash flow this quarter. And through six months, we are more than $130 million ahead of the same period in 2019. COVID-19 began impacting our business in the second half of March. Our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impact, largely because of building closures and decisions by customers to limit building access. As of the end of the second quarter, the majority of our service operations have returned to normal activity and functioning. Meanwhile, our construction activities, overall, continued unabated, although individual jobs have experienced temporary closures and curtailments from time to time as a result of positive tests for COVID-19 of workers at various sites. Despite these productivity challenges, our local leadership, project management, and especially our field workers have extraordinarily \u2013 have been extraordinarily effective, exceeding our highest expectations. Our backlog as of June 30, 2020 was $1.53 billion. We maintained a very strong backlog despite a sequential same-store decrease of $133 million or 8% since March 31, 2020. This decrease is primarily composed of seasonal variation plus approximately $60 million of projects that we removed from backlog as a result of adverse effects relating to the pandemic. The majority of the projects we removed from backlog will likely be completed. However, we chose to remove any project that has been paused or is expected to be paused, if there is no specified resumption date. TAS Energy, which we acquired on April 1, is off to a great start. With TAS now a part of Comfort Systems USA and when considered in connection with our existing capabilities at EAS in North Carolina, we now have unmatched capabilities to complete complex modular and off-site construction of MEP assemblies in the growing modular construction industry. Our modular construction offering is particularly strong in the technology, medical and pharmaceutical industries. This combination allows us to cross-sell our capabilities to our existing customer base at all of our locations and augments our already strong industrial segment, which has increased to 40% of total revenues so far this year. I will discuss our business outlook in more detail in a few minutes, but first, let me turn this call over to Bill to review the details of our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George: Thanks, Brian. And what a performance it was. Our results were remarkable this quarter in every aspect. Revenue in the second quarter was $743 million, an increase of $93 million or 14% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily due to the recent acquisition of TAS and Starr, both of which contribute to our expanding modular construction offerings. Same-store revenues were up 2% for the quarter and 4% for the first six months of 2020. The fact that we achieved an overall increase in same-store revenue is notable because our service revenue declined by $18 million year-over-year in the second quarter due to the effects of COVID-related closures especially in April and May. Gross profit was $146 million for the second quarter of 2020, an increase of $26 million or 21% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 19.6% in the second quarter of 2020, compared to 18.5% for the second quarter of 2019. The strong margins on our mechanical construction work this quarter more than offset the lower margins that we experienced in our electrical segment. Our electrical segment, in addition to their large project mix and lower service component, continues to experience more than their share of specific project challenges, including the impact of COVID-19 on productivity and certain purchase adjustments that impact our gross margins. With larger projects and less service, our electrical segment also lowers our SG&A percentage. SG&A expense was $85 million for the second quarter of 2020, which roughly matches the prior year, despite the fact that we\u2019ve added two new operations in the interim. On a same-store basis, SG&A declined by $4.7 million. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.4% in the current quarter compared to 13% in the second quarter of 2019. And we continue to benefit from SG&A leverage, largely due to the electrical segment, which requires lower levels of SG&A, as well as a reduction in certain expenses such as travel, resulting from actions we have taken in light of COVID-19. You may have also noted that we also experienced an $8 million sequential decline in SG&A, which is not a usual pattern for us from the first to the second quarter. This decline was caused by a combination of the cost control measures I just described and also resulted from the fact that the March quarter included $4.6 million of bad debt expense in SG&A of debt related to COVID. We did not take any additional accruals this quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 27.6%, which is right in the middle of our expected range and which compares to 23.9% in the year ago period, when our rate benefited from discrete items. Net income for the second quarter of 2020 was a record $39 million or $1.08 per share as compared to $24 million or $0.65 per share in 2019. This 66% increase in earnings per share is particularly impressive as it was achieved despite COVID-19-related challenges. Our trailing 12-month earnings per share is $3.46, a new record for a 12-month period. For our second quarter, EBITDA was $79 million, an increase of more than 50% as compared to the $50 million of EBITDA that we reported in the second quarter last year. Our trailing 12-month EBITDA is $241 million, a record for Comfort Systems USA by a substantial margin. Cash flow for the quarter was really extraordinary. Our free cash flow was $136 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2019. Our cash flow includes $19 million of benefit that is a direct result of the federal stimulus bill, which allowed us to defer certain payroll and income tax payments in the second quarter. Approximately $8 million of this benefit has already been repaid in July. Our best estimate is that these discrete tax provisions will benefit our third quarter cash flow by a net $2 million to $3 million and will benefit fourth quarter cash flow by $10 million to $11 million. The $30 million to $35 million of cash flow benefit that we expect overall from these tax provisions will be repaid to the federal government in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022. We also had some benefit this quarter from a temporary disinvestment in working capital as our workforce dipped in April and May. However, we believe that much of that benefit has been reabsorbed by the end of June. Even considering these two items, this was a fantastic level of free cash flow in a single quarter. In fact, the extraordinary cash flow this quarter resulted in two remarkable balance sheet accomplishments. First, we were able to reduce our leverage to less than one turn of trailing 12-month EBITDA much earlier than we had anticipated. Second, during the second quarter of 2020, we funded our second largest acquisition ever. However, we were able to fund that acquisition entirely from free cash flow during the quarter, and we still managed to reduce our debt level. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow is $251 million and that represents the highest 12-month free cash flow that we have ever achieved. During the first six months of 2020, we have purchased 290,000 of our shares at an average price of $37.91. And since we began our repurchase program, we have bought back nearly 9 million shares at an average price of $18.36. That\u2019s all I got, Brian.\nBrian Lane: All right, thanks, Bill. I\u2019m going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for full year 2020. Our backlog level is strong and at the end of the second quarter of 2020 was $1.53 billion. During the second quarter of 2020, we removed approximately $60 million of incomplete projects from backlog as a result of adverse effects relating to the pandemic. The majority of the projects we removed will likely be completed. However, we chose to remove any project that has been paused or is expected to be paused if there is no specified resumption date. Same-store backlog compared to one year ago has decreased by $56 million, but that is more than accounted for by the planned and expected decrease at Walker. Without Walker, our year-over-year backlog is actually up by approximately $15 million on a same-store basis. Sequentially, our same-store backlog decreased by $133 million. This decrease is primarily composed of seasonal variations, the removal of certain projects related to COVID, and the decline in our electrical segment. Most sectors have remained strong with particular strength in industrial. Our industrial revenue has grown to 40% of total revenue in the first half of 2020. Institutional markets, which include education, healthcare and government, were 36% of our revenue, which is consistent with what we saw in 2019. The commercial sector was 24% of our revenue. With the acquisition of TAS and Starr Electric, we expect to continue to grow our off-site construction business, particularly in the technology, medical and pharmaceutical industries. For 2020, construction is 80% of our total revenue with 50% from construction projects for new buildings and 30% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service is 20% of our revenue year-to-date with service projects providing 8% of revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 12% of revenue. Beginning in late March, our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impact associated with COVID-19, largely as a result of building closures or decisions by customers to limit building access. This led to a decline in service revenues of 12% in the second quarter of 2020, all related to service calls, maintenance and monitoring. Our project revenues in service this quarter were flat year-over-year. Overall service profit as measured in dollars was roughly the same because we had higher margins in the work that was performed. Although our construction activities have been classified as essential services in most markets, we have had certain jobs temporarily closed due to government actions, decision by owners, or upon positive tests for COVID-19 of workers at various sites. We have also had some delays in the award of new work and we have been informed of instances of delayed starts. These factors create more uncertainty than usual. And we believe that we could experience potential air pockets in future periods. In addition, we have implemented safety precautions and other COVID-19-related guidelines that have added costs or inefficiency as we work to create a safer environment for our team members and our communities. Even with those challenges, our mechanical construction projects performed incredibly well during the quarter. Finally, our outlook. It is not currently possible to quantify the potential impact to our second half of the year or in 2021 because we do not know how the pandemic and related government decisions will unfold, nor how the pandemic may impact the decisions of our customers. Assuming that the pandemic does not materially worsen the economic outlook of our markets, we currently believe that we can achieve full-year 2020 results that are at least comparable to our record results in 2019. We feel that we are well prepared to confront the challenges associated with this pandemic and we believe that our investments in service and our growth in the industrial segments of technology, medical and pharmaceutical give us a good opportunity to cope with these challenges successfully. We are pleased with our prospects. But given uncertainties related to the ongoing pandemic, we continue to prepare for a wide range of economic circumstances over the coming quarters. We have a great workforce and we feel confident that we will continue to make the most of the opportunities in our marketplaces. Thank you once again to our employees for your hard work and dedication. I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Steve for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question come from the line of Joe Mondillo of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nJoe Mondillo: Hi, guys. Good morning.\nBrian Lane: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Mondillo: Could you help us understand how your monthly bookings of new work progressed through the second quarter and into the month of July? Or \u2013 we\u2019re almost done with July, so I\u2019ll let open.\nBill George: Well, so there were very few bookings in April and May, although they rarely are, right, in the rising spring quarter, right when the heavy work is getting started. Last year was an exception. We had a remarkable second quarter bookings season. By June, we got \u2013 we actually had more bookings than usual at June, although that was just the May catch-up. And in July, we continue to book a lot of medium-sized work. There is \u2013 the big work, we haven\u2019t had any big bookings, but we really wouldn\u2019t expect those until late this year, though.\nBrian Lane: And Joe, a lot behind that is general contractors were busy as we were in the second quarter. So, they started opening up opportunities as we go into the back half of the third and the fourth quarters, when you see most of that activity.\nJoe Mondillo: So when you compare it, because there is a seasonal aspect to these, the four-month period that we\u2019re talking about, when you compare it year-over-year, would you say April was the worst year-over-year decline and maybe May stabilized and then you started seeing that year-over-year decline lessen in June and July?\nBill George: Yes, with one caveat. Like a month is such a \u2013 our new bookings are so lumpy and a month is such a short timeframe. That is a little \u2013 it\u2019s a little hard to even talk about trends in months, but I would say it\u2019s actually \u2013 that is pretty much actually true.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay. And I was \u2013 I wanted to ask about the COVID-related benefit that you potentially could see. Where \u2013 what are you hearing? I know you saw a little bit of work in the second quarter. Are you expecting an acceleration of COVID-benefit type projects starting in the third quarter? Any information you can provide in terms of how big of an opportunity this is, the timing of it that would be helpful, because I know a lot of people are thinking about that.\nBrian Lane: Yes, well, it\u2019s a pretty wide range, Joe, as you can imagine. On the construction front, right, we\u2019re pretty optimistic as I probably said four times in my script about pharmaceutical opportunity that we think is going to be coming. We\u2019ve already had a few that we\u2019re working on for a number of customers, and I think that will continue, hopefully, as they get closer to a vaccine and some other therapeutics. But let\u2019s hope and pray for that. On the service front, you get a lot of conversation about air quality. So, we are seeing a lot of opportunities in a lot of buildings of all sorts about how to improve the air in the building from a whole host of options that are out there. So, we\u2019re working with our customers closely about what is the best solution for them. So, I think this is going to keep picking up pace, particularly on the construction front, if they get closer to some kind of medical solution to this pandemic.\nBill George: Yes, we had opportunity. We had an opportunity this quarter where we had to mobilize three companies simultaneously to meet a COVID-related timeframe. We made good money on that, but not material to the results in the quarter. I am most excited about the secular sort of underlying aspects of this. I think that there will be a lot more investment in some of the sectors that we are best at. I think that this has to reinforce reassuring trends over the \u2013 in the coming years. And I also think that in the service side, we have had some sales of things people wanted to do quickly to address workplace safety. But when I talk to people in our controls and service companies, especially some of the more sophisticated offerings we have, they\u2019re most excited about the meetings they\u2019ve been able to get with people that they couldn\u2019t get to in the past, and with the idea that people are going to include these considerations as a much more prominent consideration at some levels in the coming years.\nBrian Lane: But, Joe, overall the service that we provide are crucial to anybody that\u2019s working at home or in a building.\nJoe Mondillo: Great. And just a follow-up on the service aspect of the potential opportunities related to air quality. What \u2013 do you have a sense of sort of timing? Is this sort of a more of an immediate thing? Schools are opening, hopefully going to try to open up in the fall. Is this an immediate opportunity or is this more of a maybe a 2021 kind of more of an opportunity? Do you have a sense of that when you talk to your businesses in the anecdotal stories that you have?\nBill George: Anecdotally, I was talking to one of our best guys and he said, when they went in and gave their first presentation, they were selling a lot of analysis. You go sell and they will come back and do the type of analysis that measure the CO2 in the morning and then measure it in the evening and the CO2 change is a good predictor of how much air exchange there is and how much people are breathing each other\u2019s air. The control companies have a lot of really interesting products. But one of the things he said that was interesting was they put a slide and they realized they needed to put a slide at the front of their deck that said, things you can do today, because he said that they would meet with people and they\u2019d say, \"oh, that\u2019s great, sure, we\u2019ll hire you to do a study, but I would like to write to your PL for something today.\" Now having said that, Comfort Systems is a big company, I don\u2019t think that really materially changes our earnings outlook. Is there nice positive factors? There are lots of very good positive factors for us right now. But I think \u2013 I really do think the more important thing this does is that it puts these considerations front and center, I believe, really on a go-forward basis and that \u2013 and since we are the best, we believe we\u2019re the best there is in this stuff and really, only a few companies around can match us for what we can deploy. We \u2013 that has to help us.\nBrian Lane: And Joe, we\u2019ve done a number of these projects already. You saw our service, as I said in my script, the call-out work was down, but our service project work was the same and some of it\u2019s related to this. So we\u2019re bidding a lot. There\u2019s a lot of opportunities out there. We\u2019re also doing so.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay. And just last question for me. Your SG&A, it\u2019s sort of hard to figure out what was sort of normal, given the challenges that you did see in 2Q outside of all the positive aspects of it and then also TAS. So, I\u2019m wondering what your sort of your normalized SG&A quarterly run rate would be at this point.\nBill George: I think that\u2019s really hard to know right now, but there were math \u2013 there were very important savings from COVID, right, travel stopped. We took \u2013 we had some people for a month or two take voluntary pay cuts. We had cuts that were made in the face of severe concern about just how complete the stoppages that the government was forcing would be. And so I think it\u2019s very hard to say, but I would say our SG&A in the next 18 months or 24 months will be lower than it would have been. But I don\u2019t \u2013 I couldn\u2019t throw out...\nBrian Lane: No, I think, he\u2019s right, Joe. We\u2019re \u2013 as you know, we move very quickly on cost when we need to.\nBill George: In my own model, I have the best odd question for me.\nJoe Mondillo: So, relative to pre-COVID and accounting for TAS, you would still expect SG&A to be sort of lower than pre-COVID.\nBill George: I think so. I think that it\u2019s bound to be \u2013 I mean people...\nBrian Lane: Yes.\nBill George: There are things you\u2019re investing in and you just have to \u2013 you have to focus for a little bit. There is people going through a lot and that\u2019s what you have to focus on.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay, all right. Well, thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it.\nBrian Lane: All right, Joe. Take care.\nBill George: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, thanks. good morning.\nBill George: Hey, Brent.\nBrian Lane: Good morning, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, Brian or Bill, on the $60 million of delayed work, what end markets was that attributable to or was there anything that stood out to you there?\nBill George: More than half was hotels, slightly over half. It\u2019s just exactly what you think, it\u2019s the commercial stuff. If I could \u2013 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any exceptions. There was one cancellation and a bunch of stuff stopped\u2026\nBrian Lane: A lot of it we\u2019ve already started. Yes.\nBill George: They were positive that we\u2019ve already started. The ones we took out of backlog are ones that haven\u2019t yet set a date for restart.\nBrent Thielman: Okay, great. And then the electrical margin, can you give us some sense of when we can think about margins improving there? Can we see that in the second half as some of this legacy work is rolling off, and as you guys kind of focus on doing the wind down of the backlog there? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of when those start to bounce back.\nBill George: Yes. my best estimate is that they\u2019ll start to roll back. I mean, keep in mind, just on a net profit, net cash flow, they are meeting what we expected to meet, but I do think there is upside in the second half for electrical segment margin.\nBrian Lane: Yes, Brent. Walker is a really good company.\nBrent Thielman: Yes, yes. Okay, that\u2019s great. Bill, this might be for you, billings in excess, been a nice kind of net contributor to cash flow in the first six months. I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s driving that. Are you collecting more payments early from customers? Just any color around that.\nBill George: So, we took a hard look \u2013 we went out \u2013 we went to \u2013 obviously, when we thought with cash flow, right, which developed over the course of the quarter, we really thought, okay, we need to dig into and figure out what that is. We think that the biggest parts of it other than the specifics I just gave you, which maybe account for a third of it, those individual issues, a third of the improvement, I guess, will be a better way of putting it. I would say that a lot \u2013 we think it\u2019s more a catch-up than a pull from the future and obviously, if you get this much cash flow in a quarter, you\u2019re doing both right, this much \u2013 this is an \u2013 this would have been a great year for us, really any year. There\u2019s never been a year that this quarter wasn\u2019t been a great year for us and that much less to have that in the second quarter. But in general, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in any particular \u2013 I think the trends there are about what I expect to see continue.\nBrian Lane: Our guys are just very good and the new companies we\u2019ve added are still \u2013 really are as good or better than we are on average at that so.\nBrent Thielman: Got it, okay. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Kevin Gainey from Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.\nKevin Gainey: Good quarter, you guys. Good morning.\nBrian Lane: Hey, Kevin. how are you doing?\nKevin Gainey: Good. I wanted to touch on TAS first. I know that when you guys first bought it, it was 170 to 190 the 55, or 58, 56 in the quarter, what do you see \u2013 how do you see it kind of do in the rest of the year since the original organic revenue forecast is like 5%...\nBill George: Yes. So, they had a big \u2013 they had a big revenue quarter, which you can tease out like you did. Not \u2013 just by 10%, right above, and their revenues like any of our companies are lumpy. They had a couple of really active programs and deliveries in the quarter. They were able to cover really just a massive amount of amortization, because their backlog is a purchased order-based backlog, it turns much more quickly. So, their amortization on backlog was extraordinarily front-loaded like I think more than half of it, in the first quarter, burned. They still managed to make enough money to fully cover everything, every one of those and they were neutral, which is really the main accomplishment, when you look at how much of the intangible they ate out. As far as the rest of the year goes, they will not revenue nearly as heavily in the third or fourth quarter. They right now have really good prospects for a big revenue year next year. But that\u2019s my best estimate.\nKevin Gainey: That works. Next thing I got is on margins. There was good execution in the quarter and typically, there is a seasonal increase going into Q3. Do you kind of see that holding or?\nBill George: Like service?\nBrian Lane: just in general, the gross margin you\u2019re talking about, Kevin?\nKevin Gainey: Yes.\nBrian Lane: I mean, I got to tell you, we\u2019d be thrilled to death if we can match that in the third quarter. That \u2013 the results at 19.6%, we\u2019re executing at an extremely high level in the field.\nBill George: And service is at all-time high profitability as a percentage.\nBrian Lane: Yes.\nBill George: Some of the \u2013 like maintenance and stuff work that we do in service was missing, so that average debt to margins interestingly enough. Some of that will come back, we\u2019ll make net dollars on it, but it would \u2013 service would have a hard time I think matching that percentage in the third quarter. But overall, we think we\u2019ll have very good margins in the third quarter.\nBrian Lane: We\u2019ll be close to...\nBill George: 19.6% is our best guess.\nBrian Lane: But that is a really strong number, though.\nBill George: Yes. I should say. there has never been more uncertainty, right? We have very, very good underlying indications as you\u2019ve \u2013 obviously, we just put in a record quarter. But they\u2019re really \u2013 in my whole time at Comfort, I\u2019ve never seen the same \u2013 this combination of sort of strong underlying indications, but uncertainty for things that are just not within your control.\nKevin Gainey: Yes. And another follow-up. When you\u2019re thinking about \u2013 I know, you\u2019re only halfway through the year, but when you think about 2021 this year, potentially shaping up to be better than 2019, any thoughts on 2021 shaping up being \u2013 to shape up being better than 2020?\nBrian Lane: It\u2019s just too early to tell, Kevin, to give you anything meaningful.\nBill George: We think we\u2019ll make a lot of money in 2021. We\u2019ll not be up against the monster comparable, right. So \u2013 and we \u2013 COVID, right? I mean you want to give me assumptions about vaccines and...\nBrian Lane: Yes.\nBill George: Elections and government decisions and \u2013 it\u2019s the real world, right?\nKevin Gainey: I guess for a final one to, as far as interest, it seems you guys have relatively paid it down pretty quickly on the TAS stuff. How does that kind of translate to as well?\nBill George: What do you mean? The cash flow later in the year or what?\nKevin Gainey: For instance, expense. Just looking at the model.\nBill George: Interest expense is way down, because we have less \u2013 a lot lesser debt and lower interest rates, right. LIBOR is down because we have LIBOR-based borrowing. So, I don\u2019t see why \u2013 our interest expense in the second quarter was much lower than expected, and I would think it would continue at the same level of LIBOR cost.\nKevin Gainey: All right. that works. Thank you.\nBill George: All right, Kevin.\nBrian Lane: Okay. thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Sean Eastman of Key Capital Market. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hi, gentlemen. Compliments to the Comfort team this quarter, job well done.\nBrian Lane: Thanks, Sean.\nSean Eastman: My pleasure. So, you guys typically don\u2019t provide earnings guidance and since you have this time, I\u2019m just going to buggy about it a little bit. I mean, just based on what you guys have done in the first half, if 2020 full-year earnings are comparable to 2019 that implies we\u2019re dipping down 20% year-over-year in the second half. And I understand the uncertainty in the backdrop. But I guess, it\u2019d just be helpful if you could frame how that is in the range of possible outcomes just given how strong the first half has been...\nBill George: I\u2019ll start by pointing out that we\u2019ve said at least comparable, so whatever range there is, we think that \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 the low end of it would be similar to last year. And then it\u2019s hard to tell. We feel very good about our ability to make money and flow cash for the rest of the year. We had very strong third and fourth quarter comparables last year. Go ahead. I don\u2019t know, Brian. What would you add?\nBrian Lane: I think that right now it\u2019s still very busy right now. I mean we checked with everybody last week, and we\u2019re still blowing and going in the field for sure. So, we\u2019ll see.\nSean Eastman: Got it, okay. And then I know 2021 discussion is tough, but it\u2019d just be helpful to maybe, dig in on the big swing factors you guys see as you plan for the next year. I mean, just as we ponder this question on whether you guys are able to grow the top-line next year in a sense, what are the swing factors? Is it maybe, some bigger industrial opportunities? The timing on some stuff like that? Is it maybe, getting some traction on this modular cross-sell dynamic? What are your thoughts there?\nBill George: So, the number one thing would be, we have large projects that we expect will book later this year that are for customers, who has shown no sign of slowing down. But those have to book as expected later in the year. That would be the number one. But if you\u2019re talking about revenue, we\u2019re in a backlog. Our backlog \u2013 if you look at that backlog chart in our slides, our backlog is up vastly compared to two or three years ago. We\u2019re booked farther out than we are on an average usually are, even on a \u2013 even if you control for the acquisitions. Our backlog is really very strong compared to anything I\u2019ve seen in 22 years. So, we have to be pretty optimistic about that. That gives us a great opportunity to continue to make a lot of money. Then you\u2019ve got to face your comparable. And I just think there is so much uncertainty that you got to put a big range around what could happen next year. What I don\u2019t \u2013 and a lot of bad things would happen for us if we do not do very well by historical standards. Then the question is do we do very well by the unbelievable standards of right now? And that\u2019s a tough comparable and I\u2019m not saying yes or no. I just \u2013 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s very uncertain.\nSean Eastman: Got it. Well, that\u2019s helpful. And in terms of...\nBill George: That\u2019s why they pay you guys so much, right? Because you know.\nBrian Lane: Because you know.\nBill George: You know.\nBrian Lane: Yes.\nSean Eastman: Just great at pretending like we know maybe, but \u2013 so I guess, as we think about those bookings later in the year, is there a particular end market driver for some of the bigger stuff that just as we start to think about what we need to be tracking here as we move through the year.\nBill George: It\u2019s all the industrials and it\u2019s all the industrials.\nBrian Lane: Yes.\nBill George: It\u2019s all, it\u2019s pharma, it\u2019s data, it\u2019s food, it\u2019s...\nBrian Lane: Some healthcare.\nBill George: Yes. maybe it\u2019s a tire plant or fiber optic or whatever is out there. and then I think healthcare is an interesting swing factor for later next year. I don\u2019t think healthcare is a swing factor for later this year. But I do think healthcare is an interesting story. The one advantage we have with healthcare is it\u2019s been awful for so long that we have very low expectations of it. But I do think at some point \u2013 it\u2019s hard for me to imagine that five years from now, the conclusion we\u2019d come to from COVID is that we need less healthcare and I don\u2019t think that baby boomers are getting younger, but we\u2019ll see. The timing on that is the question. I think it\u2019s a hydraulic process that can\u2019t be resisted.\nSean Eastman: Got it. Now, that\u2019s interesting. And last one for me, guys. Just \u2013 I understand Walker is sort of facing a bit of a more challenged operating environment than the mechanical business. I just want to understand that electrical versus mechanical operating environment and exactly why that\u2019s been a bit of a drag.\nBill George: It\u2019s not \u2013 so, it is somewhat electrical versus mechanical. On the service side, electrical is less urgent. So, it can get \u2013 for something like the pandemic, can slow service down for electrical more and so Walker\u2019s service division had a much greater proportionate hit than our mechanical service divisions overall. But the real difference with Walker is they do big complex gigantic work and we \u2013 and it\u2019s pretty comparable to our other companies that do that, right? It\u2019s not like \u2013 it is hard right now to have 200 people out building something with masks on and staggered work shifts and there\u2019s COVID\u2019s found and sections get cleaned out for eight days and guys have to go home for 14 days. And these guys are in a war. But it\u2019s not just \u2013 it\u2019s anybody, who is doing their kind of work is in that war and frankly, they\u2019re doing an amazing job, not just them, all of our companies that are doing that, it is unbelievable what they are accomplishing. It is really extraordinary. It just shows how \u2013 really, I think what you should take from this quarter is this is a really, really good company. We do things that people really, really need. Our collaboration is getting better and better all the time and the underlying secular trends really, favors the U.S. in reshoring and complex construction, we think.\nBrian Lane: I like our chances, Sean.\nSean Eastman: Great, guys. Well congrats, again on a job well done this quarter. Thanks for the time.\nBrian Lane: All right, buddy. Take care of yourself.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Claudia Biedenharn from Regions Bank. Please go ahead.\nClaudia Biedenharn: Hi, guys, good...\nBrian Lane: Hi.\nClaudia Biedenharn: Okay, thanks for all of that information. And we\u2019re just curious if you could provide maybe, a little bit of color on what you\u2019re seeing as far as repair and replacement trends in the second quarter and then what you\u2019re looking \u2013 what you\u2019re expecting for the balance of the year.\nBrian Lane: I\u2019ll go first, I mean, the repair and replacement business, as you know, really picked up, particularly in school systems. We\u2019ve done a lot of that work coming right out of March when they let the kids out of school. So, we\u2019re having a really good summer. We\u2019re still seeing a lot of opportunities regardless of the air quality. Air quality has given us a lot more opportunities. But I think we\u2019ll be strong on the service project retrofit business right through the end of the year.\nClaudia Biedenharn: Okay, that\u2019s great. And then as far as what you\u2019re expecting to see from a cash flow perspective in the second half of the year, are you expecting generally to kind of continue the momentum that you were seeing in the first half? Or are you \u2013 and are you thinking like there might be a little bit more pressure on your cash flow in the back half?\nBill George: So, I like our chances of having substantial positive free cash flow. But over time, we will cash flow our after-tax earnings we ever don\u2019t; actually, you should sell our stock and anybody else who doesn\u2019t. So when we have a quarter where we cash flow substantially more than our after-tax earnings that quarter, that means there will be other quarters, where we don\u2019t print money. So, there is \u2013 it will probably be a little bit of give back. We\u2019re also temporarily in a period where the federal government is giving us a little bit of a benefit. I went over that. But on the scale of Comfort Systems, it\u2019s a factor, it\u2019s not a driver. So, but I think we really \u2013 we still have good cash flow prospects for the rest of the year. But I don\u2019t think there is another blow-out quarter, because that\u2019s what \u2013 the quarter to end all quarters when it comes to cash flow.\nClaudia Biedenharn: Right. Agreed, I mean so many of these companies are scaling back on their costs and expenses, and having strong quarters and so just kind of curious if you\u2019re expecting to see some of that come back at the back.\nBill George: Honestly, I\u2019m going to say, as I think about it, I think rising revenues and mild free cash flow is the best scenario for us, because that means people are getting back, we\u2019re getting guys back out. I\u2019d like to see our headcount go up by hundreds each of the next two quarters. If that happens, that \u2013 there\u2019s a little investment in working capital. So ironically, a little good, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be rooting for a giant free cash flow for the rest of the year. I\u2019d rather prefer work to do and money \u2013 needing to spend a little money to get out and start doing it. But we\u2019re going to be fine. We are going to be fine. Cash flow has never \u2013 in 22 years, we\u2019ve never had negative cash flow. So, it\u2019s just...\nClaudia Biedenharn: Of course, Yes. And I just was more looking at cadence. I certainly recognize that you guys are very strong cash flow generators. So \u2013 and thanks for the color. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nBrian Lane: Thanks.\nBill George: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Mondillo of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nJoe Mondillo: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking a follow-up question. First, I was just wondering on the tax rate. It\u2019s been a little higher than past years. What is your viewpoint on the tax rate going forward?\nBill George: So, it would \u2013 the announced range was very big this year, 25% to 30%. We were 27.6% in the first quarter and 27.6% in the second quarter. Last couple of years \u2013 last year, this quarter, we were 23.9%. We picked up some benefit from some, what\u2019s called 179D. We did some energy retrofits, where we got credits transferred to us under federal laws and we just haven\u2019t had that so far this year. I don\u2019t expect much of that later this year. People are really not in the mindset to be \u2013 interestingly enough, energy efficiency and air quality are across purposes, right? Really, the way that you get energy efficiency is you use the same air over and over and the way that you get air quality is you go there outside, you bring in fresh air and improve it. So, I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to see a lot of \u2013 I\u2019d say the 27.5%-ish, 28%, I think we\u2019re stuck at this rate for the rest of the year unless we achieve some other tax planning goal or something, but some of that\u2019s pretty \u2013 we have some of that going on, but it\u2019s pretty long-term.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay. And then on your education market. I was just curious on what \u2013 how you\u2019re thinking about that market, given the fact that may be a good percentage of schools, at least in the very beginning of the school year, will not be back in the school. Is that a negative? Is that maybe, actually a positive as they work on the systems in the schools or how do you \u2013 how are you thinking about the overall education market that you plan?\nBrian Lane: So far, it\u2019s been a positive for us, both at the K-12 level with the kids getting out early, Joe. We\u2019ve been in there and some school systems are doing extra work since they do not have people on the building. Universities, we\u2019re still very busy. So, our backlog on the education fronts are second highest. So, it\u2019s good for the foreseeable future.\nJoe Mondillo: So, I imagine a lot of the stuff that you had in backlog was \u2013 they were able to take opportunity with the kids out of the school to sort of pull that forward and really, get a lot of the work done. But how does \u2013 when you look at new work or bookings in that space \u2013 I know some of these universities are \u2013 have to think about tuitions and the K-12 obviously, is affected by state and municipal budgets. So, when you look at bookings and the outlook going forward. how do you think about that?\nBrian Lane: Our bookings for education so far are very strong, Joe. They still are going to take care of the systems that they have in any schools whether the kids are in them or not.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay. All right. I think that\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking the follow-up questions. Appreciate it. Good luck.\nBrian Lane: All right, Joe. Take care.\nBill George: Thanks.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right, in closing, I want to thank again, our amazing resilient and committed employees. We are very fortunate. The results our team accomplished this quarter were truly amazing. We are looking forward, hopefully, to seeing everyone again in person sometime in the near future. But in the meantime, everyone please be safe and well. Thanks and enjoy the rest of your summer.\nBill George: Yes. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes your conference call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining and have a very good day.",

            "content": "All right, thanks, Julie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. More than ever, I want to start this call by sincerely thanking all of our Comfort Systems USA employees for their work and commitment and especially their courage and resilience during this global pandemic. As all of you know, these are challenging times. But our employees are rising to the occasion. And I feel gratitude and admiration for them every day. We continue to focus on keeping our employees and our communities safe. We employ CDC and OSHA guidelines to ensure our workforce and our community is kept safe and healthy during COVID-19. And we are taking many other actions. In local markets, we have implemented the measures we feel are best suited to local circumstances, such as segmented work zones, staggered start time, temperature and symptom screening, disinfecting equipments and work areas, distancing and the wearing of protective face and nose personal protective equipment. We operate in numerous markets in dozens of states and our leadership in each location is conforming to the measures that are required locally and seeking the path that will work best to keep our people safe and well. That is a true strength of Comfort Systems. In the midst of these challenges, Comfort Systems USA achieved great earnings and extraordinary cash flow this quarter. We earned a $1.08 per share this quarter compared to $0.65 per share in the same quarter of last year. The $1.08 of earnings per share this quarter is the highest quarterly EPS in the history of our company. Revenues were $743 million compared to $650 million in the prior year. And despite revenue headwinds in service, we grew 2% on a same-store basis. Our cash flow was truly unprecedented as we had over $135 million of free cash flow this quarter. And through six months, we are more than $130 million ahead of the same period in 2019. COVID-19 began impacting our business in the second half of March. Our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impact, largely because of building closures and decisions by customers to limit building access. As of the end of the second quarter, the majority of our service operations have returned to normal activity and functioning. Meanwhile, our construction activities, overall, continued unabated, although individual jobs have experienced temporary closures and curtailments from time to time as a result of positive tests for COVID-19 of workers at various sites. Despite these productivity challenges, our local leadership, project management, and especially our field workers have extraordinarily \u2013 have been extraordinarily effective, exceeding our highest expectations. Our backlog as of June 30, 2020 was $1.53 billion. We maintained a very strong backlog despite a sequential same-store decrease of $133 million or 8% since March 31, 2020. This decrease is primarily composed of seasonal variation plus approximately $60 million of projects that we removed from backlog as a result of adverse effects relating to the pandemic. The majority of the projects we removed from backlog will likely be completed. However, we chose to remove any project that has been paused or is expected to be paused, if there is no specified resumption date. TAS Energy, which we acquired on April 1, is off to a great start. With TAS now a part of Comfort Systems USA and when considered in connection with our existing capabilities at EAS in North Carolina, we now have unmatched capabilities to complete complex modular and off-site construction of MEP assemblies in the growing modular construction industry. Our modular construction offering is particularly strong in the technology, medical and pharmaceutical industries. This combination allows us to cross-sell our capabilities to our existing customer base at all of our locations and augments our already strong industrial segment, which has increased to 40% of total revenues so far this year. I will discuss our business outlook in more detail in a few minutes, but first, let me turn this call over to Bill to review the details of our financial performance. Bill? All right, thanks, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for full year 2020. Our backlog level is strong and at the end of the second quarter of 2020 was $1.53 billion. During the second quarter of 2020, we removed approximately $60 million of incomplete projects from backlog as a result of adverse effects relating to the pandemic. The majority of the projects we removed will likely be completed. However, we chose to remove any project that has been paused or is expected to be paused if there is no specified resumption date. Same-store backlog compared to one year ago has decreased by $56 million, but that is more than accounted for by the planned and expected decrease at Walker. Without Walker, our year-over-year backlog is actually up by approximately $15 million on a same-store basis. Sequentially, our same-store backlog decreased by $133 million. This decrease is primarily composed of seasonal variations, the removal of certain projects related to COVID, and the decline in our electrical segment. Most sectors have remained strong with particular strength in industrial. Our industrial revenue has grown to 40% of total revenue in the first half of 2020. Institutional markets, which include education, healthcare and government, were 36% of our revenue, which is consistent with what we saw in 2019. The commercial sector was 24% of our revenue. With the acquisition of TAS and Starr Electric, we expect to continue to grow our off-site construction business, particularly in the technology, medical and pharmaceutical industries. For 2020, construction is 80% of our total revenue with 50% from construction projects for new buildings and 30% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service is 20% of our revenue year-to-date with service projects providing 8% of revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 12% of revenue. Beginning in late March, our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impact associated with COVID-19, largely as a result of building closures or decisions by customers to limit building access. This led to a decline in service revenues of 12% in the second quarter of 2020, all related to service calls, maintenance and monitoring. Our project revenues in service this quarter were flat year-over-year. Overall service profit as measured in dollars was roughly the same because we had higher margins in the work that was performed. Although our construction activities have been classified as essential services in most markets, we have had certain jobs temporarily closed due to government actions, decision by owners, or upon positive tests for COVID-19 of workers at various sites. We have also had some delays in the award of new work and we have been informed of instances of delayed starts. These factors create more uncertainty than usual. And we believe that we could experience potential air pockets in future periods. In addition, we have implemented safety precautions and other COVID-19-related guidelines that have added costs or inefficiency as we work to create a safer environment for our team members and our communities. Even with those challenges, our mechanical construction projects performed incredibly well during the quarter. Finally, our outlook. It is not currently possible to quantify the potential impact to our second half of the year or in 2021 because we do not know how the pandemic and related government decisions will unfold, nor how the pandemic may impact the decisions of our customers. Assuming that the pandemic does not materially worsen the economic outlook of our markets, we currently believe that we can achieve full-year 2020 results that are at least comparable to our record results in 2019. We feel that we are well prepared to confront the challenges associated with this pandemic and we believe that our investments in service and our growth in the industrial segments of technology, medical and pharmaceutical give us a good opportunity to cope with these challenges successfully. We are pleased with our prospects. But given uncertainties related to the ongoing pandemic, we continue to prepare for a wide range of economic circumstances over the coming quarters. We have a great workforce and we feel confident that we will continue to make the most of the opportunities in our marketplaces. Thank you once again to our employees for your hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Steve for questions. Thank you. Good morning, Joe. And Joe, a lot behind that is general contractors were busy as we were in the second quarter. So, they started opening up opportunities as we go into the back half of the third and the fourth quarters, when you see most of that activity. Yes, well, it's a pretty wide range, Joe, as you can imagine. On the construction front, right, we're pretty optimistic as I probably said four times in my script about pharmaceutical opportunity that we think is going to be coming. We've already had a few that we're working on for a number of customers, and I think that will continue, hopefully, as they get closer to a vaccine and some other therapeutics. But let's hope and pray for that. On the service front, you get a lot of conversation about air quality. So, we are seeing a lot of opportunities in a lot of buildings of all sorts about how to improve the air in the building from a whole host of options that are out there. So, we're working with our customers closely about what is the best solution for them. So, I think this is going to keep picking up pace, particularly on the construction front, if they get closer to some kind of medical solution to this pandemic. But, Joe, overall the service that we provide are crucial to anybody that's working at home or in a building. And Joe, we've done a number of these projects already. You saw our service, as I said in my script, the call-out work was down, but our service project work was the same and some of it's related to this. So we're bidding a lot. There's a lot of opportunities out there. We're also doing so. No, I think, he's right, Joe. We're \u2013 as you know, we move very quickly on cost when we need to. Yes. All right, Joe. Take care. Good morning, Brent. A lot of it we've already started. Yes. Yes, Brent. Walker is a really good company. Our guys are just very good and the new companies we've added are still \u2013 really are as good or better than we are on average at that so. Hey, Kevin. how are you doing? just in general, the gross margin you're talking about, Kevin? I mean, I got to tell you, we'd be thrilled to death if we can match that in the third quarter. That \u2013 the results at 19.6%, we're executing at an extremely high level in the field. Yes. We'll be close to... But that is a really strong number, though. It's just too early to tell, Kevin, to give you anything meaningful. Yes. Okay. thanks. Thanks, Sean. I think that right now it's still very busy right now. I mean we checked with everybody last week, and we're still blowing and going in the field for sure. So, we'll see. Because you know. Yes. Yes. Some healthcare. I like our chances, Sean. All right, buddy. Take care of yourself. Hi. I'll go first, I mean, the repair and replacement business, as you know, really picked up, particularly in school systems. We've done a lot of that work coming right out of March when they let the kids out of school. So, we're having a really good summer. We're still seeing a lot of opportunities regardless of the air quality. Air quality has given us a lot more opportunities. But I think we'll be strong on the service project retrofit business right through the end of the year. Thanks. So far, it's been a positive for us, both at the K-12 level with the kids getting out early, Joe. We've been in there and some school systems are doing extra work since they do not have people on the building. Universities, we're still very busy. So, our backlog on the education fronts are second highest. So, it's good for the foreseeable future. Our bookings for education so far are very strong, Joe. They still are going to take care of the systems that they have in any schools whether the kids are in them or not. All right, Joe. Take care. All right, in closing, I want to thank again, our amazing resilient and committed employees. We are very fortunate. The results our team accomplished this quarter were truly amazing. We are looking forward, hopefully, to seeing everyone again in person sometime in the near future. But in the meantime, everyone please be safe and well. Thanks and enjoy the rest of your summer."

            "name": "Bill George",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. And what a performance it was. Our results were remarkable this quarter in every aspect. Revenue in the second quarter was $743 million, an increase of $93 million or 14% compared to the same quarter last year. The increase is primarily due to the recent acquisition of TAS and Starr, both of which contribute to our expanding modular construction offerings. Same-store revenues were up 2% for the quarter and 4% for the first six months of 2020. The fact that we achieved an overall increase in same-store revenue is notable because our service revenue declined by $18 million year-over-year in the second quarter due to the effects of COVID-related closures especially in April and May. Gross profit was $146 million for the second quarter of 2020, an increase of $26 million or 21% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 19.6% in the second quarter of 2020, compared to 18.5% for the second quarter of 2019. The strong margins on our mechanical construction work this quarter more than offset the lower margins that we experienced in our electrical segment. Our electrical segment, in addition to their large project mix and lower service component, continues to experience more than their share of specific project challenges, including the impact of COVID-19 on productivity and certain purchase adjustments that impact our gross margins. With larger projects and less service, our electrical segment also lowers our SG&A percentage. SG&A expense was $85 million for the second quarter of 2020, which roughly matches the prior year, despite the fact that we've added two new operations in the interim. On a same-store basis, SG&A declined by $4.7 million. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 11.4% in the current quarter compared to 13% in the second quarter of 2019. And we continue to benefit from SG&A leverage, largely due to the electrical segment, which requires lower levels of SG&A, as well as a reduction in certain expenses such as travel, resulting from actions we have taken in light of COVID-19. You may have also noted that we also experienced an $8 million sequential decline in SG&A, which is not a usual pattern for us from the first to the second quarter. This decline was caused by a combination of the cost control measures I just described and also resulted from the fact that the March quarter included $4.6 million of bad debt expense in SG&A of debt related to COVID. We did not take any additional accruals this quarter. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 27.6%, which is right in the middle of our expected range and which compares to 23.9% in the year ago period, when our rate benefited from discrete items. Net income for the second quarter of 2020 was a record $39 million or $1.08 per share as compared to $24 million or $0.65 per share in 2019. This 66% increase in earnings per share is particularly impressive as it was achieved despite COVID-19-related challenges. Our trailing 12-month earnings per share is $3.46, a new record for a 12-month period. For our second quarter, EBITDA was $79 million, an increase of more than 50% as compared to the $50 million of EBITDA that we reported in the second quarter last year. Our trailing 12-month EBITDA is $241 million, a record for Comfort Systems USA by a substantial margin. Cash flow for the quarter was really extraordinary. Our free cash flow was $136 million compared to $19 million in the second quarter of 2019. Our cash flow includes $19 million of benefit that is a direct result of the federal stimulus bill, which allowed us to defer certain payroll and income tax payments in the second quarter. Approximately $8 million of this benefit has already been repaid in July. Our best estimate is that these discrete tax provisions will benefit our third quarter cash flow by a net $2 million to $3 million and will benefit fourth quarter cash flow by $10 million to $11 million. The $30 million to $35 million of cash flow benefit that we expect overall from these tax provisions will be repaid to the federal government in the fourth quarters of 2021 and 2022. We also had some benefit this quarter from a temporary disinvestment in working capital as our workforce dipped in April and May. However, we believe that much of that benefit has been reabsorbed by the end of June. Even considering these two items, this was a fantastic level of free cash flow in a single quarter. In fact, the extraordinary cash flow this quarter resulted in two remarkable balance sheet accomplishments. First, we were able to reduce our leverage to less than one turn of trailing 12-month EBITDA much earlier than we had anticipated. Second, during the second quarter of 2020, we funded our second largest acquisition ever. However, we were able to fund that acquisition entirely from free cash flow during the quarter, and we still managed to reduce our debt level. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow is $251 million and that represents the highest 12-month free cash flow that we have ever achieved. During the first six months of 2020, we have purchased 290,000 of our shares at an average price of $37.91. And since we began our repurchase program, we have bought back nearly 9 million shares at an average price of $18.36. That's all I got, Brian. Well, so there were very few bookings in April and May, although they rarely are, right, in the rising spring quarter, right when the heavy work is getting started. Last year was an exception. We had a remarkable second quarter bookings season. By June, we got \u2013 we actually had more bookings than usual at June, although that was just the May catch-up. And in July, we continue to book a lot of medium-sized work. There is \u2013 the big work, we haven't had any big bookings, but we really wouldn't expect those until late this year, though. Yes, with one caveat. Like a month is such a \u2013 our new bookings are so lumpy and a month is such a short timeframe. That is a little \u2013 it's a little hard to even talk about trends in months, but I would say it's actually \u2013 that is pretty much actually true. Yes, we had opportunity. We had an opportunity this quarter where we had to mobilize three companies simultaneously to meet a COVID-related timeframe. We made good money on that, but not material to the results in the quarter. I am most excited about the secular sort of underlying aspects of this. I think that there will be a lot more investment in some of the sectors that we are best at. I think that this has to reinforce reassuring trends over the \u2013 in the coming years. And I also think that in the service side, we have had some sales of things people wanted to do quickly to address workplace safety. But when I talk to people in our controls and service companies, especially some of the more sophisticated offerings we have, they're most excited about the meetings they've been able to get with people that they couldn't get to in the past, and with the idea that people are going to include these considerations as a much more prominent consideration at some levels in the coming years. Anecdotally, I was talking to one of our best guys and he said, when they went in and gave their first presentation, they were selling a lot of analysis. You go sell and they will come back and do the type of analysis that measure the CO2 in the morning and then measure it in the evening and the CO2 change is a good predictor of how much air exchange there is and how much people are breathing each other's air. The control companies have a lot of really interesting products. But one of the things he said that was interesting was they put a slide and they realized they needed to put a slide at the front of their deck that said, things you can do today, because he said that they would meet with people and they'd say, \"oh, that's great, sure, we'll hire you to do a study, but I would like to write to your PL for something today.\" Now having said that, Comfort Systems is a big company, I don't think that really materially changes our earnings outlook. Is there nice positive factors? There are lots of very good positive factors for us right now. But I think \u2013 I really do think the more important thing this does is that it puts these considerations front and center, I believe, really on a go-forward basis and that \u2013 and since we are the best, we believe we're the best there is in this stuff and really, only a few companies around can match us for what we can deploy. We \u2013 that has to help us. I think that's really hard to know right now, but there were math \u2013 there were very important savings from COVID, right, travel stopped. We took \u2013 we had some people for a month or two take voluntary pay cuts. We had cuts that were made in the face of severe concern about just how complete the stoppages that the government was forcing would be. And so I think it's very hard to say, but I would say our SG&A in the next 18 months or 24 months will be lower than it would have been. But I don't \u2013 I couldn't throw out... In my own model, I have the best odd question for me. I think so. I think that it's bound to be \u2013 I mean people... There are things you're investing in and you just have to \u2013 you have to focus for a little bit. There is people going through a lot and that's what you have to focus on. Thank you. Hey, Brent. More than half was hotels, slightly over half. It's just exactly what you think, it's the commercial stuff. If I could \u2013 I don't think there's any exceptions. There was one cancellation and a bunch of stuff stopped... They were positive that we've already started. The ones we took out of backlog are ones that haven't yet set a date for restart. Yes. my best estimate is that they'll start to roll back. I mean, keep in mind, just on a net profit, net cash flow, they are meeting what we expected to meet, but I do think there is upside in the second half for electrical segment margin. So, we took a hard look \u2013 we went out \u2013 we went to \u2013 obviously, when we thought with cash flow, right, which developed over the course of the quarter, we really thought, okay, we need to dig into and figure out what that is. We think that the biggest parts of it other than the specifics I just gave you, which maybe account for a third of it, those individual issues, a third of the improvement, I guess, will be a better way of putting it. I would say that a lot \u2013 we think it's more a catch-up than a pull from the future and obviously, if you get this much cash flow in a quarter, you're doing both right, this much \u2013 this is an \u2013 this would have been a great year for us, really any year. There's never been a year that this quarter wasn't been a great year for us and that much less to have that in the second quarter. But in general, I don't think we're in any particular \u2013 I think the trends there are about what I expect to see continue. Yes. So, they had a big \u2013 they had a big revenue quarter, which you can tease out like you did. Not \u2013 just by 10%, right above, and their revenues like any of our companies are lumpy. They had a couple of really active programs and deliveries in the quarter. They were able to cover really just a massive amount of amortization, because their backlog is a purchased order-based backlog, it turns much more quickly. So, their amortization on backlog was extraordinarily front-loaded like I think more than half of it, in the first quarter, burned. They still managed to make enough money to fully cover everything, every one of those and they were neutral, which is really the main accomplishment, when you look at how much of the intangible they ate out. As far as the rest of the year goes, they will not revenue nearly as heavily in the third or fourth quarter. They right now have really good prospects for a big revenue year next year. But that's my best estimate. Like service? And service is at all-time high profitability as a percentage. Some of the \u2013 like maintenance and stuff work that we do in service was missing, so that average debt to margins interestingly enough. Some of that will come back, we'll make net dollars on it, but it would \u2013 service would have a hard time I think matching that percentage in the third quarter. But overall, we think we'll have very good margins in the third quarter. 19.6% is our best guess. Yes. I should say. there has never been more uncertainty, right? We have very, very good underlying indications as you've \u2013 obviously, we just put in a record quarter. But they're really \u2013 in my whole time at Comfort, I've never seen the same \u2013 this combination of sort of strong underlying indications, but uncertainty for things that are just not within your control. We think we'll make a lot of money in 2021. We'll not be up against the monster comparable, right. So \u2013 and we \u2013 COVID, right? I mean you want to give me assumptions about vaccines and... Elections and government decisions and \u2013 it's the real world, right? What do you mean? The cash flow later in the year or what? Interest expense is way down, because we have less \u2013 a lot lesser debt and lower interest rates, right. LIBOR is down because we have LIBOR-based borrowing. So, I don't see why \u2013 our interest expense in the second quarter was much lower than expected, and I would think it would continue at the same level of LIBOR cost. All right, Kevin. I'll start by pointing out that we've said at least comparable, so whatever range there is, we think that \u2013 it's \u2013 the low end of it would be similar to last year. And then it's hard to tell. We feel very good about our ability to make money and flow cash for the rest of the year. We had very strong third and fourth quarter comparables last year. Go ahead. I don't know, Brian. What would you add? So, the number one thing would be, we have large projects that we expect will book later this year that are for customers, who has shown no sign of slowing down. But those have to book as expected later in the year. That would be the number one. But if you're talking about revenue, we're in a backlog. Our backlog \u2013 if you look at that backlog chart in our slides, our backlog is up vastly compared to two or three years ago. We're booked farther out than we are on an average usually are, even on a \u2013 even if you control for the acquisitions. Our backlog is really very strong compared to anything I've seen in 22 years. So, we have to be pretty optimistic about that. That gives us a great opportunity to continue to make a lot of money. Then you've got to face your comparable. And I just think there is so much uncertainty that you got to put a big range around what could happen next year. What I don't \u2013 and a lot of bad things would happen for us if we do not do very well by historical standards. Then the question is do we do very well by the unbelievable standards of right now? And that's a tough comparable and I'm not saying yes or no. I just \u2013 I don't know. It's very uncertain. That's why they pay you guys so much, right? Because you know. You know. It's all the industrials and it's all the industrials. It's all, it's pharma, it's data, it's food, it's... Yes. maybe it's a tire plant or fiber optic or whatever is out there. and then I think healthcare is an interesting swing factor for later next year. I don't think healthcare is a swing factor for later this year. But I do think healthcare is an interesting story. The one advantage we have with healthcare is it's been awful for so long that we have very low expectations of it. But I do think at some point \u2013 it's hard for me to imagine that five years from now, the conclusion we'd come to from COVID is that we need less healthcare and I don't think that baby boomers are getting younger, but we'll see. The timing on that is the question. I think it's a hydraulic process that can't be resisted. It's not \u2013 so, it is somewhat electrical versus mechanical. On the service side, electrical is less urgent. So, it can get \u2013 for something like the pandemic, can slow service down for electrical more and so Walker's service division had a much greater proportionate hit than our mechanical service divisions overall. But the real difference with Walker is they do big complex gigantic work and we \u2013 and it's pretty comparable to our other companies that do that, right? It's not like \u2013 it is hard right now to have 200 people out building something with masks on and staggered work shifts and there's COVID's found and sections get cleaned out for eight days and guys have to go home for 14 days. And these guys are in a war. But it's not just \u2013 it's anybody, who is doing their kind of work is in that war and frankly, they're doing an amazing job, not just them, all of our companies that are doing that, it is unbelievable what they are accomplishing. It is really extraordinary. It just shows how \u2013 really, I think what you should take from this quarter is this is a really, really good company. We do things that people really, really need. Our collaboration is getting better and better all the time and the underlying secular trends really, favors the U.S. in reshoring and complex construction, we think. So, I like our chances of having substantial positive free cash flow. But over time, we will cash flow our after-tax earnings we ever don't; actually, you should sell our stock and anybody else who doesn't. So when we have a quarter where we cash flow substantially more than our after-tax earnings that quarter, that means there will be other quarters, where we don't print money. So, there is \u2013 it will probably be a little bit of give back. We're also temporarily in a period where the federal government is giving us a little bit of a benefit. I went over that. But on the scale of Comfort Systems, it's a factor, it's not a driver. So, but I think we really \u2013 we still have good cash flow prospects for the rest of the year. But I don't think there is another blow-out quarter, because that's what \u2013 the quarter to end all quarters when it comes to cash flow. Honestly, I'm going to say, as I think about it, I think rising revenues and mild free cash flow is the best scenario for us, because that means people are getting back, we're getting guys back out. I'd like to see our headcount go up by hundreds each of the next two quarters. If that happens, that \u2013 there's a little investment in working capital. So ironically, a little good, I'm not sure I'd be rooting for a giant free cash flow for the rest of the year. I'd rather prefer work to do and money \u2013 needing to spend a little money to get out and start doing it. But we're going to be fine. We are going to be fine. Cash flow has never \u2013 in 22 years, we've never had negative cash flow. So, it's just... Thanks. So, it would \u2013 the announced range was very big this year, 25% to 30%. We were 27.6% in the first quarter and 27.6% in the second quarter. Last couple of years \u2013 last year, this quarter, we were 23.9%. We picked up some benefit from some, what's called 179D. We did some energy retrofits, where we got credits transferred to us under federal laws and we just haven't had that so far this year. I don't expect much of that later this year. People are really not in the mindset to be \u2013 interestingly enough, energy efficiency and air quality are across purposes, right? Really, the way that you get energy efficiency is you use the same air over and over and the way that you get air quality is you go there outside, you bring in fresh air and improve it. So, I don't know if we're going to see a lot of \u2013 I'd say the 27.5%-ish, 28%, I think we're stuck at this rate for the rest of the year unless we achieve some other tax planning goal or something, but some of that's pretty \u2013 we have some of that going on, but it's pretty long-term. Thanks. Yes. Take care."

Our comments this morning as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. What we will say today is based on the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties, that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a more detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K, and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release, covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks Julie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. Let me start by sincerely thanking all of our Comfort Systems USA employees for their work and commitment and especially their incredible courage and resilience during this global pandemic. As you all know, these are challenging times but Comfort Systems is rising to the occasion and we have been very fortunate so far. COVID-19 began impacting our business at very significant levels in the second half of March. In spite of that we had good earnings and terrific cash flow in the first quarter and our backlog is holding up. We will get into those details in a few minutes but I want to comment a bit more about the immediate challenges we are facing. Most important, we are working to keep our employees and our communities safe. Our locations have been working to implement CDC and OSHA guidelines to ensure our workforce and our community is kept safe and healthy during COVID-19 and in addition to working to meet these guidelines we are taking many other actions. In various markets, we have implemented segmenting and designated work zones, staggered start times, temporal scanning and screening, disinfecting equipment and work areas, distancing and wearing a protective face and nose personal protective equipment. As you know, we operate in scores of different markets in dozens of states and our leadership in each location is conforming to the measures that are required locally and seeking the path that will work best to keep our people safe and well. That is a true strength of Comfort Systems. Our overall business was affected in the closing weeks of the first quarter and of course those effects are continuing. Our service business experienced the most immediate and pronounced negative impacts largely as a result of building closures or decisions made by customers to limit building access. Although our construction activities are considered essential services in most markets, we have also had certain jobs temporarily closed due to government pronouncements due to decisions by owners and when sites reported positive tests for COVID-19. While we have seen some construction jobs delayed so far we have not experienced material cancellation. In addition to actual stoppages, our project and service work has experienced efficiency challenges as a result of the important precautions that we are taking. But our amazing teams across the U.S. are still managing to accomplish great work and are being productive in light of these circumstances. Our local leadership, project management and especially our field workers have been extraordinarily effective exceeding my high expectation for how they would respond at a time like this. In the midst of these challenges, we have started 2020 on a very good note. Revenues were $700 million compared to $538 million in the prior year and our growth included a 6% increase on the same store basis. We are in $0.48 per share in the first quarter and that result is despite a direct impact of $0.09 due to COVID-19. In addition to the directly quantifiable impacts as I described above, we are also impacted by less quantifiable ways by COVID-19 including weakness in service and productivity challenges in project work. As of March 31, 2020 our backlog was strong and is more than $200 million higher than the prior year on a same store basis. We are reporting fantastic first quarter cash flow which is a tribute to our team's focus on cash in a traditionally weak cash flow quarter. Before I turn sometime over to Bill, I also want to mention our acquisitions. During February we added a strong company in North Carolina, Starr Electric to our Electrical segment. In addition to having a great contracting business in customer list they will strengthen our modular construction business in North Carolina. Starr and our local business already have a long history of successful collaboration. On April 1, we completed the acquisition of TAS, which we believe will make us the leading modular and off-site construction expert across the growing modular mechanical contracting industry. With TAS, now a part of Comfort Systems USA and when considered in connection with our existing capabilities at EAS in North Carolina, we believe that we now have unmatched capability to complete complex, modular and off-site construction and the growing modular construction industry. Our off-site construction business is particularly strong in the technology, medical and pharmaceutical industries. This combination gives us a great opportunity to cross-sell our capabilities to our existing customer base at all of our locations and augments our already strong industrial segment, which increased to 39% of total revenue in the first quarter. In the midst of these challenges we continue to invest and we remain optimistic. I will discuss our business and outlook in more detail in a few minutes but first let me turn this call over to Bill to review the details of our financial performance. Bill? \nBill George: Thanks Brian. Good morning everyone. So first quarter revenue increased by 30% to $700 million this quarter compared to the same quarter last year which means as Brian said same store revenue also increased by 6%, the rest due to our acquisition. Quarterly gross profit increased by $10 million to a total of $117 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same quarter last year. The gross profit dollar increase was due to the Walker acquisition. Our first quarter growth margin was 16.7% in 2020 compared to 19.8% in 2019. The decline in gross profit percentage is the continuing result of the addition of our Electrical segment which is weighted to large and complex projects with significant amounts of material and equipment pass through cost and which has a lower percentage of service work combined with the effect of inefficiencies from COVID-19.  Our Electrical segment was added at the start of the second quarter of 2019. So this is the last quarter where that segment will not have been included in the year earlier quarter. Our Electrical segment, in addition to their large project mix and lower service component experienced specific project challenges including the impact of COVID-19 on productivity and certain adjustments that impact our gross margin. With larger projects and less service, our Electrical segment also lowered our SG&A percentage. Net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $18 million or $0.48 per share as compared to $20 million or $0.53 per share in 2019. As Brian previously mentioned, we had approximately $0.09 of direct COVID-19 impact and we were additionally impacted in less quantifiable ways by COVID-19 including weakness in service and productivity challenges in project work. For the first quarter EBITDA was $37 million compared to $38 million for the prior year. The small decline in EBITDA results from the negative effects of COVID-19 offset by EBITDA that was contributed by Walker. Now that I've run through our various profit measures before I move on to other aspects of our financials, I want to take a few minutes to comment on potential ramifications for our company from COVID-19 and talk briefly about the mechanics of how and when that is affecting and will affect us. I'm going to talk about some of the risks we're facing; how they create more potential volatility in our results and judgments and the timing for how they could unfold. The global pandemic brings with it many proximate risks, most of which are fairly obvious. Work sites are subject to closure and reopening. Precautions and adjustment measures create an efficiency that's hard to measure and as you saw this quarter the challenges for our customers can affect the timing of and in some cases their ability to pay for services. Although we have not seen jobs canceled that is a possibility and even the likely deferral of some work can create air pockets and planning challenges. There are also second-order risks that are less proximate. The most obvious being the effect of these challenges on industry activity and business cycle conditions. The volatility of the results we are suddenly experiencing can also affect judgmental areas and we will need to closely monitor the ramifications for accrual relating to risk or medical cost, purchasing rebates and our intangible such as goodwill. As the next few quarters unfold we will see these effects. This quarter we reconsidered certain receivables receivable exposures in light of the effect of COVID-19 on certain of our customers. And as a result we increase our receivables accrual. As a result of our bad debt expense for the first quarter was $4.6 million which is a stark increase from last year when our bad debt was only $200,000. We also reassessed our jobs in light of productivity challenges. We currently believe that the second quarter will see the greatest direct impact especially on revenue as we cope with additional service delays and job stoppages and as we continue to adapt to changes that can affect efficiency during the second half of the year. Although we're optimistic conditions will improve there will still be productivity impacts and we may see some air pockets that arise from delays or the slow return of smaller work. We feel that we're prepared to confront these challenges and we believe in our investments in Service and our growth in the Industrial segment of Technology, Medical and Pharmaceutical give us a good opportunity to cope with these challenges successfully. We believe that we can face these challenges in 2020 and that we will emerge stronger. So with that is background let me now comment on a few more areas from the first quarter. SG&A expense was $93 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $79 million for the first quarter of 2019. SG&A increase primarily due to SG&A from new acquisitions as well as an increase in bad debt expense of $4 million. The increase in bad debt expense was primarily driven by concerns about collectability of certain receivables due to the business interruption caused by the global pandemic, specifically with respect to receivables with retail, restaurant and entertainment companies. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 13.3% in the current quarter compared to 14.7% in the first quarter of 2019. We continue to benefit from SG&A leverage largely due to the Electrical segment which requires lower levels of SG&A. Our 2020 tax rate was 27.6% compared to 25.9% in 2019. Our prior year tax rate benefited from permanent differences related to stock-based compensation. Cash flow for the quarter was remarkably strong as our free cash flow is a positive $15 million compared to negative $7 million in 2019. This is a traditionally weak cash flow quarter. So this positive cash flow is a notable achievement for our operators. We feel good about our cash prospects despite the ongoing challenges. As of today our debt balance is $348 million and includes borrowings under our credit facility of $291 million. We have two principal financial cabinets under our facility. The first one is a total leverage ratio which cannot exceed 3.0. The leverage ratio as of March 31, 2020 was 1.5 and today we have very substantial additional capacity of $244 million. The second financial covenant is the fixed charge coverage ratio which is required to be at least 1.5 and which on March 31 was 10.7. So we have seized that trailing 12-month requirement by more than 700%. Those of you who have been around our company for a long time are well aware that we run our balance sheet in order to be ready for time like this. During April, we were able to take advantage of our strong balance sheet to enter into a swap agreement to fix the variable portion of our interest calculation for a substantial portion of our debt. As a result of the swaps we executed we expected about 75% of our bank debt, which up to now has variable interest rates will bear interest at a roughly 2% fixed rate for the next 30 months, an immediate decrease of about a 0.5% even from the low rates we were getting. During the first quarter, we purchased 237,000 of our shares at an average price of $37.85. Late in the first quarter and specifically as the scale of COVID-19 challenges became apparent, we withdrew our automated share repurchase plan and thus we have stopped purchases for now. We will reevaluate that and conditions develop. That's all I have on financial Brian.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog in various sectors and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. Backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was 1.6 billion, the same sort increase of 252 million or 22% compared to March 31, 2019 primarily due to the strong reputations and performance of our many locations. Sequentially, our backlog was roughly flat with a small sequential increase in our Mechanical segment and a sequential decline in our Electrical segment and overall we remain at the high levels that we reported at year-end. Most sectors have remained strong with particular strengths in industrial. Our Industrial revenue increased to 39% of total revenue in the first quarter. Institutional markets which include government, healthcare and education were 36% of our first quarter revenue, which is consistent with what we saw in 2019. The commercial sector was 25% of our revenue. With the acquisition of TAS and Starr Electric we expect to continue to grow our off-site construction business particularly in the Technology, Medical and Pharmaceutical industries. For the first quarter of 2020, Construction is 79% of our total revenue with 49% from construction projects for new buildings and 30% from construction projects in existing building. For the first quarter of 2020 Service is 21% of our revenue with service projects providing 8% of revenue and pure service including hourly work providing 13% of revenue. Beginning in late March, our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impacts associated with COVID-19, largely as a result of building closures or decisions by customers to limit building access. Although our construction activities have been classified as essential services in most markets, we have had certain jobs temporarily closed due to government action, decisions by owners or upon positive tests with COVID-19 of workers at various sites. We have also had some delays in the award of new work and we have been informed of instances of delayed starts. Up until now we have not experienced material cancellations in our backlog. In addition, we have implemented safety precautions and other COVID-19 related guidelines that have added cost or inefficiency as we work to create a safer environment for our team members and our communities. Geographically, COVID-19 has impacted us more in the Northeast and Upper Midwest especially in states where construction has not always been classified as essential, particularly in New York, Michigan and Washington states. Finally, our outlook. We expect to experience the most significant impacts from COVID-19 during the month of April, May and possibly June. However, that will depend on how national events unfold. We also expect that COVID-19 will affect us for remainder of 2020. Assuming that some relief is evident by June, we currently believe that earnings per share in the second quarter will be considerably positive perhaps achieving levels there about one-half of the same quarter in 2019. We also anticipate improvement from those levels in the second half of 2020. However, we are preparing for a wide range of economic circumstances in 2020 and beyond. We have a great workforce and we feel confident that we can continue to be profitable. Cash flow positive and that our ongoing investments will continue to pay off and will accelerate our growth when strength returns to our industry. Thank you once again to all our employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll turn it back over Sheila for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from line of Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital. Please proceed. \nSean Eastman: Thanks gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. I just like to start on the service business. Clearly, it seems like the most materials near-term disruption but just curious to get your sense on how you'd frame demand recovery once the environment normalizes? I'm just curious on how you'd frame, what demand looks like on the buildings that have been empty or near empty and how the business comes back once people get back to work?\nBrian Lane: That's a really good question. I'm always optimistic about Service. I think this is just a blip personally. I think as you're seeing some of the warmer weather increase, people still need to take care of their buildings. They just can't let them sit dormant. I mean we're seeing good activity in Service in the Southeast still today. Also, I think there's going to be opportunity as we go forward looking at the way air flows through a building, looking at filters. So I think there's going to be opportunities and I think service can come back very-very quickly. So we're pretty optimistic going into the summer that will happen. So Bill you have anything? You're good there? All right.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Great. Really helpful. Make sense. And then maybe just broadly if you can comment on what the bidding environment is like currently? Has bidding paused or stopped for new construction in the interim or you guys still bidding and booking work at this point?\nBrian Lane: That's, so Sean, bidding activity probably surprisingly it's still quite good, maybe a little bit more active in different parts of the country but in general we are seeing a lot of opportunities to look at still, some opportunities like in New York State for example with Abbott both in Maine and facilities in outside of Syracuse that needs some quick build but I looked at a couple of bonds, one this morning one last night, so the activities as far as I'm concerned still pretty good. Bill do you have anything to add to that?\nBill George: Yes. I think, I actually so I made a couple even phone calls this morning just to double check. There's activity there is, there were in the last month there were going to be job interviews that were canceled or delayed well not canceled delayed. So there's going to be some delay, obviously you shut things down, you did there shutdown. I also think that there may be over the next quarter or two a little bit slow return of the quick turn work. Our book of business for projects is made up of projects that are developed for a really long time but as you know our average project size is like, I don't know in the hundreds of thousands and a lot of that quick-turn work. So we'll have to wait and see how fast that gets going again. That's one of the reasons we mentioned that the possibility of air pocket but I have not yet talked to anybody who said they see things that were going to happen that aren't going to happen now. That could come but that hasn't come so far.\nBrian Lane: And Sean, you take like I mentioned in my script about New York, Michigan. New York's I think coming back a little bit. Washington State recently I think the other day has started turning it around to add construction. So I think we'll be all right it just how this is going to play out long term.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Helpful and last one for me you guys mentioned the Pharma, Medical, Technology opportunity said, holding out well a few times in the script. I'm just wondering if there's already signs of strength there or just how you expect these opportunities to play out? \nBill George: Sean on technology, we've had big technology customers contacting us, ask us for reassurance that this won't slow us down. So that's encouraging. On pharma, that stuff takes a little while to get going but it I do think that maybe America will see some charm and the possibility of having more important pharmacological ingredients prepared in the U.S. rather than far away. So I think it's pretty, I feel pretty optimistic. I don't think it magically transforms things within a quarter or two but I think these are, this has some good fundamental characteristics.\nBrian Lane: Sean, we are really-really well-positioned in pharmaceutical and the sectors I know we mentioned that numerous times for a reason. So I am pretty optimistic that that's going to come back and there be a lot of opportunities for us going forward. So I think it's pretty exciting actually\nSean Eastman: Excellent. I really appreciate the time. Thanks guys.\nBrian Lane: All right. Have a good day.\nSean Eastman: Best of luck out there.\nBrian Lane: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Joe Mondillo of Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nJoe Mondillo: Hi guys. Good morning.\nBrian Lane: Morning Joe.\nBill George: How are you?\nJoe Mondillo: Good. Doing well. Hope you are doing well as well. \nBrian Lane: We are doing terrific. Thanks.\nJoe Mondillo: Good to hear. Very good to hear. In terms of your sort of 2Q outlook, would you help us understand how you're thinking about that? You sort of talked about how potentially down 50% but I think there's probably a range. Any other information that you can give us whether it's how April's trending and how you're thinking about that 2Q guidance that you sort of provided?\nBill George: Yes. So we gave that guidance because it's the best thing that we have but there are going to be facts that develop on the ground. As far as April goes, we have jobs closed down as we speak because of COVID tests. We have jobs that closed for two days. We have jobs that closed for a week. Walkers had probably more job closures than anybody else on some of their bigger jobs. We don't know how that's going to develop but that's still, we're talking about out of thousands of jobs. So with that we still have work to do. We think Service will pick back up. Really it's what we said in our press release, this is assuming we start to get noticeable relief in June that we're very vulnerable to changes in government pronouncements. We have certain states where we're shut down because the way that the governor worded the order shut us down. So we are subject to facts and circumstances as they develop but right now assuming things trend at these levels for let's say another month and start to get a little better in June that guidance we gave is what we're thinking.\nBrian Lane: So it's interesting Joe we have an opportunity outside of Syracuse. We get a call last Wednesday we're already on the site today. So there's some opportunities and they're quick and they need someone have worked with they can get the a quick. So we are well-positioned for some of these opportunities particularly if it relates to some COVID-19 remedies.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay and in terms of your comments that you made about sort of COVID-19 impacting even the second half of the year but most likely improvement from the 2Q levels. What are the biggest sort of impacts that you're anticipating to the business out once we even start to reopen by June or July?\nBill George: I will go first. I'm going to go first on that. So there's a couple of things. One so immediately we had to look at our receivables and say okay we got this customer. They're not paying their rent right now. Should we impair their receivable to some extent yes. So as you have those kind of immediate impact. They hit us even by the end of March. Then this quarter you have the actual stoppages, the closed building. Once you get past this quarter, I think your biggest risk are there's productivity and there's air pockets. Productivity so at the end of the first quarter and we'll do this again as we close March, we have to estimate how much it will cost us to complete a job. We have to take into account when we make that estimate all of the facts and circumstances that we know about. Well, at the end of March we now knew that we could only put four people in an elevator on a vertical job where before we put 10. We now knew that a scissor lift could only have one guy standing on the platform rather than two. We knew our guys would be backed up getting their temperature taken. So because of that we wrote down some of our jobs. Well, that new margin that they're at is what they'll play out for the rest of the year. So we have jobs. We lowered their margin one time obviously the jobs that are newer the ones that can have the bigger impact on. The other concern I have and these are just, these are incremental concerns but they matter is air pockets. I really believe that some of this quick-turn work will be slow to come back. We actually think we may have some competitors who are getting these loans and have to have a certain number of people working to be forgiven their loans, may take work cheap here and there especially that last minute quick turn work. We've seen a little bit of evidence that that might happen. We have concerns that, we may be slow getting some of our labor back because some of these, because of concerns employees have about coming back but also because in some cases they're being paid pretty well not to work. So all of those are what we're baking into those considerations. So overall we feel like we've got a good business our guys are fantastic. They know they want to work hard and they know how to make money but this is the real world and those are real things and they're going to matter a little bit somewhat.\nBrian Lane: Joe, while we're talking about this topic and we've talked a lot about the field but we are really fortunate here. We've had a work remotely and I'm talking about the finance administration accounting folks both at corporate and the operating that -- Julie leads the charge and she opens up these comments. I can't thank them enough that they were able to meet all the deadlines and get us ready for this call today. It was a lot of hard work. I think Julie spent a few nights here making sure that we would tie it up. So I really want to thank them for all the hard work and how professional and disciplined they were.\nJoe Mondillo: Just to follow up on that question. Are you, do you, I\u2019m sorry lost my train of thought. My last question and I'll hop back in queue. Just a follow up on the prior question regarding new project work. Looking back to past sort of occurrences in the economy obviously we've never seen something like this with a pandemic but we have seen some shocks in the system 2008, 2001, 2000. When you look back at those time occurrences, would you anticipate in this time around to feel an impact to new project work six weeks into sort of the shock if you will or would bidding and new project work would it take a little bit more time just wondering what should we expect to feel the effect of new project work being affected by this at this point in time or if it's going to take a little longer if it will happen at all?\nBill George: So I will take that question Joe. So this is give or take my 60th quarterly call and I will agree with you that we've never seen anything like this. There are some big differences from those prior events you're talking about. The biggest difference to me is Comfort Systems is a very different company today. Our biggest segment going into the most recent the financial crisis with multi-family today at 3% of our revenue, we have tech and pharma that we didn't have then. We've made a big investment in Service. So those are big differences that make me feel like this will enroll in a better way. As far as when these events hit, I think there's two things going on. There's the effects of the emergency that just happening right now and that will be more in the May, that will be this year. That will be in the nature of some air pockets because of deferrals that lowered productivity and then there is the question of what the impact will be on the business cycle next year. I would say the biggest difference between the thing that makes it the hardest to calculate for me, one really big difference between this and the other two big recessions that I have been at Comfort Systems for was when the 9/11 recession hit in the financial crisis recession hit we were already in an unbalanced situation. We were already seeing big increases in unemployment in the United States. We had high levels of vacancies that had already happened. So we were at the start of a recession and then we had a shock. What's different this time is this shock came when the fundamentals were as good as they've ever been, when people were reassuring, when the tax regime was more welcoming let's say when we had cheap and abundant energy, when good things were going on and I think that could make a big difference but I'm going to be honest with you, it's a really hard call about what kind of recession this triggers. We're trying to prepare for all eventualities.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay. Well, thanks. I will hop back in queue. Thank you.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks Joe.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Please proceed.\nBrent Thielman: Thanks. Good morning.\nBrian Lane: Good morning Brent, how are you doing?\nBrent Thielman: I am doing well. Thank you. Bill or Brian I know you had some work at Walker coming into the quarter that it had some lower margin, I think attached to it sounds like that might have been amplified by some of the COVID-19 impacts. Are you through that now and I guess any estimate kind of how diluted that was on the electrical margin this quarter? And I guess to take that a step further how do we think about, I know there's a lot of variables here in the next couple quarters, how do we think about that target gross profit margin in the business as we move through to 2020?\nBill George: So that is even if you set aside the uncertainty that appeared for all of us that's not a super easy question to answer. Let me tell you first about Walker. So Walker historically before we bought them they've had, they really have never made money in the first quarter. That was not culturally something that they had an expectation of and then this quarter they really were punched in the mouth in a lot of ways. They had, I don't know some of it might have been in April but they had multiple COVID-19 shutdowns. They had bad weather on an important project that was, that had challenges. And so this was a quarter that I believe will not even be remotely indicative for them. They also still have a little bit of a purchase adjustment coming through. So I think that this quarter is not at all indicative of what our electrical segment is going to look like. We just added to our electrical segment as well a nice company in North Carolina. So that also adds a variable there. As far as what our gross margins are going to look like, electrical has less service. Electrical has less overhead and more project work. It has more direct and indirect cost. It is cost \u2013 it\u2019s overall cost of sales. So they will leverage down our gross margins. So we were going to be 20 or 21 I would expect we might be a 100 to 300 basis points lower depending on the volumes in that sector. They also have another factor which is they do a higher proportion of cost plus fee work and cost plus fee work is very attractive in some ways because of the certainty of it but it doesn't give you the opportunity for high gross margins that you could get with fixed price work. So that will average us down. Where that shakes up, I think that Comforts long-term growth margins we're trending up. I think this lower, they will leverage down on some but I think the underlying long term trend it's still good. \nBrian Lane: Yes, and Brent this is Brian. This is still a, this is fundamentally sound company. They do very good work. We've recently started working with them as we usually do on training, etc. etc. Been derailed a little bit by current circumstances. But on a long-term basis this is going to be a very good company for us.\nBill George: Yes, this quarter their biggest job shut down twice. That didn't help for multiple days.\nBrian Lane: It's not just work, it's just event.\nBrent Thielman: Yes, got it. But I mean should we take from that you should be sequential improvement in terms of \u2013\nBrian Lane: Yes absolutely. \nBill George: Yes. Throughout the second quarter, yes in electrical I would expect there, I would expect them to have better margins in the second quarter and us to have better margins in electrical in the second quarter, Comfort as a whole the second quarter is when we're really going to, we only have two weeks of COVID-19 impact in the first quarter.\nBrian Lane: And we got the full load now.\nBill George: We tell you we're going to earn half as much as last year that obviously includes a lower gross margin. So you set aside the second quarter then I think we start to trend upwards and I think without COVID-19 this would have been a fantastic year.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. And then on TAS, when you guys came out originally I think you'd said $170 million to $190 million in its first year. Is that the still the right ballpark to think about here?\nBill George: I think TAS is on track for this year. I would lead by a company, we develop a conviction about what it will contribute to Comfort Systems over for years to come. We bake into that there will be recessions and strong markets over that period of time. I am completely comfortable that TAS is still going to provide for us in the years to come the levels of revenue and earnings that we talked about in our press release. I also think they're going to have, they're working hard and we're very good work for the next couple quarters. If there's a recession of any kind in 2021 there's going to be a recession in 2021. I think they'd still be profitable I think we'll still be profitable by which year we give that return and I don't know.\nBrian Lane: Yes. So Brent, we visited them a little bit ago here. They are still very busy and their prospects are very good if things progress on a normal time. So we really feel good about that company.\nBill George: Look they are going to add to the strength of Comfort Systems because they're going to add EBITDA. And if you listen to what I said about our capital structure the key to all of those the only two covenants are EBITDA.\nBrent Thielman: Okay and last one for me, you guys as you said Bill you stepped up the accrual on the balance sheet, I guess attached maybe some of the receivables. Is that related to concerns in any particular sector or market or maybe even geography?\nBill George: So that is primarily, we took accruals against many of our receivables for retail businesses. We have a national account business. It's based in Indianapolis but goes nationwide, uses our companies and other companies to do work. A fair chunk of that work is for retail organizations. We also have a strong similar site based business that's operated out of Tampa Florida that came with BCA when we bought them. We felt like it was prudent in light of circumstances, in light of honestly Wall Street Journal articles to take their entire list of receivables and scrub it top to bottom, get as much intelligence as we could about the various retail companies and try to do everything we could to make sure that whatever concerns we have we address them day one of this situation. And that's what we tried to do and that accrual reflects us doing that. So the vast majority of it is retail.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Thank you guys. Appreciate the color.\nBrian Lane: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey good morning guys. I also wanted to ask about the bidding. Is that more varied by geography or is it more varied by end market?\nBill George: I would say geography both. I think it's too soon to tell in a way because they are just hasn't been that much change in bid. If you talk about sort of delayed interviews for a job that's really going to be the industrial jobs because there's a big job. You don't interview people [per day $100,000] job you interview people for a $10 million, $20 million, $40 million job. So that particular comment relates to the big industrial work and maybe big hospitals.\nBrian Lane: But if Adam just so in terms of geography it's pretty broad. Even in Michigan you know that thing is shut down like there's no tomorrow. There's still opportunities we're looking at. So we're not doing a lot of work there because it's state closed we're still bidding.\nBill George: The Northeast is definitely more traumatized.\nBrian Lane: Yes. No question about it. Night and day from the southeast for example.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. How material could the COVID remedies be?\nBill George: What does that mean?\nBrian Lane: You mean in terms of opportunity to build production facilities, pharma?\nAdam Thalhimer: Yes.\nBrian Lane: Yes. \nBill George: That could help certain of our companies. For Comfort as a whole, it's not going to turn into the basis of our business. I think more importantly but is there may be additional impetus from this experience for people to consider that having more their supply chain closer than China or something would be good. I think that, I mentioned earlier there are senators saying gee shouldn't we have at least one manufacturer of all of the most important for pharmacological substances and shouldn't we, so hopefully people sort of there's the underlying trend of re-shoring is reinforced by this and if it is the good news for us it would be most likely right in the sectors we're the best at and it would be in the geographies an awful lot of that I think is coming towards like places like the research triangle and the southeast and the mid-Atlantic and Texas maybe. I like our geography for that and then the last thing is we do a lot of tech. I think it'd be a hard, it would be a stretch to say that this experience would make people want less data centers or less streaming.\nBrian Lane: But back to the pharmacy Adam, we got a terrific track record in pharma and that goes a long way in that industry for them to give you more work.\nBill George: They like to hire people who have done the work especially stuff they want to do fast.\nBrian Lane: And we got some opportunities right now we're working on it because they know we can do it we can do it fast.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay and then what's the nature of TAS's backlog and their end market mix?\nBill George: Did you say TAS?\nAdam Thalhimer: TAS, yes.\nBrian Lane: TAS. \nAdam Thalhimer: The one you just bought.\nBill George: Yes. TAS is very, very technology focused, very tech maybe 90 plus percent technology focused over the [indiscernible] and they have some big customers, top 10 tech names, top 5 tech names that they do work repeatedly for. One of the things we hope we can do and are very confident we can do with enough time with TAS is diversify into some of the other industries that we do modular construction and but for now --\nAdam Thalhimer: It sounds like their market mix is perfect for right now.\nBrian Lane: Yes. They don't have energy exposure Adam if that was your question.\nAdam Thalhimer: No, I mean they are no oil price exposure.\nBill George: Yes. So knock on wood.\nBrian Lane: They are just based in Houston but they ship all over the place.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And Bill you gave us the debt balance today. What's the cash balance today?\nBill George: Well, so the cash balance today is like 30 some $30 million probably like actual cash in the bank. If you did a book cash that would include cash in transit you might add 20 million to 30 million. So if I close my books you'd see 50 million-ish but if you just looked in my bank account you'd see a little over 30 million. We just tried to, we're keeping about $10 million more liquid than usual maybe a little more than that even just because --\nAdam Thalhimer: But the total debt of because you're -- you closed TAS on April 1.\nBill George: Yes.\nAdam Thalhimer: So you're at 348 of debt, it's not even that much from Q1?\nBill George: Yes. So we had already borrowed the money for TAS. If you look on our balance sheet on  March 31, we had over a $100 million because we closed on April 1, we had already borrowed the money with March 31. So that's actually we're down our net debt is down since then slightly.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Well, okay. And then, I guess last one for me that, as we think through the Q2, it sounds like the impacts really margins, like in your organic sales still be up in Q2?\nBill George: We feel so bad at that, answering that question. I would be surprised. I would be surprised if sequential same store was up but I was just surprised in the first quarter with sequential same store was up but as the over-under number I think would be minus a few percent over last year on same store.\nBrian Lane: Because, to be honest, we are still busy right now Adam.\nBill George: But there are places where we're stopped, I mean I got a job shut down.\nBrian Lane: But we are not stopped everywhere.\nBill George: I got a job shut down for a week in the mid-Atlantic it's not revenue. It's for one week. It's not revenue.\nBrian Lane: We'll see how we do when they count the chickens, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: This is a good call. Thank you very much both.\nBrian Lane: You have good day buddy.\nBill George: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you and the next question comes the line of Joe Mondillo of Sidoti & Co. please go ahead.\nJoe Mondillo: Hi guys. Just a few follow-up questions if you will.\nBrian Lane: I\u2019m sure.\nJoe Mondillo: Do you have any indirect because I know you really don't have any direct exposure but any indirect exposure to oil and gas? I know your 2016 you did see a downturn in the business but I don't know if that was really related to oil and gas or something else?\nBill George: I don't think anybody has less exposure to oil and gas in the E&C industry than we do. But if some building were doing service on [indiscernible]. Some guy in there trading oil probably.\nBrian Lane: But for the most part Joe it's not going to affect the model.\nBill George: Yes. I know we have got very --\nBrian Lane: Maybe we buy gasoline stuff at the gas station.\nJoe Mondillo: Got you. How about our competition? Could you talk about what you're thinking about maybe your smaller competitors? Is there any risk of them going under and not being a positive to your business at all?\nBill George: There is two possibilities. One they just got loaned a lot of money they don't have to pay back if they can keep their people working for four months which means I'm very worried and thinking maybe we've seen take some cheap work, cheap quick turn work. So that doesn't help for the next few months. I do think there are a lot of businesses. Remember, I do acquisitions and talk to a lot of people who, I think that a lot of these owners are not going to be real happy to dump a lot of capital back into their businesses right now. A lot of them are in their mid 60s and 70s. So I think you'll see some people actually not like desperately just blowing up. I think you'll just see some people choosing to downsize or --\nBrian Lane: We've already seen a few, Joe. Some guys just calling it a day.\nA - Bill George: Just call it a day. [indiscernible] there's a company in Virginia where a guy had a nice business, just called it and said it would be a good time to finish especially the guys who have small project work they can do that very quickly. Sometimes they will just sell us, they'll just have a hire their guys. They'll just come over and say, hey buy my equipment for a hundred grand and hire my guys. We see some of that.\nJoe Mondillo: Right. Got it and you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're preparing for a wide range of economic scenarios especially as we had to get to the end of the year and 2021 who knows where we're going to be. What kind of contingencies do you have and what kind of cost reduction actions can you really make? I know your business is largely people. So what can you do offset the downtime?\nBill George: So there's two parts to answering that question. One is the actual business. Our business is varied as a variable cost business. People show up at somebody else's premises and our business also is in the construction industry really construction workers make a pretty good wage but they realize that there are times when there's less work. So in general we can scale our costs pretty, really very effectively to the amount of work we can get. That changes at the bottom of a bad recession because you reach a point where you have this core of your business people who work for you forever and you just want to find a way to keep them busy. So when you see us in our worst year like a 2011 and we don't make a lot of money a lot of that is we are deciding rather than make a few a little more money this year and destroy the core of our business we're going to keep our guys but in general in the ranges we're in today our cost scale to our revenues pretty quickly. So then the question is overhead uncovered SG&A and the reality is you have to do what you have to do and this a thin margin business. Anybody who doesn't control their overhead doesn't hang around for very long.\nBrian Lane: But we've done a variety of cost-cutting things even here at corporate. Many of us have taken pay cuts Joe. So we're doing everything that we think is prudent for the long-term viability of the company.\nBill George: We do what we have to do in bad times and people know we treat them well in good time. So we could usually do that. \nJoe Mondillo: Okay. Just last question following up on sort of the big near-term risk in terms of productivity on these jobs that you're already on and the margins being hit on at these current jobs. What percentage of your jobs would you say are affected by this? I assume some of your jobs productivity you'll be able to maybe meet some of the margins that were in your original bids?\nBill George: Yes. So here is my answer, my answer to that is, most more than half of our jobs, the vast majority of our jobs can absorb this out of contingency that you will not see their margins go down from but what won't happen is we were going to make that contingency later as the job moved on. We will have some jobs that actually have to write down their margins as well but the reality is if you have to spend money on something and you got a fixed price you might get a little bit of money for like [demobe and remobe] in some cases but you make less money. \nBrian Lane: But having said all that Joe that's important but number one is a safety and health and the well-being. We will do whatever it takes to make sure we protect our people and where they're working.\nBill George: Comfort, in bad times we never try to get the last fitting. We try to build for the future. We want to come out of a tough time as an even more important force having a bigger share of our industry and being the people that customers could count on.\nJoe Mondillo: Okay. Well, I appreciate and good luck through the rest of the year. Thanks a lot.\nBrian Lane: All right Joe. Thanks. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you so much. And I'd like to turn the call back to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thank you. I want to once again sincerely thank our amazing resilient and committed employees. Without COVID-19 we believe 2020 would have been a record year for Comfort Systems. However, with the headwinds we are all facing we still believe we will have a very good year. Last year in the second quarter of 2019 we are in $0.65 per share. Unfortunately at this point we don't feel that is attainable in the second quarter. However, we believe that we will be solidly profitable. We are optimistic that as year progresses we can continue to improve. We're looking forward to seeing many of you again in person hopefully in the near term but in the meanwhile please be safe and healthy. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And everyone that now concludes the call for today. You may now disconnect. Thanks for joining.",

            "name": "Brian Lane",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks Julie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. Let me start by sincerely thanking all of our Comfort Systems USA employees for their work and commitment and especially their incredible courage and resilience during this global pandemic. As you all know, these are challenging times but Comfort Systems is rising to the occasion and we have been very fortunate so far. COVID-19 began impacting our business at very significant levels in the second half of March. In spite of that we had good earnings and terrific cash flow in the first quarter and our backlog is holding up. We will get into those details in a few minutes but I want to comment a bit more about the immediate challenges we are facing. Most important, we are working to keep our employees and our communities safe. Our locations have been working to implement CDC and OSHA guidelines to ensure our workforce and our community is kept safe and healthy during COVID-19 and in addition to working to meet these guidelines we are taking many other actions. In various markets, we have implemented segmenting and designated work zones, staggered start times, temporal scanning and screening, disinfecting equipment and work areas, distancing and wearing a protective face and nose personal protective equipment. As you know, we operate in scores of different markets in dozens of states and our leadership in each location is conforming to the measures that are required locally and seeking the path that will work best to keep our people safe and well. That is a true strength of Comfort Systems. Our overall business was affected in the closing weeks of the first quarter and of course those effects are continuing. Our service business experienced the most immediate and pronounced negative impacts largely as a result of building closures or decisions made by customers to limit building access. Although our construction activities are considered essential services in most markets, we have also had certain jobs temporarily closed due to government pronouncements due to decisions by owners and when sites reported positive tests for COVID-19. While we have seen some construction jobs delayed so far we have not experienced material cancellation. In addition to actual stoppages, our project and service work has experienced efficiency challenges as a result of the important precautions that we are taking. But our amazing teams across the U.S. are still managing to accomplish great work and are being productive in light of these circumstances. Our local leadership, project management and especially our field workers have been extraordinarily effective exceeding my high expectation for how they would respond at a time like this. In the midst of these challenges, we have started 2020 on a very good note. Revenues were $700 million compared to $538 million in the prior year and our growth included a 6% increase on the same store basis. We are in $0.48 per share in the first quarter and that result is despite a direct impact of $0.09 due to COVID-19. In addition to the directly quantifiable impacts as I described above, we are also impacted by less quantifiable ways by COVID-19 including weakness in service and productivity challenges in project work. As of March 31, 2020 our backlog was strong and is more than $200 million higher than the prior year on a same store basis. We are reporting fantastic first quarter cash flow which is a tribute to our team's focus on cash in a traditionally weak cash flow quarter. Before I turn sometime over to Bill, I also want to mention our acquisitions. During February we added a strong company in North Carolina, Starr Electric to our Electrical segment. In addition to having a great contracting business in customer list they will strengthen our modular construction business in North Carolina. Starr and our local business already have a long history of successful collaboration. On April 1, we completed the acquisition of TAS, which we believe will make us the leading modular and off-site construction expert across the growing modular mechanical contracting industry. With TAS, now a part of Comfort Systems USA and when considered in connection with our existing capabilities at EAS in North Carolina, we believe that we now have unmatched capability to complete complex, modular and off-site construction and the growing modular construction industry. Our off-site construction business is particularly strong in the technology, medical and pharmaceutical industries. This combination gives us a great opportunity to cross-sell our capabilities to our existing customer base at all of our locations and augments our already strong industrial segment, which increased to 39% of total revenue in the first quarter. In the midst of these challenges we continue to invest and we remain optimistic. I will discuss our business and outlook in more detail in a few minutes but first let me turn this call over to Bill to review the details of our financial performance. Bill? Okay. Thanks Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog in various sectors and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for the second quarter and beyond. Backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2020 was 1.6 billion, the same sort increase of 252 million or 22% compared to March 31, 2019 primarily due to the strong reputations and performance of our many locations. Sequentially, our backlog was roughly flat with a small sequential increase in our Mechanical segment and a sequential decline in our Electrical segment and overall we remain at the high levels that we reported at year-end. Most sectors have remained strong with particular strengths in industrial. Our Industrial revenue increased to 39% of total revenue in the first quarter. Institutional markets which include government, healthcare and education were 36% of our first quarter revenue, which is consistent with what we saw in 2019. The commercial sector was 25% of our revenue. With the acquisition of TAS and Starr Electric we expect to continue to grow our off-site construction business particularly in the Technology, Medical and Pharmaceutical industries. For the first quarter of 2020, Construction is 79% of our total revenue with 49% from construction projects for new buildings and 30% from construction projects in existing building. For the first quarter of 2020 Service is 21% of our revenue with service projects providing 8% of revenue and pure service including hourly work providing 13% of revenue. Beginning in late March, our service business experienced the first and most pronounced negative impacts associated with COVID-19, largely as a result of building closures or decisions by customers to limit building access. Although our construction activities have been classified as essential services in most markets, we have had certain jobs temporarily closed due to government action, decisions by owners or upon positive tests with COVID-19 of workers at various sites. We have also had some delays in the award of new work and we have been informed of instances of delayed starts. Up until now we have not experienced material cancellations in our backlog. In addition, we have implemented safety precautions and other COVID-19 related guidelines that have added cost or inefficiency as we work to create a safer environment for our team members and our communities. Geographically, COVID-19 has impacted us more in the Northeast and Upper Midwest especially in states where construction has not always been classified as essential, particularly in New York, Michigan and Washington states. Finally, our outlook. We expect to experience the most significant impacts from COVID-19 during the month of April, May and possibly June. However, that will depend on how national events unfold. We also expect that COVID-19 will affect us for remainder of 2020. Assuming that some relief is evident by June, we currently believe that earnings per share in the second quarter will be considerably positive perhaps achieving levels there about one-half of the same quarter in 2019. We also anticipate improvement from those levels in the second half of 2020. However, we are preparing for a wide range of economic circumstances in 2020 and beyond. We have a great workforce and we feel confident that we can continue to be profitable. Cash flow positive and that our ongoing investments will continue to pay off and will accelerate our growth when strength returns to our industry. Thank you once again to all our employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll turn it back over Sheila for questions. Thank you. That's a really good question. I'm always optimistic about Service. I think this is just a blip personally. I think as you're seeing some of the warmer weather increase, people still need to take care of their buildings. They just can't let them sit dormant. I mean we're seeing good activity in Service in the Southeast still today. Also, I think there's going to be opportunity as we go forward looking at the way air flows through a building, looking at filters. So I think there's going to be opportunities and I think service can come back very-very quickly. So we're pretty optimistic going into the summer that will happen. So Bill you have anything? You're good there? All right. That's, so Sean, bidding activity probably surprisingly it's still quite good, maybe a little bit more active in different parts of the country but in general we are seeing a lot of opportunities to look at still, some opportunities like in New York State for example with Abbott both in Maine and facilities in outside of Syracuse that needs some quick build but I looked at a couple of bonds, one this morning one last night, so the activities as far as I'm concerned still pretty good. Bill do you have anything to add to that? And Sean, you take like I mentioned in my script about New York, Michigan. New York's I think coming back a little bit. Washington State recently I think the other day has started turning it around to add construction. So I think we'll be all right it just how this is going to play out long term. Sean, we are really-really well-positioned in pharmaceutical and the sectors I know we mentioned that numerous times for a reason. So I am pretty optimistic that that's going to come back and there be a lot of opportunities for us going forward. So I think it's pretty exciting actually All right. Have a good day. Thank you. Morning Joe. We are doing terrific. Thanks. So it's interesting Joe we have an opportunity outside of Syracuse. We get a call last Wednesday we're already on the site today. So there's some opportunities and they're quick and they need someone have worked with they can get the a quick. So we are well-positioned for some of these opportunities particularly if it relates to some COVID-19 remedies. Joe, while we're talking about this topic and we've talked a lot about the field but we are really fortunate here. We've had a work remotely and I'm talking about the finance administration accounting folks both at corporate and the operating that -- Julie leads the charge and she opens up these comments. I can't thank them enough that they were able to meet all the deadlines and get us ready for this call today. It was a lot of hard work. I think Julie spent a few nights here making sure that we would tie it up. So I really want to thank them for all the hard work and how professional and disciplined they were. All right. Thanks Joe. Good morning Brent, how are you doing? Yes, and Brent this is Brian. This is still a, this is fundamentally sound company. They do very good work. We've recently started working with them as we usually do on training, etc. etc. Been derailed a little bit by current circumstances. But on a long-term basis this is going to be a very good company for us. It's not just work, it's just event. Yes absolutely. And we got the full load now. Yes. So Brent, we visited them a little bit ago here. They are still very busy and their prospects are very good if things progress on a normal time. So we really feel good about that company. Thank you. But if Adam just so in terms of geography it's pretty broad. Even in Michigan you know that thing is shut down like there's no tomorrow. There's still opportunities we're looking at. So we're not doing a lot of work there because it's state closed we're still bidding. Yes. No question about it. Night and day from the southeast for example. You mean in terms of opportunity to build production facilities, pharma? Yes. But back to the pharmacy Adam, we got a terrific track record in pharma and that goes a long way in that industry for them to give you more work. And we got some opportunities right now we're working on it because they know we can do it we can do it fast. TAS. Yes. They don't have energy exposure Adam if that was your question. They are just based in Houston but they ship all over the place. Because, to be honest, we are still busy right now Adam. But we are not stopped everywhere. We'll see how we do when they count the chickens, Adam. You have good day buddy. I'm sure. But for the most part Joe it's not going to affect the model. Maybe we buy gasoline stuff at the gas station. We've already seen a few, Joe. Some guys just calling it a day. But we've done a variety of cost-cutting things even here at corporate. Many of us have taken pay cuts Joe. So we're doing everything that we think is prudent for the long-term viability of the company. But having said all that Joe that's important but number one is a safety and health and the well-being. We will do whatever it takes to make sure we protect our people and where they're working. All right Joe. Thanks. Take care. Okay. Thank you. I want to once again sincerely thank our amazing resilient and committed employees. Without COVID-19 we believe 2020 would have been a record year for Comfort Systems. However, with the headwinds we are all facing we still believe we will have a very good year. Last year in the second quarter of 2019 we are in $0.65 per share. Unfortunately at this point we don't feel that is attainable in the second quarter. However, we believe that we will be solidly profitable. We are optimistic that as year progresses we can continue to improve. We're looking forward to seeing many of you again in person hopefully in the near term but in the meanwhile please be safe and healthy. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Bill George",
            "content": "Thanks Brian. Good morning everyone. So first quarter revenue increased by 30% to $700 million this quarter compared to the same quarter last year which means as Brian said same store revenue also increased by 6%, the rest due to our acquisition. Quarterly gross profit increased by $10 million to a total of $117 million in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the same quarter last year. The gross profit dollar increase was due to the Walker acquisition. Our first quarter growth margin was 16.7% in 2020 compared to 19.8% in 2019. The decline in gross profit percentage is the continuing result of the addition of our Electrical segment which is weighted to large and complex projects with significant amounts of material and equipment pass through cost and which has a lower percentage of service work combined with the effect of inefficiencies from COVID-19.  Our Electrical segment was added at the start of the second quarter of 2019. So this is the last quarter where that segment will not have been included in the year earlier quarter. Our Electrical segment, in addition to their large project mix and lower service component experienced specific project challenges including the impact of COVID-19 on productivity and certain adjustments that impact our gross margin. With larger projects and less service, our Electrical segment also lowered our SG&A percentage. Net income for the first quarter of 2020 was $18 million or $0.48 per share as compared to $20 million or $0.53 per share in 2019. As Brian previously mentioned, we had approximately $0.09 of direct COVID-19 impact and we were additionally impacted in less quantifiable ways by COVID-19 including weakness in service and productivity challenges in project work. For the first quarter EBITDA was $37 million compared to $38 million for the prior year. The small decline in EBITDA results from the negative effects of COVID-19 offset by EBITDA that was contributed by Walker. Now that I've run through our various profit measures before I move on to other aspects of our financials, I want to take a few minutes to comment on potential ramifications for our company from COVID-19 and talk briefly about the mechanics of how and when that is affecting and will affect us. I'm going to talk about some of the risks we're facing; how they create more potential volatility in our results and judgments and the timing for how they could unfold. The global pandemic brings with it many proximate risks, most of which are fairly obvious. Work sites are subject to closure and reopening. Precautions and adjustment measures create an efficiency that's hard to measure and as you saw this quarter the challenges for our customers can affect the timing of and in some cases their ability to pay for services. Although we have not seen jobs canceled that is a possibility and even the likely deferral of some work can create air pockets and planning challenges. There are also second-order risks that are less proximate. The most obvious being the effect of these challenges on industry activity and business cycle conditions. The volatility of the results we are suddenly experiencing can also affect judgmental areas and we will need to closely monitor the ramifications for accrual relating to risk or medical cost, purchasing rebates and our intangible such as goodwill. As the next few quarters unfold we will see these effects. This quarter we reconsidered certain receivables receivable exposures in light of the effect of COVID-19 on certain of our customers. And as a result we increase our receivables accrual. As a result of our bad debt expense for the first quarter was $4.6 million which is a stark increase from last year when our bad debt was only $200,000. We also reassessed our jobs in light of productivity challenges. We currently believe that the second quarter will see the greatest direct impact especially on revenue as we cope with additional service delays and job stoppages and as we continue to adapt to changes that can affect efficiency during the second half of the year. Although we're optimistic conditions will improve there will still be productivity impacts and we may see some air pockets that arise from delays or the slow return of smaller work. We feel that we're prepared to confront these challenges and we believe in our investments in Service and our growth in the Industrial segment of Technology, Medical and Pharmaceutical give us a good opportunity to cope with these challenges successfully. We believe that we can face these challenges in 2020 and that we will emerge stronger. So with that is background let me now comment on a few more areas from the first quarter. SG&A expense was $93 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to $79 million for the first quarter of 2019. SG&A increase primarily due to SG&A from new acquisitions as well as an increase in bad debt expense of $4 million. The increase in bad debt expense was primarily driven by concerns about collectability of certain receivables due to the business interruption caused by the global pandemic, specifically with respect to receivables with retail, restaurant and entertainment companies. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 13.3% in the current quarter compared to 14.7% in the first quarter of 2019. We continue to benefit from SG&A leverage largely due to the Electrical segment which requires lower levels of SG&A. Our 2020 tax rate was 27.6% compared to 25.9% in 2019. Our prior year tax rate benefited from permanent differences related to stock-based compensation. Cash flow for the quarter was remarkably strong as our free cash flow is a positive $15 million compared to negative $7 million in 2019. This is a traditionally weak cash flow quarter. So this positive cash flow is a notable achievement for our operators. We feel good about our cash prospects despite the ongoing challenges. As of today our debt balance is $348 million and includes borrowings under our credit facility of $291 million. We have two principal financial cabinets under our facility. The first one is a total leverage ratio which cannot exceed 3.0. The leverage ratio as of March 31, 2020 was 1.5 and today we have very substantial additional capacity of $244 million. The second financial covenant is the fixed charge coverage ratio which is required to be at least 1.5 and which on March 31 was 10.7. So we have seized that trailing 12-month requirement by more than 700%. Those of you who have been around our company for a long time are well aware that we run our balance sheet in order to be ready for time like this. During April, we were able to take advantage of our strong balance sheet to enter into a swap agreement to fix the variable portion of our interest calculation for a substantial portion of our debt. As a result of the swaps we executed we expected about 75% of our bank debt, which up to now has variable interest rates will bear interest at a roughly 2% fixed rate for the next 30 months, an immediate decrease of about a 0.5% even from the low rates we were getting. During the first quarter, we purchased 237,000 of our shares at an average price of $37.85. Late in the first quarter and specifically as the scale of COVID-19 challenges became apparent, we withdrew our automated share repurchase plan and thus we have stopped purchases for now. We will reevaluate that and conditions develop. That's all I have on financial Brian. Yes. I think, I actually so I made a couple even phone calls this morning just to double check. There's activity there is, there were in the last month there were going to be job interviews that were canceled or delayed well not canceled delayed. So there's going to be some delay, obviously you shut things down, you did there shutdown. I also think that there may be over the next quarter or two a little bit slow return of the quick turn work. Our book of business for projects is made up of projects that are developed for a really long time but as you know our average project size is like, I don't know in the hundreds of thousands and a lot of that quick-turn work. So we'll have to wait and see how fast that gets going again. That's one of the reasons we mentioned that the possibility of air pocket but I have not yet talked to anybody who said they see things that were going to happen that aren't going to happen now. That could come but that hasn't come so far. Sean on technology, we've had big technology customers contacting us, ask us for reassurance that this won't slow us down. So that's encouraging. On pharma, that stuff takes a little while to get going but it I do think that maybe America will see some charm and the possibility of having more important pharmacological ingredients prepared in the U.S. rather than far away. So I think it's pretty, I feel pretty optimistic. I don't think it magically transforms things within a quarter or two but I think these are, this has some good fundamental characteristics. How are you? Yes. So we gave that guidance because it's the best thing that we have but there are going to be facts that develop on the ground. As far as April goes, we have jobs closed down as we speak because of COVID tests. We have jobs that closed for two days. We have jobs that closed for a week. Walkers had probably more job closures than anybody else on some of their bigger jobs. We don't know how that's going to develop but that's still, we're talking about out of thousands of jobs. So with that we still have work to do. We think Service will pick back up. Really it's what we said in our press release, this is assuming we start to get noticeable relief in June that we're very vulnerable to changes in government pronouncements. We have certain states where we're shut down because the way that the governor worded the order shut us down. So we are subject to facts and circumstances as they develop but right now assuming things trend at these levels for let's say another month and start to get a little better in June that guidance we gave is what we're thinking. I will go first. I'm going to go first on that. So there's a couple of things. One so immediately we had to look at our receivables and say okay we got this customer. They're not paying their rent right now. Should we impair their receivable to some extent yes. So as you have those kind of immediate impact. They hit us even by the end of March. Then this quarter you have the actual stoppages, the closed building. Once you get past this quarter, I think your biggest risk are there's productivity and there's air pockets. Productivity so at the end of the first quarter and we'll do this again as we close March, we have to estimate how much it will cost us to complete a job. We have to take into account when we make that estimate all of the facts and circumstances that we know about. Well, at the end of March we now knew that we could only put four people in an elevator on a vertical job where before we put 10. We now knew that a scissor lift could only have one guy standing on the platform rather than two. We knew our guys would be backed up getting their temperature taken. So because of that we wrote down some of our jobs. Well, that new margin that they're at is what they'll play out for the rest of the year. So we have jobs. We lowered their margin one time obviously the jobs that are newer the ones that can have the bigger impact on. The other concern I have and these are just, these are incremental concerns but they matter is air pockets. I really believe that some of this quick-turn work will be slow to come back. We actually think we may have some competitors who are getting these loans and have to have a certain number of people working to be forgiven their loans, may take work cheap here and there especially that last minute quick turn work. We've seen a little bit of evidence that that might happen. We have concerns that, we may be slow getting some of our labor back because some of these, because of concerns employees have about coming back but also because in some cases they're being paid pretty well not to work. So all of those are what we're baking into those considerations. So overall we feel like we've got a good business our guys are fantastic. They know they want to work hard and they know how to make money but this is the real world and those are real things and they're going to matter a little bit somewhat. So I will take that question Joe. So this is give or take my 60th quarterly call and I will agree with you that we've never seen anything like this. There are some big differences from those prior events you're talking about. The biggest difference to me is Comfort Systems is a very different company today. Our biggest segment going into the most recent the financial crisis with multi-family today at 3% of our revenue, we have tech and pharma that we didn't have then. We've made a big investment in Service. So those are big differences that make me feel like this will enroll in a better way. As far as when these events hit, I think there's two things going on. There's the effects of the emergency that just happening right now and that will be more in the May, that will be this year. That will be in the nature of some air pockets because of deferrals that lowered productivity and then there is the question of what the impact will be on the business cycle next year. I would say the biggest difference between the thing that makes it the hardest to calculate for me, one really big difference between this and the other two big recessions that I have been at Comfort Systems for was when the 9/11 recession hit in the financial crisis recession hit we were already in an unbalanced situation. We were already seeing big increases in unemployment in the United States. We had high levels of vacancies that had already happened. So we were at the start of a recession and then we had a shock. What's different this time is this shock came when the fundamentals were as good as they've ever been, when people were reassuring, when the tax regime was more welcoming let's say when we had cheap and abundant energy, when good things were going on and I think that could make a big difference but I'm going to be honest with you, it's a really hard call about what kind of recession this triggers. We're trying to prepare for all eventualities. So that is even if you set aside the uncertainty that appeared for all of us that's not a super easy question to answer. Let me tell you first about Walker. So Walker historically before we bought them they've had, they really have never made money in the first quarter. That was not culturally something that they had an expectation of and then this quarter they really were punched in the mouth in a lot of ways. They had, I don't know some of it might have been in April but they had multiple COVID-19 shutdowns. They had bad weather on an important project that was, that had challenges. And so this was a quarter that I believe will not even be remotely indicative for them. They also still have a little bit of a purchase adjustment coming through. So I think that this quarter is not at all indicative of what our electrical segment is going to look like. We just added to our electrical segment as well a nice company in North Carolina. So that also adds a variable there. As far as what our gross margins are going to look like, electrical has less service. Electrical has less overhead and more project work. It has more direct and indirect cost. It is cost \u2013 it's overall cost of sales. So they will leverage down our gross margins. So we were going to be 20 or 21 I would expect we might be a 100 to 300 basis points lower depending on the volumes in that sector. They also have another factor which is they do a higher proportion of cost plus fee work and cost plus fee work is very attractive in some ways because of the certainty of it but it doesn't give you the opportunity for high gross margins that you could get with fixed price work. So that will average us down. Where that shakes up, I think that Comforts long-term growth margins we're trending up. I think this lower, they will leverage down on some but I think the underlying long term trend it's still good. Yes, this quarter their biggest job shut down twice. That didn't help for multiple days. Yes. Throughout the second quarter, yes in electrical I would expect there, I would expect them to have better margins in the second quarter and us to have better margins in electrical in the second quarter, Comfort as a whole the second quarter is when we're really going to, we only have two weeks of COVID-19 impact in the first quarter. We tell you we're going to earn half as much as last year that obviously includes a lower gross margin. So you set aside the second quarter then I think we start to trend upwards and I think without COVID-19 this would have been a fantastic year. I think TAS is on track for this year. I would lead by a company, we develop a conviction about what it will contribute to Comfort Systems over for years to come. We bake into that there will be recessions and strong markets over that period of time. I am completely comfortable that TAS is still going to provide for us in the years to come the levels of revenue and earnings that we talked about in our press release. I also think they're going to have, they're working hard and we're very good work for the next couple quarters. If there's a recession of any kind in 2021 there's going to be a recession in 2021. I think they'd still be profitable I think we'll still be profitable by which year we give that return and I don't know. Look they are going to add to the strength of Comfort Systems because they're going to add EBITDA. And if you listen to what I said about our capital structure the key to all of those the only two covenants are EBITDA. So that is primarily, we took accruals against many of our receivables for retail businesses. We have a national account business. It's based in Indianapolis but goes nationwide, uses our companies and other companies to do work. A fair chunk of that work is for retail organizations. We also have a strong similar site based business that's operated out of Tampa Florida that came with BCA when we bought them. We felt like it was prudent in light of circumstances, in light of honestly Wall Street Journal articles to take their entire list of receivables and scrub it top to bottom, get as much intelligence as we could about the various retail companies and try to do everything we could to make sure that whatever concerns we have we address them day one of this situation. And that's what we tried to do and that accrual reflects us doing that. So the vast majority of it is retail. I would say geography both. I think it's too soon to tell in a way because they are just hasn't been that much change in bid. If you talk about sort of delayed interviews for a job that's really going to be the industrial jobs because there's a big job. You don't interview people [per day $100,000] job you interview people for a $10 million, $20 million, $40 million job. So that particular comment relates to the big industrial work and maybe big hospitals. The Northeast is definitely more traumatized. What does that mean? That could help certain of our companies. For Comfort as a whole, it's not going to turn into the basis of our business. I think more importantly but is there may be additional impetus from this experience for people to consider that having more their supply chain closer than China or something would be good. I think that, I mentioned earlier there are senators saying gee shouldn't we have at least one manufacturer of all of the most important for pharmacological substances and shouldn't we, so hopefully people sort of there's the underlying trend of re-shoring is reinforced by this and if it is the good news for us it would be most likely right in the sectors we're the best at and it would be in the geographies an awful lot of that I think is coming towards like places like the research triangle and the southeast and the mid-Atlantic and Texas maybe. I like our geography for that and then the last thing is we do a lot of tech. I think it'd be a hard, it would be a stretch to say that this experience would make people want less data centers or less streaming. They like to hire people who have done the work especially stuff they want to do fast. Did you say TAS? Yes. TAS is very, very technology focused, very tech maybe 90 plus percent technology focused over the [indiscernible] and they have some big customers, top 10 tech names, top 5 tech names that they do work repeatedly for. One of the things we hope we can do and are very confident we can do with enough time with TAS is diversify into some of the other industries that we do modular construction and but for now -- Yes. So knock on wood. Well, so the cash balance today is like 30 some $30 million probably like actual cash in the bank. If you did a book cash that would include cash in transit you might add 20 million to 30 million. So if I close my books you'd see 50 million-ish but if you just looked in my bank account you'd see a little over 30 million. We just tried to, we're keeping about $10 million more liquid than usual maybe a little more than that even just because -- Yes. Yes. So we had already borrowed the money for TAS. If you look on our balance sheet on  March 31, we had over a $100 million because we closed on April 1, we had already borrowed the money with March 31. So that's actually we're down our net debt is down since then slightly. We feel so bad at that, answering that question. I would be surprised. I would be surprised if sequential same store was up but I was just surprised in the first quarter with sequential same store was up but as the over-under number I think would be minus a few percent over last year on same store. But there are places where we're stopped, I mean I got a job shut down. I got a job shut down for a week in the mid-Atlantic it's not revenue. It's for one week. It's not revenue. Thanks. I don't think anybody has less exposure to oil and gas in the E&C industry than we do. But if some building were doing service on [indiscernible]. Some guy in there trading oil probably. Yes. I know we have got very -- There is two possibilities. One they just got loaned a lot of money they don't have to pay back if they can keep their people working for four months which means I'm very worried and thinking maybe we've seen take some cheap work, cheap quick turn work. So that doesn't help for the next few months. I do think there are a lot of businesses. Remember, I do acquisitions and talk to a lot of people who, I think that a lot of these owners are not going to be real happy to dump a lot of capital back into their businesses right now. A lot of them are in their mid 60s and 70s. So I think you'll see some people actually not like desperately just blowing up. I think you'll just see some people choosing to downsize or -- So there's two parts to answering that question. One is the actual business. Our business is varied as a variable cost business. People show up at somebody else's premises and our business also is in the construction industry really construction workers make a pretty good wage but they realize that there are times when there's less work. So in general we can scale our costs pretty, really very effectively to the amount of work we can get. That changes at the bottom of a bad recession because you reach a point where you have this core of your business people who work for you forever and you just want to find a way to keep them busy. So when you see us in our worst year like a 2011 and we don't make a lot of money a lot of that is we are deciding rather than make a few a little more money this year and destroy the core of our business we're going to keep our guys but in general in the ranges we're in today our cost scale to our revenues pretty quickly. So then the question is overhead uncovered SG&A and the reality is you have to do what you have to do and this a thin margin business. Anybody who doesn't control their overhead doesn't hang around for very long. We do what we have to do in bad times and people know we treat them well in good time. So we could usually do that. Yes. So here is my answer, my answer to that is, most more than half of our jobs, the vast majority of our jobs can absorb this out of contingency that you will not see their margins go down from but what won't happen is we were going to make that contingency later as the job moved on. We will have some jobs that actually have to write down their margins as well but the reality is if you have to spend money on something and you got a fixed price you might get a little bit of money for like [demobe and remobe] in some cases but you make less money. Comfort, in bad times we never try to get the last fitting. We try to build for the future. We want to come out of a tough time as an even more important force having a bigger share of our industry and being the people that customers could count on."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Carmen. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's Fourth Quarter and full-year 2021 Earnings call. Our comments today [Indiscernible] press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws and regulations. What we will say today is based on the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most Recent Form 10-K as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website, found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are; Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer, Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer, and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. We have more information than usual to cover, but considering the events in Ukraine and Europe, we will try to be as efficient as possible and our thoughts are with those who are affected. We are pleased to report a strong finish to 2021. Our team has delivered excellent execution across our segments and we are grateful for their hard work. For the fourth quarter, we earned $1.4 per share on Revenue of $856 million. same-store Revenue grew by 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as overall non-residential building construction and service continue to show broad-based strength. For the first time ever, we are reporting more than $3 billion in full-year revenues. We have good cash flow and our backlog has registered an unprecedented increase. In addition, in January of 2022, we received approvals of previously filed tax refund claims for the past years. That will meaningfully impact our first quarter results. And Bill will review those in detail during his remarks. We had an active fourth-quarter for acquisitions. At the beginning of December, we acquired IV Mechanical, which services customers across the Southeast and United States. We have known IV for 25 years and their Mechanical Construction and service expertise is well-positioned for collaboration and mutual benefits. On the last day of December, we acquired EDWARDS ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL based in Indiana. Edwards brings us a solid full-service presence in Indianapolis, and provides new capabilities in clean room solutions that will complement our off-site construction and pre -fabrication. On December 31, we also acquired a strong servicing controls business in Kentucky thermal solutions. And on that same day, we acquired Kodiak labor solutions, a temporary staffing agency that we have worked with on an ongoing basis and which will help us recruit and deploy skilled construction labor in many of our markets. We are happy to have these strong teams as a great new part of Comfort Systems USA. And we are confident that we have added some wonderful people and strong capabilities. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes. But first I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill.\nWilliam George: Thanks, Brian. Good morning everyone and good afternoon for those on the East Coast. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $856 million, an increase of $157 million or 22% compared to last year. Same-store revenue increased by a strong 8% with the remaining increase resulting from our acquisitions of TEC and Amteck, and one month of owning IB. Revenue for the full year 2021 was $3.1 billion, an increase of 8% compared to 2020 and the annual increase was a result of our 2020 and '21 acquisitions. As you know, we and our industry are experiencing delays in the receipt of materials and equipment, which modestly reduced our revenue in the fourth quarter. It is impossible to precisely measure that effect because there are always variances and timing issues relating to merit -- materials and equipment. However, we roughly estimate that our revenue would have been higher without these issues and our best estimate is that the effect on the fourth-quarter revenue was a reduction of perhaps 2% to 4%. And we expect to continue to experience these effects for at least the first half of 2022, and we currently expect high single-digit same-store revenue growth for the upcoming year.  Gross profit was $154 million for the Fourth Quarter of 2021 at $17 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage was 18% this quarter compared to 19.6% for the Fourth Quarter of 2020. Our gross profit percentage in our Mechanical segment declined to 18.9%, while margins in the Electrical segment have increased significantly compared to last year from 10.7% in 2020 to 14.5% in 2021. The decrease in the gross profit percentage resulted from several factors, including cost pressure and changes in revenue mix as new construction increased in proportion to our revenues, and the fact that we are in the early stages on a disproportionate amount of our project work. For the full year 2021, gross profit increased by $16 million and our gross profit margin was 18.3% in 2021 that\u2019s compared to 19.1% in 2020. SG&A expense for the quarter was $105 million or 12.3% of revenue compared to $89 million or 12.7% of revenue for the Fourth Quarter of 2020. On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $5 million, primarily due to compensation-related items. For the full year, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 12.2% for 2021, down from 12.5% for 2020.  On a same-store basis for the full-year SG&A declined $7 million primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense. Our operating income in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $49.3 million, slightly higher than the same quarter of the prior year. Last year in our fourth quarter, we got a benefit from earn-out changes. That was 11% higher than we reported this year. Each quarter end, we examine our estimates related to our earn-out liabilities. As a result, this quarter we reported an overall gain of $3 million or $0.07 per share in 2021 as compared to $7 million or $0.18 per share in the prior year. Our 2021 tax rate was in the expected range at 24.7%. After considering all of the factors above, net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $38 million or $1.04 per share. This compares to net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $43 million or $1.17. Our full-year earnings per share was $3.93 per share compared to $4.9 in the prior year. For our fourth quarter EBITDA increased by 8% to $68 million, and our full-year 2021 EBITDA increased just $256 million. Full year 2021 free cash flow was $161 million compared to $265 million in 2020. Our prior year free cash flow was increased by disinvestment in working capital from COVID, and federal legislation that allowed us to defer $32 million in 2020 payroll taxes. 2021 cash was decreased by $18 million as we paid back a portion of the deferral, thus creating a $50 million timing issue just from that tax issue. Despite these factors, 2021 was a great cash flow year for us. And although we will deploy working capital in the early stages of the various projects we're starting. We believe that we have strong cash prospects for 2022. Brian mentioned that we closed four acquisitions in the fourth quarter. IV was acquired on December 1st and is reported in our Mechanical segment.  It is expected to contribute annualized revenues of approximately $150 million to $160 million and EBITDA of $7 million to $9 million. The other three acquisitions closed on December 31st and their results will only be included in our financial results beginning January 1st. However, their balance sheet and backlog are included as of December 31st. We expect Edwards to contribute annualized revenues of approximately $85 million to $95 million, and EBITDA of $6 million to $8 million. Thermal should contribute approximately $20 million in revenue and consistent margins and finally Kodiak, which is a staffing company that was acquired to augment labor resources, is not expected materially contribute to revenue or EBITDA on a standalone basis. Because of the amortization expense related to intangibles and other acquisition costs, these acquisitions are not expected to contribute to EPS in 2022. After incurring approximately $130 million to fund these acquisitions, our debt at the end of the year was $388 million. We're continuing to opportunistically repurchase our shares. In 2021, we purchased 363,000 shares at an average price of $74.57 and we have been active in share repurchases over the last few weeks. Since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back 9.7 million shares at an average price of $21.69. Before I pass the time back to Brian, I want to describe the tax events that he alluded to and that were mentioned in the press release. In January 2022, we received approval from the IRS for our previously filed refund claims for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 years. The refunds were primarily due to claiming the credit for increasing research activities that we refer to as the R&D tax credit. As a result, we expect that the first quarter of 2022 will have an incremental benefit of approximately $30 million in after-tax net income or approximately $0.80 per diluted share. And we expect to receive approximately $30 million of operating cash during the first quarter of 2022. In addition to the immediate gains from these IRS approvals, we will be reassessing the judgments that we have been made regarding our taxes for the intervening years of 2019, 2020, and the recently concluded 2021, since we expect to assert the credit for those years as well, we're assessing the amounts and likelihood of benefit that will result from those credits and will also include that benefit when we report our first quarter. The changes in assessment are ongoing, but we expect that we will reduce our provision for income taxes with respect to these years, and we estimate that we will record additional first-quarter income that we currently approximate at $22 million or $0.60 per diluted share. Finally, our successful assertion of the R&D tax credit will be likely to reduce our effective tax rate in future years, beginning immediately in 2022. The tax benefit will vary based on our qualifying expenses each year, but should lower our tax rate by approximately four to five percentage points in 2022 and in future years until and unless the landscape for these credits which have been made permanent by Congress, change. I'm very appreciative of the hard work done by our tax department and by numerous of our subsidiaries in seeking and documenting these credits. That's all I have on financial trend.\nTrent Mckenna: Thank you, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for 2022 and on inflation and supply chain considerations. Our backlog at the end of 2021 was $2.31 billion. And this is the first time that our backlog has exceeded $2 billion. Sequentially, our same-store backlog increased $224 million with strength in our modular work and in our electrical operations in Texas. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog is up by over $578 million or at 38%, a broadly-based increase. Industrial customers were 44% of our total revenue in 2021. We think this sector, which includes technology, life sciences, and food processing, will remain strong for us as industrial has heavily represented a new backlog, as well as in our recent larger acquisitions. Institutional markets, which include education, health care, and government, are also strong and represented 32% of our revenue. The commercial sector is also doing well. But with our changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 24% of revenue. Year-to-date construction was 78% of our revenue, with 46% from construction projects for new buildings, and 32% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service was strong this year. And our increasing service revenue was 22% of year-to-date revenue, with service projects providing 9% of revenue, and pure service, including hourly work, providing 13% of revenue. 2021 service revenue is up by 12%. And with our continuing strong margins, our service earnings were up by a similar amount. Overall, service continues to be a great source of profit for us.  As 2022 begins, we believe that we are returning to good ongoing market conditions and that we have largely recovered from negative impacts to our business due to business disruption caused by COVID-19. At the same time, we are experiencing inflation and some delays in materials and equipment. As we mentioned, supply chain and inflation were factors in 2021, especially in the fourth quarter. And we currently expect that those effects will continue through at least the first half of 2022. We are recognizing these challenges in our job planning and pricing, and we are working with our customers to share the risks and mitigate the effects of these challenges. In addition, during the first six weeks of 2022, we experienced temporary reductions and available labor as Omicron peaked. And that will also add some headwind to what we nevertheless expect will be a solid and profitable first quarter of 2022. We believe the good trends outweigh the challenges, and we remain optimistic about our prospects for 2022. The headwinds described above will likely be pronounced during the first half of 2022. However, our current belief and expectation is that in 2022 our full-year earnings in margins are likely to be comparable to 2021, with an opportunity for improvement as we get farther into our backlog as the year progresses. As we continue to emerge from the various effects of the pandemic, we believe that future demand in our key markets is strong, and we continue to invest in our workforce, technology, execution capabilities and in our service businesses. Underlying demand for our capabilities, especially in our key segments, including industrial and institutional buildings, continues to be very robust. Our fundamental outlook for the next several quarters is very positive, especially with our strong backlog and pipeline. We are happy with our investments today, and we are keen to continue to invest, grow and improve in our essential industry. Our skilled workforce is the heart and soul of Comfort Systems USA. And we will continue to develop and reward our unmatched team members as they strive each day to work safely, improve our communities, and provide the built infrastructure to serve our many markets. I will now turn it back to comments for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your question please.\nSean Eastman: Hi gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions.\nBrian Lane: Hi, good morning Sean.\nSean Eastman: Good morning. So I wanted to start on the margins. I think you said at the end, Brian, that margins are going to be comparable to 2021. They did look a little soft in the fourth quarter. I think there is some mix elements going on. You mentioned COVID and, and supply chain, so maybe just some color on what's happening under the hood, how margins should progress over the next 12 months. Just the moving pieces in there would be great.\nTrent Mckenna: I'll start and [Indiscernible] is Bill wants to follow up, but what gives us optimism is that the work and the opportunities is good, the margins are good in the work that we're winning. We're still executing in January. And as the year goes on. So I think we'll hit our average and margins will reflect 2022. I think we're managing as best we can the supply chain and inflation with our customers, and we are doing everything to satisfy them and be successful.\nWilliam George: Yeah. So if you compare our margins for 2021 with our peak years, especially the really high margins that we had during COVID, it's not a good comparison because our mix was so much different. We were doing far less new construction, which has a lot more material pass-through. We had not bought a bunch of electrical companies which even though their revenue -- their margins are up, they do average lower margins and lower SG&A than mechanical companies. For the next several months, we're going to be towards the beginning of a lot of jobs that we're just not going to be pulling a bunch of profit out till we see how much it rains, until we see how other people on the job do, and until we see startup some systems and put liquid in some pipes. And so I think that what we're trying to say is we liked our margins last year. Yeah. We could have executed a few places, especially where COVID affected us but we think what you saw last year is what you'll see through the beginning of this year as we get deeper into these jobs, there's certainly an opportunity to do better, but we're not popping back up to the 2021 range. We just have a different mix right now.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That's helpful. And I think you also said at the end, Brian, that earnings will be comparable for last year. I just wanted to clarify that, particularly considering we've got high single-digit top-line outlook and these big tax benefits coming early in the year.\nWilliam George: Yes, so with the range of earnings is what we made last year or more. One of the things that we experienced last year, was people overreacting to the supply chain, some of these issues and getting very pessimistic. So what we were just really trying to say is, look, we're going to make a lot of money again, we're going to flow a lot of cash again. We certainly hope to have improvement this year over last year, but we do have -- early in the year, we do have a little bit of revenue headwind. We had Omicron create absenteeism in January. We do have -- we said we thought our revenue was affected 2% to 4% in the fourth quarter. We'll continue to have chillers show up a little later than we expected and things like that. Less buyout in our jobs, right? Pretty hard right now to call and ask a supplier for a discount. You actually are just probably calling and begging them to make sure you get your stuff. So, that's why we are predicting what we're predicting.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. Just sneaking one more in. Just on the tax benefit stuff, what's the tax -- how is the tax provision going to look in the first quarter? And then as we advance through the rest of the year, what's the normal tax rate now? And for how many years into the future do you expect to have this four to five point reduction in the tax rate?\nWilliam George: Okay, hold on for a minute, Brian, getting out of slide rule.\nBrian Lane: I'll let Julie [Indiscernible] Sean.\nWilliam George: So essentially, we've been saying we're at 25% to 27% tax rate. Now, we're going to be 4% or 5% below that. And that's cushioning that some right, because we're not making the assumption that we'll do as well in the ongoing [Indiscernible] as we were able to do for those five consecutive years that we just settled up. But whatever else it's true. After five-years now of getting this benefit. Frankly, we have to bake in that benefit as we look at our tax rates for the next several years, and we think it's going to lower our tax rate for 5%. And so if you hire future cash flow and saw some changes.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. All right. I'll turn it over there. Thanks so much.\nWilliam George: All right. Take care, Sean.\nOperator: All right. Your next question comes from Brent Thielman with DA Davidson. Your line is open.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, thank you. Hey, Brian or Bill, are there a few particularly large projects in the backlog right now that need to kind of hit certain thresholds for margins to move a lot higher, or is this kind of more of a broader statement across the business in terms of the new construction work you've taken on?\nBrian Lane: Yeah, it's a combination of both. We do have some larger projects that we're very optimistic about. But it's also broad based in terms of the ranges of the sizes. It's that typical mix. Brent, as we go through smaller work, mid-level work, and a few larger projects, and the larger projects with companies -- now that we know they can handle the larger projects. So I think the mix is pretty typical of what we usually have.\nBrent Thielman: And then service growth has been a great story here. Maybe you just talk about some of the initiatives you're undertaking that continue to grow that business in 2022. Can we see another year of double-digit growth? How do you think about that?\nBrian Lane: I'm still very optimistic about service, we continue to make the investments we've made over the last ten years. Our goal is to achieve double-digit growth as we go along. So far, we've done it. We'll continue to invest in training, improve in our sales process, and we're executing really well in service, particularly on the small project front. So I expect that trend to continue, Brent. There is nothing that tells me it will be different.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. And then just the uptick again in backlog, particularly same-store backlog is great story there. How much of that be attributed to sort of this industrial vertical versus these, I guess more traditional non ready market, education office retail, smaller pieces of the pie, are those markets starting to become more impactful to the growth in bookings you think?\nWilliam George: Yeah, really both on an acquired basis and on a same-store basis. If you look at the biggest -- the subsidiaries, we mentioned, I think in the script that we had big increases in modular and in electrical. Both of those, the new projects that were booked are disproportionately industrial complex, TEC, Pharma, some battery for sure is waking up. Haven't -- we've only booked a little bit of battery, but there's a ton of battery in the pipeline for electric cars. So, yeah 100% it's a trend.\nBrian Lane: Yes. So Brent, if you look at the mix and about over 40% of its industrial -- but it's a capability we have, it's not a new capability that we're starting. It's the companies that we brought in here that already had a long history of doing it. So we're very comfortable with the resources we have to address that market.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions and best of luck.\nBrian Lane: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.\nJulio Romero: Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions.\nBrian Lane: Hey, how are you?\nJulio Romero: I'm good. Thanks. So to your point earlier, the electrical segment margins are inherently lower than mechanical and it's going to pull down the consolidated margins. But if I look at the last few quarters, I think your electrical gross margins are trending upward and I want to say the incremental on the electrical segment seem to be trending nicely. So can you maybe speak to what's going right in electrical and what you're doing there to improve the margins?\nBrian Lane: Yeah. So electrical, and thank you for noticing, has improved. I think we -- the companies have worked really hard. We've got back to some of the basics. I think they've benefited some of the training that Comfort provides in our new acquisitions as we were back to focusing on work that we're really good at, data centers, for example, food processing. And I think the one thing about the margins might be a little lower, but they are overheads lower. So you look at the operating level are about the same. But I just think it's just improving on the fundamentals that these companies have done. They doing a great job, a great job as it -- as you can tell from their results.\nJulio Romero: Okay, that's helpful. And can you speak to what [Indiscernible], what equipment you're seeing delays on? I think you mentioned chillers earlier. And do you think it's fair to assume the go-forward impact of those delays to be in the same range you saw in the fourth-quarter?\nWilliam George: So the things -- switchgear and generators can be -- have really long lead time. Chillers have long lead times. Some of the commodity stuff has gotten better lately. It's like some stuff is getting better while other stuff gets a little worse. It's very -- essentially you're -- we\u2019re having to order much earlier, like in our bids. We\u2019re telling people you have to let us by this stuff now and you have to pay us to store it or we can't commit to your schedule. But so far, generally speaking, we get the stuff. It's really hard to predict. Anybody who tells you they know how this is going to enroll over the next year, is fooling themselves. But we think we're really good at managing it. And we think that we -- on any given construction job frequently, not everything's on the critical path. There's always work you can -- generally speaking, there's work you can keep doing. So, I think we just think our guys are really great at managing it but, it's definitely a factor Brian.\nBrian Lane: Yeah, and if you look at -- we have good partners and we try to be a good partner. I think that's really paying off. Also, I think the advantage of our size versus maybe more of a mom-and-pop type contract that we can bite us equipment. Early air and put the orders. And I think that's an advantage because we at the end of the day do not want to disappoint our customers. So we're doing everything we can to make sure we get the equipment yet to install.\nJulio Romero: Alright. And then just last one for me would be can you maybe speak to the IV acquisition and the rationale there and how it complements here. Because I think portfolio and maybe touch on market sector breakout, whether it's weighted to industrial, institutional, et cetera.\nWilliam George: I'll start. So IB is a fantastic company. We -- you may have noticed in the press release, we said we've talked to them for 25 years. The statements I put in that press release was taken from a letter that they're -- the guy who runs it rotated the employees when we bought it. This a company we've known for a long time. They have really good standing workforces and some very attractive markets like Nashville and Kentucky in North Carolina and of course Mississippi, Atlanta. They also have a group of workers that travel and has been very expert for many, many years at healthcare, in particular hospitals. Hospital jobs have gotten bigger and bigger and I think after this long period of knowing each other, I think we and IV look at each other, and realize just how much benefit it could be to get together, because their traveling guys can augment us as we need the new jobs that are bigger than what they used to the travel to do. They can split with our guy, with our existing companies. We think it's just a wonderful fit, right? Think of the markets I just said, and then think of where Comfort is and where we make lots of money, and there are really good -- they're a really good fit from the point of view of our culture. They just fit in with our people. Everybody has interacted with them so far, has just been very, very happy. Is the company. I will set up in the second. It\u2019s a company that's shown discipline over many, many years. At times it's shown discipline we should have shown. So we just think it's a really good fit, a really good opportunity to make each other better and really have some fun.\nTrent Mckenna: Julio, what's really interesting they've only been here two months and we're already working on some joint projects with them. So this has started off really well.\nJulio Romero: Great, sounds exciting. Thanks very much and best of luck in 2022.\nBrian Lane: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBrian Lane: Good morning Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Can we start just on some of the income statement items, obviously, maybe for Bill. Just thoughts on SG&A and D&A and interest expense, because I'm just -- I still trying to square the comparable EPS comments and maybe the secret is somewhere on those lines.\nWilliam George: Well, the secret is we don't know what's going to happen next year. But I think you'll see interest expense tick up some. Will tick up some because our debts a little higher, it will tick up a little more probably because as we -- we were paying 1.3% on our borrowing. That's going to be some at least 10s of basis points higher and RDS started that. SG&A, you know, if revenue picks up, we'll get SG&A leverage. So that kind of cut them the direction of what you're pushing towards.\nAdam Thalhimer: Yes.\nWilliam George: We'll get very good absorption. What was the other line you brought -- you mentioned?\nAdam Thalhimer: Well, G&A is probably the toughest one to know with the acquisitions.\nWilliam George: Well, yeah, although in a 10-K, you can go right back to the footnote and there's a table, and it'll tell you exactly what the amortization is going to be every quarter. That will be -- our amortization would've been a source of lifts for us this year, when we did a whole bunch of acquisitions late in the year, if not the amortization up but we haven't what is a very, very close estimate of that in our foot notes. That's going to hide a lot of that income. So what you're going to see is very good incremental increases to EBITDA and that's going to not filter down the EPS as quickly as it should. I should also say everything we've set up till now about earnings being similar with upside later in the year, kind of update stuff reflects the uncertainty it has baked into it. The uncertainty that we're talking about vis -a - vis supply chain and other issues. It also does not count the change in tax rates. The rules are very clear with this tax stuff that if you get an approval, you can't go back and push it into the prior year. So when we report the first quarter, like when I said we will be looking at our intervening years and we expect $22 million of income, we'll be doing a lot more work between now and when we report our first quarter. That number should be at least that big if not bigger. By then we will be able to start baking in to the forward stuff, the new lower tax rates. So there is some things that it's really important that people understand.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. That takes care of it.\nWilliam George: Yeah.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then, Brian, can you take us a little bit around the country and what you're seeing in the bidding environment.\nBrian Lane: Yeah, we will do. So in general, Adam, the bidding is very good in all parts of the country. In the Northeast, still very strong. If you take a look at Syracuse, New York, we're probably full up this year and it\u2019ll happen next year. A lot of plumbing, doing a lot of apartment buildings and healthcare. If you come down south as have seen a lot of manufacturing industrial prospects, we're really strong in the Southeast thanks to the companies that Bill has brought in. So see a lot of medical work, datacenter work. So I'm really enthused and upbeat Southeast down to Texas. Texas is very strong for us. Texas is doing very well. Dallas, Houston has now picked up pretty considerably in the last six months. Austin is extremely busy. And San Antonio, city that's growing considerably has a lot of data center work going on. So we're very optimistic about what's going on in Texas. West is -- it's probably where you will see a mixed bag for us. Denver, Phoenix is good. And we're a little bit smaller out there. But in general, the bidding opportunities is strong. If you look at where you look up here, this -- the larger jobs that will $5 million. I'm probably looking at more than I've looked at it in a long time. So we're pretty optimistic across the board.\nWilliam George: If you look at where things are and you say Gee, what would be operating if we didn't have things like the supply chain and inflation, it's pretty it's -- the fact that we can have this much confidence in our go-forward with all of the uncertainty which we're really are baking in, suggests that a little bit of good news would go a long way.\nBrian Lane: Yeah. We're really pleased with the workforce, even with the [Indiscernible] isn't due to do the illness that would keep it on schedule. So the folks out there doing the work of doing a Yeoman's effort to keep our customers happy.\nAdam Thalhimer: What are you seeing with COVID now? I mean, you said it impacted you in January.\nWilliam George: Yes. It's come down fast.\nBrian Lane: It's coming down fast.\nWilliam George: I mean, I don't know if anybody saying that. If you talk to our company president mid-February, there was a lot of people were talking about it mid and late January and we're actually --\nBrian Lane: --It's really quite a down\nWilliam George: It's disappeared. I mean, disappeared is too strong, but it's really [Indiscernible]\nAdam Thalhimer: I hope it does. That's good color.\nBrian Lane: Alright, thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. And your last question is from Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSean Eastman: Hey guys. My clarification question got answered, but I'm just going to hit you with one anyway. How should we think about the capacity of the business. We have a strong high-single-digit organic growth outlook in place for 2022. Could you feasibly flex to a number higher than that? And how would you characterize the labor situation? I guess the Omicron variant kind of muddies that up, but just underneath that, is it loosening up? Is it getting worse? How would you characterize that?\nBrian Lane: If you look at the labor, I think it's the same, it's tight. Another thing I think we have going for us, is that we're really good employer. And in the structure we have our people on all the local markets, know those markets really well. With that we're hitting the military, community colleges, folks in high school. We got some opportunities, maybe some lower income neighborhoods that's helping with some training and getting those folks involved in the business. So labor is tight. Kodiak is going to help us with some of the traveling folks. They've got a lot of good tradespeople, so we can flex it up, but you've got to manage your labor every day. And at the end of the day, you have to be a good place to work, training new people, etc. all of things that we are proud of what we do. So I can see that continuing on, Sean, so we'll just keep at it.\nSean Eastman: Got it. All right. Well, let you guys get back to business. Thanks for the time.\nBrian Lane: All right. Take care.\nWilliam George: Take care.\nOperator: All right, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back to Brian for his final remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. In closing, I want to again thank our hard working employees. We are glad we will be seeing many of you on the road again, hopefully. But in the meanwhile, thanks for your interest in the company. We really do appreciate it today. Please be safe and healthy and we will see you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. We have more information than usual to cover, but considering the events in Ukraine and Europe, we will try to be as efficient as possible and our thoughts are with those who are affected. We are pleased to report a strong finish to 2021. Our team has delivered excellent execution across our segments and we are grateful for their hard work. For the fourth quarter, we earned $1.4 per share on Revenue of $856 million. same-store Revenue grew by 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 as overall non-residential building construction and service continue to show broad-based strength. For the first time ever, we are reporting more than $3 billion in full-year revenues. We have good cash flow and our backlog has registered an unprecedented increase. In addition, in January of 2022, we received approvals of previously filed tax refund claims for the past years. That will meaningfully impact our first quarter results. And Bill will review those in detail during his remarks. We had an active fourth-quarter for acquisitions. At the beginning of December, we acquired IV Mechanical, which services customers across the Southeast and United States. We have known IV for 25 years and their Mechanical Construction and service expertise is well-positioned for collaboration and mutual benefits. On the last day of December, we acquired EDWARDS ELECTRICAL AND MECHANICAL based in Indiana. Edwards brings us a solid full-service presence in Indianapolis, and provides new capabilities in clean room solutions that will complement our off-site construction and pre -fabrication. On December 31, we also acquired a strong servicing controls business in Kentucky thermal solutions. And on that same day, we acquired Kodiak labor solutions, a temporary staffing agency that we have worked with on an ongoing basis and which will help us recruit and deploy skilled construction labor in many of our markets. We are happy to have these strong teams as a great new part of Comfort Systems USA. And we are confident that we have added some wonderful people and strong capabilities. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes. But first I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill. Hi, good morning Sean. I'll let Julie [Indiscernible] Sean. Yeah, it's a combination of both. We do have some larger projects that we're very optimistic about. But it's also broad based in terms of the ranges of the sizes.

            "name": "Trent Mckenna",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for 2022 and on inflation and supply chain considerations. Our backlog at the end of 2021 was $2.31 billion. And this is the first time that our backlog has exceeded $2 billion. Sequentially, our same-store backlog increased $224 million with strength in our modular work and in our electrical operations in Texas. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog is up by over $578 million or at 38%, a broadly-based increase. Industrial customers were 44% of our total revenue in 2021. We think this sector, which includes technology, life sciences, and food processing, will remain strong for us as industrial has heavily represented a new backlog, as well as in our recent larger acquisitions. Institutional markets, which include education, health care, and government, are also strong and represented 32% of our revenue. The commercial sector is also doing well. But with our changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 24% of revenue. Year-to-date construction was 78% of our revenue, with 46% from construction projects for new buildings, and 32% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service was strong this year. And our increasing service revenue was 22% of year-to-date revenue, with service projects providing 9% of revenue, and pure service, including hourly work, providing 13% of revenue. 2021 service revenue is up by 12%. And with our continuing strong margins, our service earnings were up by a similar amount. Overall, service continues to be a great source of profit for us.  As 2022 begins, we believe that we are returning to good ongoing market conditions and that we have largely recovered from negative impacts to our business due to business disruption caused by COVID-19. At the same time, we are experiencing inflation and some delays in materials and equipment. As we mentioned, supply chain and inflation were factors in 2021, especially in the fourth quarter. And we currently expect that those effects will continue through at least the first half of 2022. We are recognizing these challenges in our job planning and pricing, and we are working with our customers to share the risks and mitigate the effects of these challenges. In addition, during the first six weeks of 2022, we experienced temporary reductions and available labor as Omicron peaked. And that will also add some headwind to what we nevertheless expect will be a solid and profitable first quarter of 2022. We believe the good trends outweigh the challenges, and we remain optimistic about our prospects for 2022. The headwinds described above will likely be pronounced during the first half of 2022. However, our current belief and expectation is that in 2022 our full-year earnings in margins are likely to be comparable to 2021, with an opportunity for improvement as we get farther into our backlog as the year progresses. As we continue to emerge from the various effects of the pandemic, we believe that future demand in our key markets is strong, and we continue to invest in our workforce, technology, execution capabilities and in our service businesses. Underlying demand for our capabilities, especially in our key segments, including industrial and institutional buildings, continues to be very robust. Our fundamental outlook for the next several quarters is very positive, especially with our strong backlog and pipeline. We are happy with our investments today, and we are keen to continue to invest, grow and improve in our essential industry. Our skilled workforce is the heart and soul of Comfort Systems USA. And we will continue to develop and reward our unmatched team members as they strive each day to work safely, improve our communities, and provide the built infrastructure to serve our many markets. I will now turn it back to comments for questions. Thank you. I'll start and [Indiscernible] is Bill wants to follow up, but what gives us optimism is that the work and the opportunities is good, the margins are good in the work that we're winning. We're still executing in January. And as the year goes on. So I think we'll hit our average and margins will reflect 2022. I think we're managing as best we can the supply chain and inflation with our customers, and we are doing everything to satisfy them and be successful. Julio, what's really interesting they've only been here two months and we're already working on some joint projects with them. So this has started off really well."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker host today, Julie Shaeff Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Olivia. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's third quarter earnings call. Our comments this morning, as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of applicable securities laws and regulations. What we will say today is based on the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a more detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, as well as in our press release, covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are happy to report a fantastic third quarter. We earned $1.27 per share on revenue of $834 million. Same-store revenue grew by 9% compared to the third quarter of 2020, as work and bookings are returning as COVID challenges decrease. Our backlog was over $1.9 billion this quarter, which is a $270 million same-store increase over this time last year. Our free cash flow continues to be strong, and yesterday we increased our dividend by 8%. Our essential workforce continues to perform at an outstanding level, and we are grateful for their strength and perseverance during these challenging times. During the third quarter, we closed our acquisition of Amteck, which focuses on electrical projects and service in Kentucky, Tennessee and the Carolinas. Amteck brings an exceptional set of capabilities and relationships and a strong reputation in industrial markets, such as food processing. We are thrilled to have them as part of Comfort Systems USA. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes, but first, I'll turn this over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George: Thanks, Brian, and hello, everyone. This will be pretty brief. Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $834 million, an increase of $120 million or 17% compared to last year; same-store revenue increased by a strong 9%, with the remaining increase resulting from our acquisitions of TEC and Amteck. Gross profit this quarter was $159 million, a $12 million improvement compared to a year ago while gross profit percentage was 19.1% this quarter compared to 20.6% for the third quarter of 2020. Our gross profit percentage related to our Mechanical segment was strong at 20.1% and margins in the Electrical segment have increased significantly compared to last year. SG&A expense for the quarter was $95 million or 11.4% of revenue compared to $91 million or 12.7% of revenue for the third quarter in 2020. On a same-store basis, SG&A was down approximately $2 million, primarily due to tax consulting fees that we incurred in the prior year. Our year-to-date 2021 tax rate was in the expected range at 24.1%. Net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $46 million or $1.27 per share. This compares to net income for the third quarter of 2020 of $50 million or $1.36 per share, as last year included a $0.17 benefit that resulted when we settled tax audits from past years. Excluding that discrete item from last year, our earnings per share increased by 7% compared to the record level of a year ago. For our third quarter, EBITDA was up significantly to $82 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year. And through nine months, our EBITDA is $188 million. Free cash flow in the first nine months was $139 million, as compared to $199 million in 2020. The COVID-induced work slowdown and some temporary tax benefit created unprecedented cash flow last year. Our cash flow this year is robust through nine months and we expect continued good cash flow, although we are likely to continue to deploying some net working capital to start new projects in many places. In addition, we will be paying the federal government an extra $16 million of payroll taxes next quarter that were deferred under the CARES Act in 2020. Ongoing strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our debt faster than expected, while still actively repurchasing our stock. Since the beginning of the year, we have repurchased 346,000 shares which is almost 1% of our outstanding shares at an average price of $73.69. Since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back over 9.6 million shares at an average price of less than $22. Brian mentioned that we closed the acquisition of Amteck. Amteck is reported in our Electrical segment and it is expected to contribute annualized revenues of approximately $175 million to $200 million and earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization of $14 million to $17 million. However, because of the amortization expense related to intangibles, the acquisition is not expected to contribute to EPS for the next few quarters. That's all I have on financial Brian.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021 and full year 2022. Backlog at the end of the third quarter of 2021 was $1.94 billion. Our sequential same-store backlog was up slightly, which is great by the end of the third quarter due to the heavy backlog burn this time of the year. Year-over-year our backlog is up by over $500 million or 36%. Same-store backlog increased by 19%, a broad base increase. We believe that the impact on activity levels related to COVID-19 have now stabilized and we expect to continue seeing good trends in work availability in the coming quarters. Industrial customers were 43% of total revenue in the first nine months of 2021. We think this sector which includes technology, life sciences and food processing will remain strong for us, as Industrial is heavily represented in new backlog as well as in our recent acquisitions. Institutional markets, which include education health care and government are strong and represented 33% of our revenue. The commercial sector is also doing well but without changing mix it is now a smaller part of our business at about 24% of revenue. Year-to-date, construction was 77% of our revenue with 46% from construction projects for new buildings and 31% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service was very strong this quarter and our increasing service revenue was 23% of our year-to-date revenue with service projects providing 9% of revenue and pure service including hourly work providing 14% of revenue. Year-to-date service revenue was up by 11%. And with our continuing strong margins our service earnings were up by a similar amount. Service has rebounded as buildings are open and profitable small project activity is back. Overall, service continues to be a great source of profit for us. Finally, our outlook. Our backlog is at record levels. Project development and planning activities with our customers are continuing. We are paying more for materials but so far our teams have coped successfully with challenges in material availability and cost. We are closely monitoring material shortages and costs and are taking steps to add additional protections on new work. Vaccine mandates by certain customers have post challenges in our ability to pursue certain work. All the staff are maintained scheduling on work that is subject to such mandates. So far we have been able to meet our customers' requirements. However, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA is drafting an emergency regulation on vaccinations and it is impossible to predict the scope, timing and impact of the new regulation on us, or our industry or on the US economy. The underlying trends in customer demand and opportunities are very positive. And so despite challenges, we continue to anticipate solid earnings and cash flow for the remainder of 2021 and we feel that we have good prospects for 2022. Over the last few years, we completed a series of transformative acquisitions that have built upon our unbroken history of profitability and cash flow to increase our scale, deepen our exposure to complex markets, including industrial, technology and pharma and expand our recurring service revenue. Each investment has strengthened and expanded our unmatched nationwide community of skilled workers. We are also experiencing increasing benefits from our substantial and ongoing investments in training, productivity and technology. These acquisitions and other investments have laid the foundation for the current strong results and gives us confidence as we move forward. Above all, we are mindful of the ongoing challenges that our employees across the United States continue to confront and we are deeply grateful for their perseverance. We are committed to providing our workers and thus our customers with unmatched resources, opportunities and support. I will now turn it back over to Olivia for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nBrian Lane: You there Sean?\nOperator: Please check your mute button. And next question in queue coming from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey good morning guys. Congrats on a great quarter.\nBrian Lane: Hey, thanks Adam. Good morning.\nBill George: Adam you're not speechless.\nAdam Thalhimer: And there is no echo anymore.\nBrian Lane: There you go.\nAdam Thalhimer: Is it too early to have an outlook on just core non-res growth next year?\nBill George: Core non-res. Yeah, I mean I would say that we have a good opportunity to achieve better growth than we've achieved in the last several years. I think we would expect mid-single digit growth maybe with a little upside. We just had 9% but that was also -- a year ago we had some COVID effect still even though our third quarter last year was surprisingly good mid-single digits\u2026\nBrian Lane: Yeah, I'm -- we're optimistic going into next year, if you look at how much our service has grown, the strength of our backlog and still there's a lot of opportunities we are looking at. So 2022 will be in good shape.\nAdam Thalhimer: What are you seeing on the M&A front? \nBill George: So we keep saying that we'll probably take a pause, after we do these deals that are big for us. And I think that that's less likely now. There are some people we're talking to. So we're very mindful of changes in the capital gains rate. So I think we have an opportunity, to do some transaction, a transaction or some transactions in the next few months. I will say that we're pretty much only doing relationship deals right now, people we've talked to for a long time, who now have an interest. I think maybe it's a good time to sell with tax changes coming. We're not engaging in processes or bidding for companies. They're very -- it's a very frothy market for people chasing assets that are -- the kind of assets that can be put in an auction and we're not doing that.\nBrian Lane: Yes. Adam, as you know Bill, does all of our deals. And if we continue on what's happened in the last 10 years, it will be good for us.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then lastly, you had a nice uptick in backlog within Electrical. Can you talk a little -- was that, Walker? Can you talk a little bit about the outlook for Walker?\nBrian Lane: So I'll answer that one. I mean, Walker has done a terrific job this year. Basically, it will double their margins. They are in Texas and there's plenty of opportunities in Texas particularly Dallas, San Antonio and now Houston has picked up pretty steadily. So I think going forward the combination of their backlog and opportunities I think Walker is well poised to have a very good end of this year and a good 2022.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nBrian Lane: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nBrent Thielman: Hey. Thank you. Good morning.\nBrian Lane: Good morning, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: The service work looks like sort of collectively grew 10% this quarter. Brian, I just want to get your thoughts on whether you think you can sustain the sort of growth rates in that side of the business going forward?\nBill George: One thing, I would keep in mind remember service was kind of cut -- shut down a bit in the middle of last year. So this is a combination of a little bit of bounce back and really good growth.\nBrian Lane: Yes. I think Brent is -- you've been with us a long time and we've continued to invest in service both on the sales front and execution. So we will continue to grow that business pretty steadily mid-single digit a little bit more as we go forward. So that is a real source of strength now that we're consistently getting performance from.\nBrent Thielman: Brian any -- or Bill any thoughts on allocating more capital then you typically have to building up that business or continue as is?\nBrian Lane: I think we're going to continue it as is. So that we make sure that we keep our capability in line with customer expectations. We don't want to disappoint anyone. So we believe slow and steady growth make sure we keep our employees and our customers happy we can deliver a top shelf service to them.\nBill George: Right. And there's two ways we deploy capital. One is, investments in the existing business. We don't leave any opportunity behind to invest in the existing business. It's a very capital-light business but we do buy capital we've really invested in like handheld various technologies. And we also really invest in training like we have had -- we've been on -- we've just really been into training in all parts of our business and maybe especially service for years now. So we don't really -- there's not a dollar I know if we could invest that we don't invest. When it comes to acquisitions we really just buy the best available company and we love it. It is definitely a plus if they have a nice service business. But if they can also go build complex food plants like Amteck we love that too. We just keep -- try to keep doing what works. And we love, we love great workforces complex capabilities geographies where you're really, people have to drive a long way to find somebody who can do what you can do. Those are the kind of things we love.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. That's great. And I think this is kind of a follow-up to Adam's question, but you talked a lot about the industrial vertical and it's obviously, been fantastic for you. I just want to get a pulse on some of these other markets you're in and I know they're shrinking as a percentage of the pie, but looking at this sector this quarter areas like education were down a couple of other verticals in there that were down. Do you think, we'll be in a place in 2022 where some of these areas see a more material turn?\nBrian Lane: Yeah. I just think, it's down percentage but they're actually growing in real dollars. Education has been pretty consistent for us, particularly at the university level as you know. We got some K-12 work, and I think you'll get some IQ opportunities as we go on. Medical's picked up for us. We got some good growth in our backlog in medical. And in commercial buildings, it's more on the service and tenant fit-out type work. So the other markets a good slight growth with industrial obviously with the most growth opportunity. Bill?\nBill George: I agree.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Just the last one I guess is just on the electrical margins, I mean, you've seen some real stability here this year in terms of what you reported there. And any thoughts kind of going forward these are really \u2013 sustain level?\nBill George: Yeah. So this is an opportunity for Comfort Systems, right? So Walker, have very significant improvement. But keep in mind, we've also bought some really good electrical companies, and they are now in that segment, and they bring in very, very good margins. So it's probably \u2013 it's unlikely probably that, we will get to overall electrical margins that are as high as our overall mechanical margins on average, over long periods of time in part because of the service component is a little bigger in mechanical. But I really like our opportunity to continue to pull a little bit of the improvement out of electrical. Remember, what Brian said about Walker, Walker has got good opportunities, and that's really true in all of our businesses, and it's true in electrical and they probably \u2013 as a segment, it probably has a little more room to get better.\nBrian Lane: Yeah, Brent. Just \u2013 I mean, we're really happy with the electrical business and what we see the future of. I think that's going to be a really strong element for Comfort Systems on a long-term basis.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question coming from the line of Julio Romero with Sidoti. Your line is open.\nJulio Romero: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nBrian Lane: Hey, good morning.\nJulio Romero: I wanted to ask about the order trends. They've obviously trended very nicely. We've seen sequential growth for four straight quarters. How do you expect to see orders trend over the next couple of quarters? And are you at this point kind of turning down any projects at all?\nBill George: Our booking season usually is the winter, and that's not changed. So we have \u2013 I think as far as the timing we never \u2013 we can't really control when the pieces of the paper gets finalized. But over the next six months, I think we have \u2013 the bookings should continue to get better, the next sort of the net bookings and pricing is good in those bookings. We are \u2013 when we're busy we're picky. And also right now, there are some places where we're not pursuing work where there might be a vaccine mandate, although you were hearing more about that 30 days ago than you are now. But in part, we're doing that, because we can, right?\nBrian Lane: Yeah. Julio, just to follow-on that, I think the discipline we're maintaining on no go, go no go what our projects to take. I think the operating folks are really doing a terrific job, about what opportunities to pursue and maybe wants to pass over. So I'm really pleased with how that's going.\nJulio Romero: Got it. Yeah, being picky is certainly a good thing in this market. And I guess, you mentioned not being as attractive to areas where there may be some vaccine mandates. Are you seeing any other kind of bottlenecks on the labor side vaccines, or any other bottleneck that you may be seeing?\nBill George: So there are places with certain types of customers we're talking a lot about vaccine mandates, especially 30 or 60 days ago. And we are making good progress in seeing more of our workforce vaccinated, but our workforce is they're in a cohort that has lower vaccination rates than the national average. And so when we look at work that requires a vaccine, we look at what we have in the way of availability and which -- what our workforce looks like and we decide whether that's a good project to pursue and we take that also -- have to take that into account in our pricing. As far as other bottlenecks our bottleneck is always labor right Brian?\nBrian Lane: Yes, it's always a labor Julio and we -- luckily we have a lot of folks working here and they're managing across companies as best we're constantly in the market looking for good people. So, we're managing it like we've done for 50 years.\nBill George: By the way just about vaccine mandates this is not a Comfort Systems' issue, right? This is a U.S. United States issue if the federal government when they promulgate those regulations decides to sit down somewhere between 15% and 40% of our blue-collar workforce that's going to have -- that's going to affect the nation. Comfort Systems actually we're well positioned for that. 25% of our revenue is in Texas. Our next biggest state is Florida. So these are -- we think we're actually very well positioned for the worst case of that compared to anybody you could compare it to that we know of. But having said that it does feel like it's trending towards sort of there are more people getting vaccinated and there's customers are sort of looking at different ways of keeping their job sites safe.\nJulio Romero: Got it. So I guess any industry pain points where everyone's feeling labor tightness might in some way play to your advantage on a competitive balance?\nBill George: It happened in the past.\nBrian Lane: Yes, it happened in the past. And Julio we're a good employer. We're good to work. So we're very attractive to folks out there that want to do a mechanical electrical plumbing type work.\nJulio Romero: Understood. Congrats on a nice quarter and best of luck in 4Q.\nBrian Lane: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question coming from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nSean Eastman: Can you guys hear me this time?\nBrian Lane: Yes.\nSean Eastman: Just wanted to keep you on your toes there. So just out of curiosity what -- do you have a sense for the vaccination rate of Comfort Systems workforce? \nBill George: That's really -- the thing about Comfort is there isn't a workforce for Comfort Systems. There's workforces in Massachusetts and there's workforces in Florida. And so I would say that overall I'd say, we're definitely above our -- people think our industry is about 50% vaccinated. In my opinion we're above the industry average for that. We've done a lot to try to make that happen. And also sometimes people don't necessarily -- they can be vaccinated and not reported, right? There are times when you're in a melee where you don't want to admit that you're vaccinated. So It's hard to measure.\nBrian Lane: But in terms of that, Sean we're making it really easy for folks to get vaccinated that are working here.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Interesting. And then a higher level one for me this -- over this past quarter we saw a few of the big OEMs highlight these huge addressable market opportunities surrounding energy efficiency that it seems to be in addition to the IAQ solutions demand. And just considering all these net zero pledges coming out of both the private sector and the public sector, I wondered if that's something Comfort Systems is positioning around?\nBill George: I actually -- we don't usually sort of talk about huge activities. But our guys -- we're in a lot of geographies that with the right expertise and capabilities to benefit from some of the trends that this is driving for example, electric vehicles. Historically Comfort is not involved in the automobile industry. But if you need to build batteries, if you need sort of sophisticated electronics, an awful lot of that is right in our wheelhouse and it's right in the geographies that we're in. And we're actually -- like I've been in planning meetings lately just at the subsidiaries where they are starting to the opportunities like that with code names on their boards. And so, I do think anything they give the United States a reason to reconfigure things and to redeploy things we're the guys who can help you do that.\nBrian Lane: And Sean, this is in theory. We are actually working on a project right now for the maker of electric batteries so.\nBill George: It's real life. We got real work with revenue and profit. So you put that on top of life sciences which are good. And then, various other types of technology -- we're in technology and a lot of this is technology-driven. So we think, we're actually pretty -- we think they are good. In addition to internal air quality we think there are other good things right in the heart of our complex, sort of industrial expertise, that are being that have good prospects because of these changes.\nBrian Lane: And what's great about our workforce is we're very adaptable to work on multi-type facility, Sean. It's a real strength of ours.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That's really interesting. And I wanted to check in on the modular business as well. I mean, I felt like the longer-term play there was helping to address the sort of structural labor shortage. Obviously, that seems to be quite an acute situation right now. How is that playing out for you guys? I just wondered, maybe on the flip side of that, that business could be a little more susceptible to some of the capacity constraints just around shipping and things like that, but wanted to check back in on that business.\nBill George: Yeah. I would say we definitely have had to put more money in just shipping and quotes for shipping.\nSean Eastman: Yeah.\nBill George: A lot of what we sell is -- some of the biggest stuff is, sort of the buyer ships it. Also, it's an opportunity to improve your labor, utilization on certain types of projects. It's 10% of revenue. It was a nice. It was very profitable this quarter. It was you'd like -- I might have highlighted how well it did this quarter, but pretty much the whole business did well. You have been highlighting everything but we had a really nice quarter in off-site construction and modular. And we feel like we're doing a good job beginning to find new customers and help them understand how this can help them. But this is the kind of -- this is a strategic thing that you do with five-year plans not two quarter plans. And we've got some really, really good people working together between our two big off-site construction things. And they've got a good plan for the coming years. But I mean, we're excited about it.\nBrian Lane: Yeah. And that into the business Sean, we got great leadership locally terrific workforce, they're applying technology, advancements in welding, what they're doing is tremendously exciting to me. I love going there. And I think they'll just keep getting better and better.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Good update there. And then, you guys are clearly boasting about the success of the acquisition program here on this call, I think rightfully so. We kind of touched on how the program has sort of helped position you guys in these growth end markets where you've got these secular drivers, but to the extent you can comment if you just look back over the last five years or even 10 years, I mean, what kind of cash returns have you seen from the acquisition program?\nBrian Lane: I'm going to let Bill, answer that one.\nBill George: That's embarrassing answer. No. The -- it's been fantastic. Like these companies -- so we haven't bought a company of any size since 2008 that hasn't met on average the projections we have today, we bought it. And some of them have exceeded those projections by multiples of what we planned on getting when we bought them. They all they actually do better they also -- they help our cash flow much more than they help our earnings, because there's so much amortization in the first few years from these companies. And that's one of the reasons why\u2026\nBrian Lane: Have we loose Sean?\nBill George: I don't know.\nOperator: Now, I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Brian Lane, for any closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thank you very much. And in closing, I want to again, thank our hard working employees. They're doing just a terrific job. We are glad we'll be seeing many of you again in person soon. But in the meanwhile, please be safe. Enjoy the rest of your day. And thank you very much.\nBill George: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that ends our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Okay. Thanks Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are happy to report a fantastic third quarter. We earned $1.27 per share on revenue of $834 million. Same-store revenue grew by 9% compared to the third quarter of 2020, as work and bookings are returning as COVID challenges decrease. Our backlog was over $1.9 billion this quarter, which is a $270 million same-store increase over this time last year. Our free cash flow continues to be strong, and yesterday we increased our dividend by 8%. Our essential workforce continues to perform at an outstanding level, and we are grateful for their strength and perseverance during these challenging times. During the third quarter, we closed our acquisition of Amteck, which focuses on electrical projects and service in Kentucky, Tennessee and the Carolinas. Amteck brings an exceptional set of capabilities and relationships and a strong reputation in industrial markets, such as food processing. We are thrilled to have them as part of Comfort Systems USA. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes, but first, I'll turn this over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? All right. Thanks, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021 and full year 2022.

Each investment has strengthened and expanded our unmatched nationwide community of skilled workers. We are also experiencing increasing benefits from our substantial and ongoing investments in training, productivity and technology. These acquisitions and other investments have laid the foundation for the current strong results and gives us confidence as we move forward. Above all, we are mindful of the ongoing challenges that our employees across the United States continue to confront and we are deeply grateful for their perseverance. We are committed to providing our workers and thus our customers with unmatched resources, opportunities and support. I will now turn it back over to Olivia for questions. Thank you. You there Sean? Hey, thanks Adam. Good morning. There you go. Yeah, I'm -- we're optimistic going into next year, if you look at how much our service has grown, the strength of our backlog and still there's a lot of opportunities we are looking at. So 2022 will be in good shape. Yes. Adam, as you know Bill, does all of our deals. And if we continue on what's happened in the last 10 years, it will be good for us. So I'll answer that one. I mean, Walker has done a terrific job this year. Basically, it will double their margins. They are in Texas and there's plenty of opportunities in Texas particularly Dallas, San Antonio and now Houston has picked up pretty steadily. So I think going forward the combination of their backlog and opportunities I think Walker is well poised to have a very good end of this year and a good 2022. Thanks, Adam. Good morning, Brent. Yes. I think Brent is -- you've been with us a long time and we've continued to invest in service both on the sales front and execution. So we will continue to grow that business pretty steadily mid-single digit a little bit more as we go forward. So that is a real source of strength now that we're consistently getting performance from. I think we're going to continue it as is. So that we make sure that we keep our capability in line with customer expectations. We don't want to disappoint anyone. So we believe slow and steady growth make sure we keep our employees and our customers happy we can deliver a top shelf service to them. Yeah. I just think, it's down percentage but they're actually growing in real dollars. Education has been pretty consistent for us, particularly at the university level as you know. We got some K-12 work, and I think you'll get some IQ opportunities as we go on. Medical's picked up for us. We got some good growth in our backlog in medical. And in commercial buildings, it's more on the service and tenant fit-out type work. So the other markets a good slight growth with industrial obviously with the most growth opportunity. Bill? Yeah, Brent. Just \u2013 I mean, we're really happy with the electrical business and what we see the future of. I think that's going to be a really strong element for Comfort Systems on a long-term basis. All right. Thanks. Hey, good morning. Yeah. Julio, just to follow-on that, I think the discipline we're maintaining on no go, go no go what our projects to take. I think the operating folks are really doing a terrific job, about what opportunities to pursue and maybe wants to pass over. So I'm really pleased with how that's going. Yes, it's always a labor Julio and we -- luckily we have a lot of folks working here and they're managing across companies as best we're constantly in the market looking for good people. So, we're managing it like we've done for 50 years. Yes, it happened in the past. And Julio we're a good employer. We're good to work. So we're very attractive to folks out there that want to do a mechanical electrical plumbing type work. Thank you very much. Yes. But in terms of that, Sean we're making it really easy for folks to get vaccinated that are working here. And Sean, this is in theory. We are actually working on a project right now for the maker of electric batteries so. And what's great about our workforce is we're very adaptable to work on multi-type facility, Sean. It's a real strength of ours. Yeah. And that into the business Sean, we got great leadership locally terrific workforce, they're applying technology, advancements in welding, what they're doing is tremendously exciting to me. I love going there. And I think they'll just keep getting better and better. I'm going to let Bill, answer that one. Have we loose Sean? All right. Thank you very much. And in closing, I want to again, thank our hard working employees. They're doing just a terrific job. We are glad we'll be seeing many of you again in person soon. But in the meanwhile, please be safe. Enjoy the rest of your day. And thank you very much."

            "name": "Bill George",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and hello, everyone. This will be pretty brief. Revenue for the third quarter of 2021 was $834 million, an increase of $120 million or 17% compared to last year; same-store revenue increased by a strong 9%, with the remaining increase resulting from our acquisitions of TEC and Amteck. Gross profit this quarter was $159 million, a $12 million improvement compared to a year ago while gross profit percentage was 19.1% this quarter compared to 20.6% for the third quarter of 2020. Our gross profit percentage related to our Mechanical segment was strong at 20.1% and margins in the Electrical segment have increased significantly compared to last year. SG&A expense for the quarter was $95 million or 11.4% of revenue compared to $91 million or 12.7% of revenue for the third quarter in 2020. On a same-store basis, SG&A was down approximately $2 million, primarily due to tax consulting fees that we incurred in the prior year. Our year-to-date 2021 tax rate was in the expected range at 24.1%. Net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $46 million or $1.27 per share. This compares to net income for the third quarter of 2020 of $50 million or $1.36 per share, as last year included a $0.17 benefit that resulted when we settled tax audits from past years. Excluding that discrete item from last year, our earnings per share increased by 7% compared to the record level of a year ago. For our third quarter, EBITDA was up significantly to $82 million, an increase of 15% over the prior year. And through nine months, our EBITDA is $188 million. Free cash flow in the first nine months was $139 million, as compared to $199 million in 2020. The COVID-induced work slowdown and some temporary tax benefit created unprecedented cash flow last year. Our cash flow this year is robust through nine months and we expect continued good cash flow, although we are likely to continue to deploying some net working capital to start new projects in many places. In addition, we will be paying the federal government an extra $16 million of payroll taxes next quarter that were deferred under the CARES Act in 2020. Ongoing strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our debt faster than expected, while still actively repurchasing our stock. Since the beginning of the year, we have repurchased 346,000 shares which is almost 1% of our outstanding shares at an average price of $73.69. Since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back over 9.6 million shares at an average price of less than $22. Brian mentioned that we closed the acquisition of Amteck. Amteck is reported in our Electrical segment and it is expected to contribute annualized revenues of approximately $175 million to $200 million and earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization of $14 million to $17 million. However, because of the amortization expense related to intangibles, the acquisition is not expected to contribute to EPS for the next few quarters. That's all I have on financial Brian. Adam you're not speechless. Core non-res. Yeah, I mean I would say that we have a good opportunity to achieve better growth than we've achieved in the last several years. I think we would expect mid-single digit growth maybe with a little upside. We just had 9% but that was also -- a year ago we had some COVID effect still even though our third quarter last year was surprisingly good mid-single digits... So we keep saying that we'll probably take a pause, after we do these deals that are big for us. And I think that that's less likely now. There are some people we're talking to. So we're very mindful of changes in the capital gains rate. So I think we have an opportunity, to do some transaction, a transaction or some transactions in the next few months. I will say that we're pretty much only doing relationship deals right now, people we've talked to for a long time, who now have an interest. I think maybe it's a good time to sell with tax changes coming. We're not engaging in processes or bidding for companies. They're very -- it's a very frothy market for people chasing assets that are -- the kind of assets that can be put in an auction and we're not doing that. One thing, I would keep in mind remember service was kind of cut -- shut down a bit in the middle of last year. So this is a combination of a little bit of bounce back and really good growth. Right. And there's two ways we deploy capital. One is, investments in the existing business. We don't leave any opportunity behind to invest in the existing business. It's a very capital-light business but we do buy capital we've really invested in like handheld various technologies. And we also really invest in training like we have had -- we've been on -- we've just really been into training in all parts of our business and maybe especially service for years now. So we don't really -- there's not a dollar I know if we could invest that we don't invest. When it comes to acquisitions we really just buy the best available company and we love it. It is definitely a plus if they have a nice service business. But if they can also go build complex food plants like Amteck we love that too. We just keep -- try to keep doing what works. And we love, we love great workforces complex capabilities geographies where you're really, people have to drive a long way to find somebody who can do what you can do. Those are the kind of things we love. I agree. Yeah. So this is an opportunity for Comfort Systems, right? So Walker, have very significant improvement. But keep in mind, we've also bought some really good electrical companies, and they are now in that segment, and they bring in very, very good margins. So it's probably \u2013 it's unlikely probably that, we will get to overall electrical margins that are as high as our overall mechanical margins on average, over long periods of time in part because of the service component is a little bigger in mechanical. But I really like our opportunity to continue to pull a little bit of the improvement out of electrical. Remember, what Brian said about Walker, Walker has got good opportunities, and that's really true in all of our businesses, and it's true in electrical and they probably \u2013 as a segment, it probably has a little more room to get better. Our booking season usually is the winter, and that's not changed. So we have \u2013 I think as far as the timing we never \u2013 we can't really control when the pieces of the paper gets finalized. But over the next six months, I think we have \u2013 the bookings should continue to get better, the next sort of the net bookings and pricing is good in those bookings. We are \u2013 when we're busy we're picky. And also right now, there are some places where we're not pursuing work where there might be a vaccine mandate, although you were hearing more about that 30 days ago than you are now. But in part, we're doing that, because we can, right? So there are places with certain types of customers we're talking a lot about vaccine mandates, especially 30 or 60 days ago. And we are making good progress in seeing more of our workforce vaccinated, but our workforce is they're in a cohort that has lower vaccination rates than the national average. And so when we look at work that requires a vaccine, we look at what we have in the way of availability and which -- what our workforce looks like and we decide whether that's a good project to pursue and we take that also -- have to take that into account in our pricing. As far as other bottlenecks our bottleneck is always labor right Brian? By the way just about vaccine mandates this is not a Comfort Systems' issue, right? This is a U.S. United States issue if the federal government when they promulgate those regulations decides to sit down somewhere between 15% and 40% of our blue-collar workforce that's going to have -- that's going to affect the nation. Comfort Systems actually we're well positioned for that. 25% of our revenue is in Texas. Our next biggest state is Florida. So these are -- we think we're actually very well positioned for the worst case of that compared to anybody you could compare it to that we know of. But having said that it does feel like it's trending towards sort of there are more people getting vaccinated and there's customers are sort of looking at different ways of keeping their job sites safe. It happened in the past. That's really -- the thing about Comfort is there isn't a workforce for Comfort Systems. There's workforces in Massachusetts and there's workforces in Florida. And so I would say that overall I'd say, we're definitely above our -- people think our industry is about 50% vaccinated. In my opinion we're above the industry average for that. We've done a lot to try to make that happen. And also sometimes people don't necessarily -- they can be vaccinated and not reported, right? There are times when you're in a melee where you don't want to admit that you're vaccinated. So It's hard to measure. I actually -- we don't usually sort of talk about huge activities. But our guys -- we're in a lot of geographies that with the right expertise and capabilities to benefit from some of the trends that this is driving for example, electric vehicles. Historically Comfort is not involved in the automobile industry. But if you need to build batteries, if you need sort of sophisticated electronics, an awful lot of that is right in our wheelhouse and it's right in the geographies that we're in. And we're actually -- like I've been in planning meetings lately just at the subsidiaries where they are starting to the opportunities like that with code names on their boards. And so, I do think anything they give the United States a reason to reconfigure things and to redeploy things we're the guys who can help you do that. It's real life. We got real work with revenue and profit. So you put that on top of life sciences which are good. And then, various other types of technology -- we're in technology and a lot of this is technology-driven. So we think, we're actually pretty -- we think they are good. In addition to internal air quality we think there are other good things right in the heart of our complex, sort of industrial expertise, that are being that have good prospects because of these changes. Yeah. I would say we definitely have had to put more money in just shipping and quotes for shipping. A lot of what we sell is -- some of the biggest stuff is, sort of the buyer ships it. Also, it's an opportunity to improve your labor, utilization on certain types of projects. It's 10% of revenue. It was a nice. It was very profitable this quarter. It was you'd like -- I might have highlighted how well it did this quarter, but pretty much the whole business did well. You have been highlighting everything but we had a really nice quarter in off-site construction and modular. And we feel like we're doing a good job beginning to find new customers and help them understand how this can help them. But this is the kind of -- this is a strategic thing that you do with five-year plans not two quarter plans. And we've got some really, really good people working together between our two big off-site construction things. And they've got a good plan for the coming years. But I mean, we're excited about it. That's embarrassing answer. No. The -- it's been fantastic. Like these companies -- so we haven't bought a company of any size since 2008 that hasn't met on average the projections we have today, we bought it. And some of them have exceeded those projections by multiples of what we planned on getting when we bought them. They all they actually do better they also -- they help our cash flow much more than they help our earnings, because there's so much amortization in the first few years from these companies. And that's one of the reasons why... I don't know. Thanks everyone."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call to Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks Charlie. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's second quarter earnings call. Our comments this morning as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. What we will say today is based upon the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer, Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thank you Julie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are happy to report an excellent second quarter. We earned $0.90 per share despite some revenue headwinds arising from pandemic-related delays in some areas and projects. Our sequential backlog increased by $180 million this quarter on a same-store basis and our year-over-year same-store backlog also increased by $200 million. And this is the first time since the pandemic declined that we have seen a same-store increase in our backlog from the prior year. These increases support our belief that direct pandemic effects are abating. Our free cash flow continues to be strong and yesterday we increased our dividend. Our essential workforce proved its mettle during the recent challenges and they continue to excel as circumstances improve. We are grateful for their strength and perseverance. We are optimistic about our prospects for the next several quarters. We recently announced that Amteck will be joining Comfort Systems USA and that acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter. Amteck provides electrical contracting solutions and services, including core electric and low-voltage systems as well as services for planned of maintenance, retrofit and emergency work. Amteck is headquartered in Kentucky and focuses on the Southeastern United States, including Kentucky, Tennessee and the Carolinas. Amteck brings experienced professionals and a fantastic reputation for electrical contracting and services in industrial markets such as food processing. Amteck will add world-class capabilities in complex projects, deep customer relationships, design-build confidence and opportunities for synergy. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes, but first I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George: Thanks Brian. Before I review second quarter details, I want to discuss the impact of COVID and how that has affected the composition and timing of earnings and revenues so far this year and in the comparable period last year. Our first quarter results in 2020 were lowered by COVID. As we closed that quarter last year in the midst of governmental orders in building and job shutdowns, we were very concerned about how the pandemic and work precautions would affect our productivity. Accordingly, the judgments we made to close the first quarter last year led us to expect higher cost on jobs and reduced margins and we also reserved certain receivables. Three months later, by the time we were closing our second quarter, it had become clear that our activities were deemed essential and that we could work at good productivity levels or would be paid for lost productivity in most cases. As a result, we reassessed some cautious estimates and partially as a result of those judgments, the second quarter of 2020 was particularly robust. We continued to benefit from those factors in last year's second quarter as well and the third quarter of 2020 also benefited from a very discrete gain relating to the settlement of open issues with the IRS for our 2014 and 2015 tax years. As a result, although underlying trends are strengthening, we continue to face tough comparables in the third quarter. Now during the first half of this year and a year later, we have good execution and productivity. However, we have had some revenue softness due to delays in work preparation and pre-construction due to the pandemic. We are also towards the end of closing out some work that was performed under the worst conditions of the pandemic. And so the margins we achieved this quarter reflect a little of that headwind. Fortunately, those effects are subsiding and our research and backlog and active pipeline is a sign of good demand and prospects. And so with that background and context, let me review the numbers in more detail. Revenue for the 2021 second quarter was $714 million, a decrease of $30 million compared to last year and our same-store revenue declined by $46 million. Gross profit this quarter was $126 million, lower by $19 million. And gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined to 17.7% this quarter compared to 19.6% for the second quarter of 2020. Our gross profit this quarter reflected the headwinds that we are experiencing in construction, particularly in our mechanical segment. If you compare the six months period this year to the same period in 2020, gross profit was 18.1% for the first six months of 2021, which is roughly equivalent to 18.2% for the first half of 2020. SG&A expense for the quarter was $88 million or 12.3% of revenue, compared to $85 million or 11.4% of revenue for the same quarter in 2020. On a same-store basis, SG&A was similar to last year with a same-store increase of $1 million. Our 2021 tax rate was 23.8% compared to 27.6% in 2020. Our quarterly tax rate benefited from permanent differences related to stock-based compensation and we expect a more normal rate in the second half of the year. Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $33 million or $0.90 per share. And that result included $0.10 of income related to the revaluation of our contingent earnout obligations. We have four large earnouts active in 2021. And so we expect more variability than usual in earnout valuations this year. Our net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $39 million or $1.08 per share. For our second quarter, EBITDA was $55 million and year-to-date we have $106 million of EBITDA. Free cash flow in the first six months was $101 million as compared to $151 million for the first half of 2020. The slowdown and some temporary tax benefits created unprecedented cash flow last year. Our cash flow is very strong through six months. But as activity levels improve, we are likely to continue deploying some working capital to start new projects in many of our geographies. Ongoing strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our debt faster than expected and also to remain active in repurchasing our stock and we have reduced our outstanding share count for five consecutive years. Brian mentioned that we recently entered into an agreement to acquire Amteck and that transaction is expected to close shortly and during the third quarter. We have not yet closed Amteck, so no revenue or backlog is yet included. Amteck will be included in our electrical segment and it is expected to contribute annualized revenues of approximately $175 million to $200 million and EBITDA of $14 million to $17 million. In light of the required amortization expense related to intangibles and other costs associated with that transaction, the acquisition is expected to make a neutral to slightly accretive contribution to earnings per share for the first 12 months to 18 months. So that's all I have on financials, Brian.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021. New bookings significantly exceeded backlog performed during the second quarter. Backlog at the end of the second quarter of 2021 was $1.84 billion. We believe that the business impacts relating to COVID-19 have now stabilized and as a result same-store backlog increased sequentially by 11% or $180 million. That is a strong increase, particularly for the second quarter. The increase is broad based with strength across our markets, most notably, in industrial projects. Although delays might modestly impact activity levels for the third quarter, we see strong underlying trends in the coming quarters and we are comfortable with the backlog we have across our operating locations. Our industrial activities were 42% of total revenue in the first half of 2021. We think this sector will continue growing as the majority of the revenues at our new companies of TAS and TEC are industrial and because industrial is heavily represented in new backlog. Institutional markets, which include education, healthcare and the government, are strong and were 33% of our revenue. The commercial sector is also solid but with our changing mix, it is now about 25% of our revenue. For the first six months of 2021, construction was 77% of our revenue with 46% from construction projects for new buildings and 31% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service was a great story this quarter and service revenue was 23% of year-to-date revenue with service projects providing 9% of revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 14% of revenue. Year-to-date service revenue is up approximately 12% with improved profitability. Service has now rebounded to full activity levels. Buildings are open. Profitable small project activity is back and we continue to help customers with their indoor air quality. Overall, service was a major source of profit for us this quarter and really helped to offset the temporary air pockets in construction. Our mechanical segment continues to perform well, despite being most impacted by the pandemic-related air pockets. Our electrical gross margins improved from 6.5% in the first six months of 2020 to 14.3% this year. Finally, our outlook. Our backlog grew this quarter and strength is returning. Project development and planning activities continue to be strong with our customers. We are confident in recent acquisitions and are excited about the pending addition of Amteck. We also continue to invest in our workforce and businesses in order to grow earnings and cash flow. For the balance of 2021, the pandemic recovery will continue to affect revenue timing and work and we also faced a tough third quarter comparison as Bill mentioned. As work picks up, we will be impacted by timing and we will invest some working capital in order to ramp up. For the next few quarters, we will have relatively fewer closeouts also. We are paying more for materials. But so far material availability and increases have been manageable. We are closely monitoring material shortages and costs and are taking steps to add additional protections on new work. All of these considerations make it hard to predict exactly how the next quarter or two will unfold. But the underlying trends and opportunities are very positive. Despite some moving pieces in carryover effects in the near term, we look forward to continued profitability and our increased backlog and strong pipeline indicate that we can expect stronger activity levels later this year and into 2022. We are optimistic about finishing 2021 on a strong note and we are even more optimistic about 2022. Thank you once again to our employees for your hard work and dedication. I will now turn it back over to Charlie for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nSean Eastman: Hi team. Thanks for taking my questions.\nBrian Lane: Good morning Sean.\nSean Eastman: Good morning guys. So Brian, in your prepared remarks there, you are talking about being confident in the second half and then even more confident in 2022. It's kind of unusual for you guys to speak about the out-year so bullishly, right. So obviously we saw a great bookings in the second quarter but maybe beyond that, what's really underpinning that confidence, especially considering we have got some of the supply chain and labor availability uncertainty here?\nBrian Lane: Yes. Well, I think, first of all, Sean we are seeing a lot of opportunity still throughout the country. It's work we like, work we are good at. So that gives me a lot of confidence that we will be able to execute well in the field. And as far as we can see, that's going to continue for the rest of this year into next year. There's multitude of opportunities. Particularly, if you look at the industrial sector, data centers, pharma, medical facilities, labs, food processing, medical in general on the retrofit side and some new buildings and education. So I am pretty confident what we are seeing and I think the momentum will continue. I guess your question about the materials and labor. I am sure it's well documented. But I think we are doing a really good job managing it on the material front, in particular. We have really good relationships with our vendors, a long history with them which we pay them fairly and we pay them on time. And we will let them know what's coming as early as we can and all of us are on the phone with them. So I mean, we are going to manage our way through. We have been through tight times before. None of us are new at this. And of course on the labor front, you do everything you can. I think stuff like pre-fabrication and modular helps us reduce our dependence a little bit on labor. But we recruit and bringing them in, training them. But I am pretty optimistic. We have got a lot of well-seasoned professionals out there doing the work and we will get through it.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That's helpful Brian. And another high-level one from me is, you pointed out this big shift in mix we have seen over the past several years with industrial overtaking commercial in a big way. I think that's been deliberate with acquisitions being a big part of that. You have also invested heavily in service over the past several years. So just in that context, as we are looking at our forecasts into a positive inflection in activity, I mean, what do we really need to consider in our models considering that big shift in the profile and mix of business?\nBrian Lane: As far as your model goes, I don't know, but the most important things about those changes are, in the complex space you have a much better opportunity to get reliable margins and to charge for the labor that we have that's really what you invest in when you buy Comfort Systems stock is group of people who can do hard things. I am not sure it really changes the modeling. I do think that industrial will go up for the rest of this year, but almost certainly just because we will have a full year of two companies that are virtually 100% industrial. And as Amteck comes in, they have a richer industrial mix than we have on average. And they have particular expertise in things like food processing and certain types of industrial facilities that really we didn't have a lot of exposure to. And a really great sort of it shaped the geography where we are really excellent at this stuff, a little bit to the chasing our sweet spot of the greater Southeast but shades us a little more to the west of the Southeast in some areas that we think are just really, really attractive in the coming years.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That's helpful. And last one for me is, this is the one of the lower gross margin prints we have seen in some time from you guys. Could you just walk us through some of the moving pieces there? It sounds like no real change in margin expectations on a go-forward is my sense.\nBrian Lane: Yes. If you look at where we are at the year-to-date, we are over 18%, Sean. I mean, you look at the three month timeframe, I think we are really executing really well in the field. I think we will be back to our normal spot. I think this is just a one quarter decline in my opinion.\nBill George: Yes. You think about it a year with all the craziness over the last year, right. One of the things that happened last year was people had to work out on job sites with masks on and they could flow fewer people in an elevator and just more distance and longer timeframe to just get on to the job site as you were getting your temperature taken. So even though a year ago, we found out we could still work with good productivity, that doesn't mean it doesn't affect somebody. If they have to wait 10 extra minutes to get in and we are paying them, that's 10 minutes of lost productivity. So I think that on many of our jobs, we had some lost productivity. It's just that we had money in our cost codes to cover it. But when you get to the end of the job, we are finishing a lot of those jobs, that's still going to affect how much of a pickup you are going to have at the end, right. And also, we are in a period of time when we have a little bit, we have some sporadic air pockets in places where they are about to get really busy. And as you might imagine, if you have got, well, there isn't pipe fitters and plumbers and master electricians, you are going to usually pretty slow to lay those guys off when you are facing a giant amount of work. So I think what you are seeing is an amazing outcome as our guys are managing through an inflection point a little bit and a little bit of an air pocket. And we are thrilled to make a ton of money and be positioned the way we are.\nBrian Lane: Yes,. I couldn't be happier with the way we are performing in construction and service right now.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks guys.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks Sean.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hi. Good morning guys.\nBrian Lane: Good morning Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Bill or Brian, how are building owners or people thinking about building a building thinking about rising materials prices?\nBill George: So as far as we can tell, when you talk to virtually any of our companies, there's still a ton of planning going on, right. So I think, nobody likes it when they have to pay more for something. There are certainly places where people were budgeting something and they are seeing a little bit of sticker shock and they are happy to talk a little bit more. But the reality is, for most of these businesses, the capital expense of building a building is spread over the next 40 years or 60 years. If it's a good investment, a 10% or 15% increase in the total price is very unlikely to turn something into a bad investment. Especially if you think about it this is the second time in my career in this industry where we are facing a big very quick increase in material costs. The last time was 2005. The summer of 2005 there was an awakening where people said, China is here to stay and they are going to use a lot of the world's resources and building supplies doubled over about a six months period. We managed through that with just a, I mean, this was a $1 million I think of effect. But also the biggest reason I feel much, much better this time is, last time this big \"problem\" was a real problem because that was going to happen in a place I don't do work. Very hard as the CFO of a company that build things that to say, oh, this factor that's raising cost, that's driven by the fact that people really want to build things is a problem net net. I think at some point, you have to accept the fact that if you are going to be in a really robust market, you are going to move a little bit on the supply curve. So I don't know, I think it's good news.\nBrian Lane: And Adam, it's interesting. We have a very collaborative discussions throughout everybody on a project, customers, subs everybody else about the issue. So it's not like it's affecting a few sectors, right. It's broad based. So everybody is trying to work together to get these jobs built.\nBill George: And its self correcting. If people stop wanting buildings, what will happen to the material prices?\nAdam Thalhimer: Yes. We don't want that. Can you comment a little bit on pricing? I mean, it sounds like obviously good bookings in Q2. It sounds like the bidding is still steady. What are you seeing on pricing?\nBrian Lane: I think pricing is good. I mean, it's been pretty stable, new opportunities that we are looking at. So I think it will be okay.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then, Bill, can you repeat those Amteck numbers? And were those rest of year numbers?\nBill George: No. So we basically, in our press release, we said that once Amteck is a part of Comfort Systems, you could expect a $175 million to $200 million of revenue and $14 million to $17 million of EBITDA. And we did that with each one of our acquisitions, is just to get people an idea of what we bought. Obviously, we try to put numbers in that we think are very fair and achievable. But I will say also those are numbers that we expect them to average in years to come. There will be years when they do much better than that. And like all companies, if we have a company in Little Rock, Arkansas and nobody's building a building in Little Rock, Arkansas, the greatest company in the world might have a soft year too. So it is, we are a portfolio. But I never felt more comfortable with sort of my view of the prospects of some acquisitions that we have done.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great. Okay. Thanks guys.\nBill George: All right. Adam, take care.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thielman: Hi guys. Thanks. Hi Bill. Does the cash flow get better from here in the second half? I know you are going to have some working capital requirements, but I wonder --\nBill George: If I were guessing, we can do better than, we will probably do better than $20 million. The fourth quarter is usually a good cash flow quarter for us. But the one thing I would say is, if we were to go back to that eye-popping cash flow, it wouldn't necessarily be good news. It's actually, cash flow less than our earnings for the next three or four quarters if our revenues are going up the way we expect them to, because definitionally, in general, we pay people their wages before we, on a weighted average, get paid for the work we do. So it's good news, I think that. But the good news is, I think we have very good cash flow. I don't know if we can match the first half, but the second quarter was just a low number. There is one factor that's just out there that's math. And that is, last year they gave us permission not to pay our payroll taxes. And we aren't a simple workforce. We have a lot of payroll taxes. And we have to make up half of that in the fourth quarter of this year and we have to make up the other half of that in the fourth quarter of the next year. So that's definitionally going to knock, I think $20 million off or something in the fourth quarter as we just do a catch-up on that.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. And I think the electrical profitability over the last couple of quarters is a pretty interesting story. Your revenue is down a lot, but obviously much improved. I wanted to get your thoughts. I mean, can you build on these levels as you start to accelerate some of this new work? I am not asking about timing but just more whether this is kind of the baseline we ought to think about for that side of the business that you can build out as things get more active?\nBrian Lane: Yes. So hi Brent, this is Brian. Yes. There has been a marked improvement in the profitability of electrical. And as we announced early, when we got into electrical that we probably shrink it before we grew it again. But I am very optimistic about the possibilities of improving margins in electrical, particularly with Amteck joining us. We have got a good critical mass, sharing best practices, et cetera, using pre-fabrication. So I think for modeling sake, there's probably a good baseline, but I am optimistic we will get better.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. I appreciate it guys. Thank you.\nBrian Lane: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.\nJulio Romero: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.\nBrian Lane: Hi. Good morning.\nJulio Romero: So I guess, I wanted to start on the services side. You are seeing a nice rebound there sequentially. Is that rebound in service mirroring your increase in some of the sub-sectors, industrial, government or multifamily? Or is there other sub-sectors that may be driving that?\nBill George: No. Our sweet spot for service, unlike construction is commercial. So we do an awful lot of service in commercial buildings. We do a lot of projects across our portfolio. But where we get in there and do a lot of demand service, where we have a lot of our preventive maintenance agreements is in commercial. If you think about it, somebody like Duke University or the Methodist Hospital System, they have their own facilities management teams. And so they kind of call us when they plan to do something hard like a project. It's really in our commercial that we do a lot of service.\nJulio Romero: Got it. So I guess the implication would be, on the construction side and commercial that's something where the air pocket maybe affecting you?\nBill George: I don't know if you are asking if the air pocket has affected us in the second quarter in service. I think the answer is no. I think our service was up 12% or something.\nJulio Romero: No. I am sorry. Yes. I meant to say that because the commercial and other was down year-over-year on the revenue side. And if service is up, I guess the implication is that the construction side of commercial is down. Okay.\nBrian Lane: Yes. Absolutely. And it's really improved on the industrial and the others as we mentioned. But also on the service front, right, we have got some help with the excessive heat we are having too. So we have an HVAC business. And there's no question that that does help us. But we are full tilt in service right now.\nBill George: And by the way, I would also say commercial is not as strong, I would say in the United States today as industrial or even institutional. But our commercial numbers coming down is not just indicative of like weakness in commercial. It is indicative of decisions being made by our subsidiaries to take work that's more complex and better for them. It's indicative of us moving up the food chain really.\nJulio Romero: Got it. That's helpful. I guess if you can talk about the mix of what you are seeing in backlog now. I know you mentioned some improvement, particularly in industrial. But I am curious if education or any other sub-sectors might be increasing year-over-year, making a bigger portion of your backlog, but not at the current revenue mix?\nBrian Lane: Yes. I know if you look at our backlog today, industrial is very commensurate with our revenues. So that's strong and growing. We are hitting growth out of medical for sure, both in new build hospitals, retrofits and medical facilities and also a fair bit of what I call laboratory research facilities and vaccine development facilities. And education has been pretty stable for us, doing a little bit of work with air quality in schools, et cetera. But universities is still pretty strong for us, Julio. So of all other sectors in the backlog, that had a majority of it.\nJulio Romero: Understood.\nBill George: Yes. Believe it or not, lodging and entertainment also was up. We had a couple of nice bookings in that area this quarter.\nBrian Lane: Yes. We got some hotels going up, which is not what we expected.\nJulio Romero: Yes. I haven't seen that much on other companies either. I guess just last one for me here is, what do you think Tennessee Electrical does in the back half of the year from a revenue run rate standpoint?\nBill George: What did you say, Tennessee Electric, TEC?\nJulio Romero: Tennessee, correct, TEC.\nBill George: That's probably a little too granular. Their revenues were very light in the first half and we knew it. Like, three months before we did the deal, he was telling me that he had this period and they are picking up. They have got some jobs starting. So I think they will be up considerably, but it's hard for me to, I just don't have at my fingertips have a number I can put on that.\nBrian Lane: But I will tell you, I was at TEC there recently and their workload, they will be full tilt the back end of this year for sure.\nJulio Romero: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking the questions.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I will now turn the call back to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Well thanks, Charlie. In closing, I really want to once again thank our wonderful employees and I really want to give a shout out to our analysts this morning for their preparation. They had a lot of calls going on today. We know it. We really appreciate you joining in the call today and your questions as well. So we are also glad and hopeful to see everybody here in the near future in-person. We are looking forward to it. In the meantime, everybody, be safe and have a good upcoming weekend, a good rest of your summer. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Okay. Thank you Julie. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are happy to report an excellent second quarter. We earned $0.90 per share despite some revenue headwinds arising from pandemic-related delays in some areas and projects. Our sequential backlog increased by $180 million this quarter on a same-store basis and our year-over-year same-store backlog also increased by $200 million. And this is the first time since the pandemic declined that we have seen a same-store increase in our backlog from the prior year. These increases support our belief that direct pandemic effects are abating. Our free cash flow continues to be strong and yesterday we increased our dividend. Our essential workforce proved its mettle during the recent challenges and they continue to excel as circumstances improve. We are grateful for their strength and perseverance. We are optimistic about our prospects for the next several quarters. We recently announced that Amteck will be joining Comfort Systems USA and that acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter. Amteck provides electrical contracting solutions and services, including core electric and low-voltage systems as well as services for planned of maintenance, retrofit and emergency work. Amteck is headquartered in Kentucky and focuses on the Southeastern United States, including Kentucky, Tennessee and the Carolinas. Amteck brings experienced professionals and a fantastic reputation for electrical contracting and services in industrial markets such as food processing. Amteck will add world-class capabilities in complex projects, deep customer relationships, design-build confidence and opportunities for synergy. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes, but first I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? Okay. Thanks Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021. New bookings significantly exceeded backlog performed during the second quarter. Backlog at the end of the second quarter of 2021 was $1.84 billion. We believe that the business impacts relating to COVID-19 have now stabilized and as a result same-store backlog increased sequentially by 11% or $180 million. That is a strong increase, particularly for the second quarter. The increase is broad based with strength across our markets, most notably, in industrial projects. Although delays might modestly impact activity levels for the third quarter, we see strong underlying trends in the coming quarters and we are comfortable with the backlog we have across our operating locations. Our industrial activities were 42% of total revenue in the first half of 2021. We think this sector will continue growing as the majority of the revenues at our new companies of TAS and TEC are industrial and because industrial is heavily represented in new backlog. Institutional markets, which include education, healthcare and the government, are strong and were 33% of our revenue. The commercial sector is also solid but with our changing mix, it is now about 25% of our revenue. For the first six months of 2021, construction was 77% of our revenue with 46% from construction projects for new buildings and 31% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service was a great story this quarter and service revenue was 23% of year-to-date revenue with service projects providing 9% of revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 14% of revenue. Year-to-date service revenue is up approximately 12% with improved profitability. Service has now rebounded to full activity levels. Buildings are open. Profitable small project activity is back and we continue to help customers with their indoor air quality. Overall, service was a major source of profit for us this quarter and really helped to offset the temporary air pockets in construction. Our mechanical segment continues to perform well, despite being most impacted by the pandemic-related air pockets. Our electrical gross margins improved from 6.5% in the first six months of 2020 to 14.3% this year. Finally, our outlook. Our backlog grew this quarter and strength is returning. Project development and planning activities continue to be strong with our customers. We are confident in recent acquisitions and are excited about the pending addition of Amteck. We also continue to invest in our workforce and businesses in order to grow earnings and cash flow. For the balance of 2021, the pandemic recovery will continue to affect revenue timing and work and we also faced a tough third quarter comparison as Bill mentioned. As work picks up, we will be impacted by timing and we will invest some working capital in order to ramp up. For the next few quarters, we will have relatively fewer closeouts also. We are paying more for materials. But so far material availability and increases have been manageable. We are closely monitoring material shortages and costs and are taking steps to add additional protections on new work. All of these considerations make it hard to predict exactly how the next quarter or two will unfold. But the underlying trends and opportunities are very positive. Despite some moving pieces in carryover effects in the near term, we look forward to continued profitability and our increased backlog and strong pipeline indicate that we can expect stronger activity levels later this year and into 2022. We are optimistic about finishing 2021 on a strong note and we are even more optimistic about 2022. Thank you once again to our employees for your hard work and dedication. I will now turn it back over to Charlie for questions. Thank you. Good morning Sean. Yes. Well, I think, first of all, Sean we are seeing a lot of opportunity still throughout the country. It's work we like, work we are good at. So that gives me a lot of confidence that we will be able to execute well in the field. And as far as we can see, that's going to continue for the rest of this year into next year. There's multitude of opportunities. Particularly, if you look at the industrial sector, data centers, pharma, medical facilities, labs, food processing, medical in general on the retrofit side and some new buildings and education. So I am pretty confident what we are seeing and I think the momentum will continue. I guess your question about the materials and labor. I am sure it's well documented. But I think we are doing a really good job managing it on the material front, in particular. We have really good relationships with our vendors, a long history with them which we pay them fairly and we pay them on time. And we will let them know what's coming as early as we can and all of us are on the phone with them. So I mean, we are going to manage our way through. We have been through tight times before. None of us are new at this. And of course on the labor front, you do everything you can. I think stuff like pre-fabrication and modular helps us reduce our dependence a little bit on labor. But we recruit and bringing them in, training them. But I am pretty optimistic. We have got a lot of well-seasoned professionals out there doing the work and we will get through it. As far as your model goes, I don't know, but the most important things about those changes are, in the complex space you have a much better opportunity to get reliable margins and to charge for the labor that we have that's really what you invest in when you buy Comfort Systems stock is group of people who can do hard things. I am not sure it really changes the modeling. I do think that industrial will go up for the rest of this year, but almost certainly just because we will have a full year of two companies that are virtually 100% industrial. And as Amteck comes in, they have a richer industrial mix than we have on average. And they have particular expertise in things like food processing and certain types of industrial facilities that really we didn't have a lot of exposure to. And a really great sort of it shaped the geography where we are really excellent at this stuff, a little bit to the chasing our sweet spot of the greater Southeast but shades us a little more to the west of the Southeast in some areas that we think are just really, really attractive in the coming years. Yes. If you look at where we are at the year-to-date, we are over 18%, Sean. I mean, you look at the three month timeframe, I think we are really executing really well in the field. I think we will be back to our normal spot. I think this is just a one quarter decline in my opinion. Yes,. I couldn't be happier with the way we are performing in construction and service right now. All right. Thanks Sean. Good morning Adam. And Adam, it's interesting. We have a very collaborative discussions throughout everybody on a project, customers, subs everybody else about the issue. So it's not like it's affecting a few sectors, right. It's broad based. So everybody is trying to work together to get these jobs built. I think pricing is good. I mean, it's been pretty stable, new opportunities that we are looking at. So I think it will be okay. Yes. So hi Brent, this is Brian. Yes. There has been a marked improvement in the profitability of electrical. And as we announced early, when we got into electrical that we probably shrink it before we grew it again. But I am very optimistic about the possibilities of improving margins in electrical, particularly with Amteck joining us.

            "name": "Bill George",
            "content": "Thanks Brian. Before I review second quarter details, I want to discuss the impact of COVID and how that has affected the composition and timing of earnings and revenues so far this year and in the comparable period last year. Our first quarter results in 2020 were lowered by COVID. As we closed that quarter last year in the midst of governmental orders in building and job shutdowns, we were very concerned about how the pandemic and work precautions would affect our productivity. Accordingly, the judgments we made to close the first quarter last year led us to expect higher cost on jobs and reduced margins and we also reserved certain receivables. Three months later, by the time we were closing our second quarter, it had become clear that our activities were deemed essential and that we could work at good productivity levels or would be paid for lost productivity in most cases. As a result, we reassessed some cautious estimates and partially as a result of those judgments, the second quarter of 2020 was particularly robust. We continued to benefit from those factors in last year's second quarter as well and the third quarter of 2020 also benefited from a very discrete gain relating to the settlement of open issues with the IRS for our 2014 and 2015 tax years. As a result, although underlying trends are strengthening, we continue to face tough comparables in the third quarter. Now during the first half of this year and a year later, we have good execution and productivity. However, we have had some revenue softness due to delays in work preparation and pre-construction due to the pandemic. We are also towards the end of closing out some work that was performed under the worst conditions of the pandemic. And so the margins we achieved this quarter reflect a little of that headwind. Fortunately, those effects are subsiding and our research and backlog and active pipeline is a sign of good demand and prospects. And so with that background and context, let me review the numbers in more detail. Revenue for the 2021 second quarter was $714 million, a decrease of $30 million compared to last year and our same-store revenue declined by $46 million. Gross profit this quarter was $126 million, lower by $19 million. And gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined to 17.7% this quarter compared to 19.6% for the second quarter of 2020. Our gross profit this quarter reflected the headwinds that we are experiencing in construction, particularly in our mechanical segment. If you compare the six months period this year to the same period in 2020, gross profit was 18.1% for the first six months of 2021, which is roughly equivalent to 18.2% for the first half of 2020. SG&A expense for the quarter was $88 million or 12.3% of revenue, compared to $85 million or 11.4% of revenue for the same quarter in 2020. On a same-store basis, SG&A was similar to last year with a same-store increase of $1 million. Our 2021 tax rate was 23.8% compared to 27.6% in 2020. Our quarterly tax rate benefited from permanent differences related to stock-based compensation and we expect a more normal rate in the second half of the year. Net income for the second quarter of 2021 was $33 million or $0.90 per share. And that result included $0.10 of income related to the revaluation of our contingent earnout obligations. We have four large earnouts active in 2021. And so we expect more variability than usual in earnout valuations this year. Our net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $39 million or $1.08 per share. For our second quarter, EBITDA was $55 million and year-to-date we have $106 million of EBITDA. Free cash flow in the first six months was $101 million as compared to $151 million for the first half of 2020. The slowdown and some temporary tax benefits created unprecedented cash flow last year. Our cash flow is very strong through six months. But as activity levels improve, we are likely to continue deploying some working capital to start new projects in many of our geographies. Ongoing strong cash flow has allowed us to reduce our debt faster than expected and also to remain active in repurchasing our stock and we have reduced our outstanding share count for five consecutive years. Brian mentioned that we recently entered into an agreement to acquire Amteck and that transaction is expected to close shortly and during the third quarter. We have not yet closed Amteck, so no revenue or backlog is yet included. Amteck will be included in our electrical segment and it is expected to contribute annualized revenues of approximately $175 million to $200 million and EBITDA of $14 million to $17 million. In light of the required amortization expense related to intangibles and other costs associated with that transaction, the acquisition is expected to make a neutral to slightly accretive contribution to earnings per share for the first 12 months to 18 months. So that's all I have on financials, Brian. Yes. You think about it a year with all the craziness over the last year, right. One of the things that happened last year was people had to work out on job sites with masks on and they could flow fewer people in an elevator and just more distance and longer timeframe to just get on to the job site as you were getting your temperature taken. So even though a year ago, we found out we could still work with good productivity, that doesn't mean it doesn't affect somebody. If they have to wait 10 extra minutes to get in and we are paying them, that's 10 minutes of lost productivity. So I think that on many of our jobs, we had some lost productivity. It's just that we had money in our cost codes to cover it. But when you get to the end of the job, we are finishing a lot of those jobs, that's still going to affect how much of a pickup you are going to have at the end, right. And also, we are in a period of time when we have a little bit, we have some sporadic air pockets in places where they are about to get really busy. And as you might imagine, if you have got, well, there isn't pipe fitters and plumbers and master electricians, you are going to usually pretty slow to lay those guys off when you are facing a giant amount of work. So I think what you are seeing is an amazing outcome as our guys are managing through an inflection point a little bit and a little bit of an air pocket. And we are thrilled to make a ton of money and be positioned the way we are. So as far as we can tell, when you talk to virtually any of our companies, there's still a ton of planning going on, right. So I think, nobody likes it when they have to pay more for something. There are certainly places where people were budgeting something and they are seeing a little bit of sticker shock and they are happy to talk a little bit more. But the reality is, for most of these businesses, the capital expense of building a building is spread over the next 40 years or 60 years. If it's a good investment, a 10% or 15% increase in the total price is very unlikely to turn something into a bad investment. Especially if you think about it this is the second time in my career in this industry where we are facing a big very quick increase in material costs. The last time was 2005. The summer of 2005 there was an awakening where people said, China is here to stay and they are going to use a lot of the world's resources and building supplies doubled over about a six months period. We managed through that with just a, I mean, this was a $1 million I think of effect. But also the biggest reason I feel much, much better this time is, last time this big \"problem\" was a real problem because that was going to happen in a place I don't do work. Very hard as the CFO of a company that build things that to say, oh, this factor that's raising cost, that's driven by the fact that people really want to build things is a problem net net. I think at some point, you have to accept the fact that if you are going to be in a really robust market, you are going to move a little bit on the supply curve. So I don't know, I think it's good news. And its self correcting. If people stop wanting buildings, what will happen to the material prices? No. So we basically, in our press release, we said that once Amteck is a part of Comfort Systems, you could expect a $175 million to $200 million of revenue and $14 million to $17 million of EBITDA. And we did that with each one of our acquisitions, is just to get people an idea of what we bought. Obviously, we try to put numbers in that we think are very fair and achievable. But I will say also those are numbers that we expect them to average in years to come. There will be years when they do much better than that. And like all companies, if we have a company in Little Rock, Arkansas and nobody's building a building in Little Rock, Arkansas, the greatest company in the world might have a soft year too. So it is, we are a portfolio. But I never felt more comfortable with sort of my view of the prospects of some acquisitions that we have done. All right. Adam, take care. If I were guessing, we can do better than, we will probably do better than $20 million. The fourth quarter is usually a good cash flow quarter for us. But the one thing I would say is, if we were to go back to that eye-popping cash flow, it wouldn't necessarily be good news. It's actually, cash flow less than our earnings for the next three or four quarters if our revenues are going up the way we expect them to, because definitionally, in general, we pay people their wages before we, on a weighted average, get paid for the work we do. So it's good news, I think that. But the good news is, I think we have very good cash flow. I don't know if we can match the first half, but the second quarter was just a low number. There is one factor that's just out there that's math. And that is, last year they gave us permission not to pay our payroll taxes. And we aren't a simple workforce. We have a lot of payroll taxes. And we have to make up half of that in the fourth quarter of this year and we have to make up the other half of that in the fourth quarter of the next year. So that's definitionally going to knock, I think $20 million off or something in the fourth quarter as we just do a catch-up on that. No. Our sweet spot for service, unlike construction is commercial. So we do an awful lot of service in commercial buildings. We do a lot of projects across our portfolio. But where we get in there and do a lot of demand service, where we have a lot of our preventive maintenance agreements is in commercial. If you think about it, somebody like Duke University or the Methodist Hospital System, they have their own facilities management teams. And so they kind of call us when they plan to do something hard like a project. It's really in our commercial that we do a lot of service. I don't know if you are asking if the air pocket has affected us in the second quarter in service. I think the answer is no. I think our service was up 12% or something. And by the way, I would also say commercial is not as strong, I would say in the United States today as industrial or even institutional. But our commercial numbers coming down is not just indicative of like weakness in commercial. It is indicative of decisions being made by our subsidiaries to take work that's more complex and better for them. It's indicative of us moving up the food chain really. Yes. Believe it or not, lodging and entertainment also was up. We had a couple of nice bookings in that area this quarter. What did you say, Tennessee Electric, TEC? That's probably a little too granular. Their revenues were very light in the first half and we knew it. Like, three months before we did the deal, he was telling me that he had this period and they are picking up. They have got some jobs starting. So I think they will be up considerably, but it's hard for me to, I just don't have at my fingertips have a number I can put on that."

[Operator Instructions]. And with that, I'd like to hand over to Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Julie, please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Matt. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's first quarter earnings call. Our comments this morning as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Act of 1995. What we will say today is based on the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause these actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release covering these earnings.  A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com.  Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer.  Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today.  We are pleased to report a strong start to 2021. Earnings improved substantially with earnings per share of $0.73 compared to $0.48 in the pandemic-impacted first quarter of last year. This quarter, we achieved unprecedented first quarter cash generation, thanks to strong execution as well as the receipt of large advanced payments, served orders and projects. Our backlog has also strengthened sequentially, and we see good trends in underlying activity levels, especially in our industrial, technology and modular markets. Overall, we are optimistic about our prospects for the next several quarters.  I will discuss our business and outlook in more detail in a few minutes. But first, let me turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nWilliam George: Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. As Brian said, our results were again very strong. First quarter revenue was $670 million, a decrease of $30 million compared to the same quarter last year. Our same-store revenue declined by $83 million. However, our recent acquisitions added approximately $53 million in revenue this quarter. You may recall that last year, we had large data center work ongoing in Texas, and that created high revenue in the comparable period. We will continue to face a tough revenue comparison in the second quarter of 2021, but to a lesser extent than this quarter.  Gross profit was $123 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $6 million, and gross profit as a percentage of revenue rose to 18.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 16.7% for the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in gross margin results from stronger margins in electrical.  SG&A expense was $88 million or 13.2% of revenue for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $93 million or 13.3% of revenue for the first quarter of 2020. On a same-store basis, SG&A declined by $6 million -- $11 million. That decrease included a $6 million reduction in bad debt expense as last year's collectibility concerns for retail and other customers are trending better than we've predicted. The remainder of the decline in SG&A was the result of cost discipline.  Our 2021 tax rate was 24.8% compared to 27.6% in 2020. Our current year tax rate benefited from permanent differences related to stock-based compensation, and we expect it to trend upwards into our normal range for the full year.  Overall net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $26 million or $0.73 per share as compared to $18 million or $0.48 per share in 2020. For our first quarter, EBITDA was $51 million, a 39% improvement over last year, and our trailing 12-month EBITDA is a record $264 million.  Free cash flow in the first quarter was $80 million as compared to $15 million in Q1 2020. This year's -- this quarter's free cash flow is far higher than we've ever achieved in the first quarter, as we received advanced payments on large projects that are commencing and our lower same-store revenue led to some temporary harvesting of working capital. As we execute these projects over the next few quarters, and if organic revenue improved in the second half as expected, we will see some absorption of working capital.  Our free cash flow over the trailing 12-month period is $330 million, and that strong performance has returned our leverage to well under 1x EBITDA despite our many ongoing and recent acquisitions.  That's all I have, Brian, for financials.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for the remainder of 2021.  Backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2021 was $1.66 billion. We believe that the effects of the pandemic are beginning to subside as same-store backlog increased sequentially by nearly $150 million or 10%. Although we expect some delays in bookings will continue through the second quarter, we remain optimistic about trends for the second half of the year. Overall, we are very comfortable with the backlog we have across our operating locations.  We are seeing good trends in the underlying activity levels, especially in our industrial, technology and modular markets. Our industrial revenue was 40% of total revenue in the first quarter. We expect this sector to continue to grow as the majority of the revenues at our newer companies of TAS and TEC are industrial. And industrial is heavily represented in new backlog.  Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government were 35% of our revenue, and that is roughly consistent with what we saw in 2020. The commercial sector is now about 25% of our revenue.  For the first quarter of 2021, we construction was 77% of our revenue, with 45% from construction projects for new buildings and 32% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service was 23% of our first quarter 2021 revenue, with service projects providing 9% of revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 14% of revenue. Year-over-year service revenue is up approximately 4% with improved profitability.  We are seeing good opportunities in indoor air quality, which has helped many of our service departments return to prepandemic volumes. The high new interest in IAQ plays to our strength of solving problems for our customers, and air quality considerations help us differentiate ourselves in both service and construction. Our mechanical segment continues to perform extremely well. Our electrical gross margins improved from 5.5% in the first quarter of 2020 to 14.7% this year.  Finally, our outlook. Our backlog strengthened this quarter and the effects of the pandemic are fading. We expect some continued organic revenue declines in the second quarter of 2021, but less than we experienced in the current quarter. We continue to see strong project development and planning activities among our customers, especially in technology and other industrial verticals. Our large operations are in places where companies continue to invest, such as Texas, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia. It was 1 year ago that we reported our first quarter at a time when everyone was adjusting to the risk and uncertainty of the pandemic. Looking back at our success over the last year, I am more grateful than ever for how our people overcame unprecedented challenges and for their undaunted courage and perseverance on customer sites across our nation. I really thank them. We will continue to work hard to keep our workforce and our community healthy and safe.  We look forward to continued strong profitability and good cash flow in 2021, and our strong pipeline makes us optimistic about activity levels in the second half of this year and into 2022. We will continue to invest in our workforce and to improve our formidable mechanical and electrical businesses in existing and new geographies. Thank you once again to all our employees for their hard work and dedication.  I will now turn it back over to Matt for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question is coming from Adam Thalhimer.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great quarter.\nBrian Lane: Adam, thanks a lot.\nAdam Thalhimer: Bill, how do you see SG&A trending this year?\nWilliam George: So I think that there is -- if there's a slight upward pressure, it will be because travel starts to resume and we begin to do more -- we continued our training, but it was online. We'll get back to some more in-person training.  But in general, I'm really, really happy with our SG&A. If you have told me we'd have this kind of same-store revenue decline and have -- still get SG&A leverage, I would have been -- I am thrilled. And I actually think we've got good control on our SG&A. Now, we'll stay in that 13%, a little above that level most likely, until revenue starts to pick up later in the year. But yes, no, I -- we feel great about that.\nBrian Lane: And just to add on to that, Adam, it just goes to show the great job that the operating companies do, do in monitoring the overhead and not bringing it back until we really need it. So they've done a terrific job.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then I kind of hate when people ask companies this question because what are you going to say? But on acquisitions, you guys have done such great job. And you usually don't do big acquisitions during the construction season. So is the best chance for something kind of next winter? What are you seeing out there, I guess, is the question?\nWilliam George: So here's what we're seeing. We're seeing really good activity, people who really value what it would mean to be a part of Comfort Systems, the fact that their company is not put up for sale the day after they sell it and that we are going to bring their balance sheet into our balance sheet and make them a part of us and that we're a forever buyer. So that's very attractive to people.  At the same time, there are some corners of the market without -- if you're willing to let your company be levered up and endangered, they'll -- you can get really, really good sort of sticker pricing. The structure might not be -- might have some drawbacks, but the sticker that they'll give -- the pricing that they'll give you is pretty high. So to boil that down, I really like our chance of buying some of the kind of companies that really fit with us, that value the same things that we value.  And as far as the timing for that, we do tend to do our standalones in the winter, and -- but sometimes they happen in the summer. You have to take them when they're ready to sell. And what -- the biggest variable right now is what people think is happening with tax rates, right? So a lot of that may be dependent on whether they backdate the date. They have good -- when we buy companies, they're usually people we've been talking to for a long time, right? We don't try to work somebody into a frenzy. We buy them when it makes sense for them and for us because it's a long game.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then just a quick one on kind of how you guys see EPS shaken out this year. Because there was some language last quarter about not matching a very strong 2020, and that was removed.\nWilliam George: Yes. So this is a hard year to comment on because there were a lot of moving pieces last year, right? So we had the first quarter where, really, we were very conservative when we closed our books because we thought, \"Oh, productivity is about to be destroyed by COVID considerations.\" So we had a very easy comparable in the first quarter.  By the end of the second quarter, it was clear that the productivity loss was less than we had feared, and we have room in a lot of our guaranteed maximum jobs. So we had a really strong -- we earned $1.08 last year in the second quarter. That's a tough comparable, if you're being honest.  And then in the second half, how you would view that would depend on -- we had 2 discrete items, one in each of the last 2 quarters. Everybody knows that. They're in last year's press releases there. You can dig them up all over the place. But we got $0.17 in the third quarter of last year when we settled an R&D tax audit from the 2014 and 2015 calendar years. So that was $0.17. That's just really, really discrete. And then the fourth quarter, in part, because COVID had affected the results of some of our bigger and recent acquisitions, we had pickups from our earn-outs where -- when it became clear we might not be paying out quite as much as we had expected, and that was $0.18.  So I know the analysts took those off. We think we have a good chance of being in the range of sort of those -- the numbers we earned last year, not counting those extraordinary, in some cases -- in one case, noncash item. But obviously, really tough comparables this year if you add in those extraordinary pickups. Is that clear? I know that's a lot.\nAdam Thalhimer: Well, it sounds like a tweak better than before. You're not telling us to go nuts, but it's not firmly down the way we might have thought a couple of months ago.\nWilliam George: So it turns out we'd have to go put in some pipes, yes.\nBrian Lane: No, but in general, we are optimistic about the year, Adam.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Brent Thielman.\nBrent Thielman: Brian, the industrial bucket as a percentage of the revenue pie is as large as I can remember. Love to just get some flavor of what the bigger drivers of that are in terms of the market that sort of make up that bucket?\nBrian Lane: Yes. I'll go first, and I'll see Bill wants to follow-on. But yes, it's the biggest we've ever had it. We've talked a lot about the recent acquisitions, heavy industrial focus. Obviously, data centers right now in technology is a big component of that today. But also including that, we're seeing a lot of good pharma and food processing opportunities as well, Brent. So I think those would be the 3 largest areas that we're looking at the moment.  Bill, anything else that you want to add?\nWilliam George: Yes. Our strength in the Mid-Atlantic and in the Southeast is very geographically tied with where people are -- companies are investing that money. And they also -- there's another little just structural issue, which is we bought this great company, TEC, in Tennessee at December 31 of last year. That company is 100% industrial. It's a company in the roughly $100 million revenue range. So the full year of those guys will bring in -- will just that's going to add industrial just as they age in, as they storm their way into those numbers.\nBrian Lane: And Brent, in terms of that sector going forward, we're still seeing plenty of opportunities. And as I mentioned in the script, it's got a lot of legs to it in the industrial sector going forward.\nWilliam George: Commercial is a section that's been shrinking for us, right? But I just want to mention, on an absolute basis, it stayed pretty constant for us. It's just that the other sectors have gotten bigger. I will also say a lot of commercial, especially office building, is built by developers. And they're very sensitive to first cost, right? Like we'll build office space for pharma companies, but it's incorporated into something that has mixed use.  But true office building is often built by developers. And they will frequently -- they may not plan to own the asset after they build it, after they develop it. They will frequently really be bid-oriented. And a lot of our guys would much rather negotiate work right now. So there's some natural structural things that are making commercial be a little bit better fit for our competitors maybe than for us.\nBrian Lane: But on that front, we're still seeing a lot of good service opportunities, and we'll have some IAQ opportunities on the commercial office building.\nWilliam George: Right? Commercial service is great. If you think -- that's the majority of our service business. It's a good place for us.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. That's helpful. Yes. I guess just thinking about some of the hesitation in the market among your customers seems to be abating, from what I take from your comment here. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about what -- where are you seeing continued delays and what are the reasons behind that? Is it access to contractors like yourselves? Is it just the economy? What are you kind of hearing from customers there?\nWilliam George: So I wouldn't really call it hesitation. When I talked to our guys, it was more the case that it just wasn't a good time to start stuff, right? In the middle of COVID, you have to go get soil, plans and county approvals and lots of offices were closed. So I would not say it was hesitation in the sense that -- in general, our customers, the kind of customers we're talking about we're all -- wanted to build stuff. And I think it was just more functionally -- some air pockets were created by that. And I would say it's just a matter of this work getting started sort of in an orderly manner. It's not...\nBrian Lane: Yes. Brent, the pace has picked up in terms of what we're looking at, in terms of stuff we're reviewing here, decisions being made quicker. So you can see -- at least I can feel a significant change in pace.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. And then I guess a question on the electrical segment. I mean, margins has snapped back to -- well, to the levels that you guys have talked about before a lot faster than I thought. And I'm curious, what portion of that comes from the kind of refocus initiatives you've done internally versus some of the acquisitions you've done. And then how we got think about the margins going forward for that segment because it's a big change from last year.\nBrian Lane: Yes, yes. So I'll go first and then Bill can comment. But thanks for the question there. First of all, about Walker, which we've talked about over a year now. Walker has always been a really -- an elite electrical contractor in this state of Texas. That has not changed. Their work is tremendous. I just think, over time, they probably refocused themselves on the customer base that they were pursuing and stopped certain sectors add on that. Hopefully, we've been able to help them, a little bit of training some technology, et cetera.  But at the end of the day, it comes down to the folks in the field doing the work. They've always done really good work. Probably just a touch of refocusing. They've always been a great company. So I'm really happy for them, that all the work they put in over the last year really did start to come to a fruition for them in the first quarter. And Bill, you want to talk about this one?\nWilliam George: Just that one specific question you said about how much of the improvement came from. So TEC is 100% in our electrical segment. Actually, TEC stands for Tennessee Electrical Contractors, and they are -- they have the oldest license to do electrical work in the state of Tennessee. And -- but they do all -- they do a mix of really, really complex industrial service and projects nowadays. They -- believe it or not, their margins were within 100 basis points of Walker's margins. So they're the two main parts of our electrical. And Walker's margins are fully back into the same range as TEC reported this quarter. So it wasn't a mix this year.\nBrian Lane: But we are glad to see it.\nBrent Thielman: Sure. Well, congrats on a great quarter and best of luck here going forward.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next one is coming from Julio Romero.\nJulio Romero: How do you think your service business progresses throughout the year? Should the growth rate outpace new construction? Or maybe how much of the overall revenue mix does service make up in '21?\nBrian Lane: Service has been hovering around 20% to 25%. I think you'll see it outpace construction. We continue to grow it. It's very methodical. We will continue to invest in it, both in hiring people and training. We're seeing some good opportunities come out of indoor air quality front in terms of volume. And I think that will continue to be a great, steady growth and cash flow opportunity for us over a long period of time.\nWilliam George: Yes. You know what's interesting about service is that they -- service has -- even though service has been shrinking as a percentage of revenue, it's never gone down. It's got nothing but growth for us. And it's twice as big as it was just a few years ago, but it's 3 or 4x as profitable, which is what we really care about. And at the end of the day, it's got really a good prospect.  If you think about it, it's had more organic growth than construction, right? Construction, a lot of that growth has come from acquisitions, although we've grown in construction. Especially in industrial, we've really developed a new sort of level of capability. But service has done great overall. It's just that our acquisitions have been a lot of industrial project companies and things like that.\nBrian Lane: But we have a big focus on it, continue to grow it, and we will keep the pedal to the metal on service.\nJulio Romero: Got it. And on the IAQ opportunity, I think -- I'm not sure if someone asked about education earlier. But I understand that IAQ is driving more school work activity, but I did see the revenue in education declined in the quarter. So I don't know if you can help us kind of square those two things.\nBrian Lane: Yes. I think we're in the early days of reallocation of the funds to school. We've done a lot of work, researching very specifically where the money is going. We have a lot of very good relationships with school systems. So I think you'll see that continue to grow here as people get a better understanding and schools have a better understanding of what they actually want to do. But we can do anything they need us to do. And I anticipate that will be picking up, I think, pretty soon now that they've allocated the money to it.\nWilliam George: By the way, a little structural factor. If you're comparing the first quarter to the full year, ton of school work happens in the summer.\nBrian Lane: Yes.\nWilliam George: So you're -- so that's not -- that wouldn't be surprising.\nJulio Romero: Yes. That makes a lot of sense. So I mean, I guess, quotation is going off in education and kind of overall activity levels, as you see it. And it's just a matter of those funds being allocated and just kind of translating to revenue over time.\nBrian Lane: Yes. They're sharing what they want to do.\nJulio Romero: Right. Okay. And I guess just the last question for me is -- it's a minor one, but there was a mention of a Utah acquisition within the quarter in the Q. So I don't know if you could talk about that acquisition and how it fits within the broader mechanical segment.\nWilliam George: Yes. So that was a plumbing company. Fantastic little company with unbelievable relationships. And it was just an addition to our already very attractive business in Utah. We wanted to get stronger in Utah, and we have never regretted buying a truly good plumbing company.\nBrian Lane: That's for sure.\nWilliam George: And so they -- and it's really along the lines of we love fantastic people and workforces. But I think the range -- the size of that was $20 million or $30 million of revenue, so just not something we'd break out.\nBrian Lane: Happy to have them, though.\nOperator: And the next one is coming from Sean Eastman.\nSean Eastman: I guess just continuing on the discussion around the funky comparables on earnings. Maybe we can have the same discussion just on same-store growth. Anything you can point out on the cadence of same-store growth trends as we move through the balance of the year?\nWilliam George: Yes. So I'm glad you asked, actually. So same-store, we were down 11.8% first quarter 2021 over first quarter 2020. A big part of that was very, very heavy data center, like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people on some data center jobs in the fourth and first quarter of last year. So although we will face same-store revenue headwind in the second quarter, we'll not be near the last -- if there was, let's say, a 12% in the first quarter, we'll be low to mid-single digits most likely, best guess, in the second quarter. And then for the rest of the year, we think we have manageable revenue comparables.  Having said that, I would say, work is starting. And that can -- a month's delay. It is -- one of the reasons we are positive about 2022, which is not like us this early in the year, is we have so much work starting in the second half of this year, but of course, it has to go into 2022. But there is -- like some of that timing could matter a little bit, right? So having said that, they're fair comparables in the second half of the year. I have hard time telling you we'd be up much, but we shouldn't be down.\nBrian Lane: Yes. I agree.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That's helpful. And there's just a lot of discussion across the kind of industrial world these days about supply chain disruption, cost inflation. I mean, are those elements you guys are monitoring? Anything to point out in terms of what we should kind of kind of track as it relates to flow through to fix?\nBrian Lane: Yes. It's a good question. Obviously, we monitor it. We have long-term great relationships with all our vendors. We work closely with them. We'll continue to do so. It's really up and down depending on where it is. So far, equipment has all been good, no problems. Steel and copper, you've probably heard it, I'm sure, 20 times now, pricing up but there is availability. But nothing that's really impacting us at the moment. We're functioning, our job sites are going and nothing has been delayed so far. So we'll continue to monitor it, but it's healthier. But thank God, we have the relationships that we do have.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. There are no further questions. So I'd like to turn it back to Brian for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay, Matt. In closing, I want to once again thank all our wonderful employees and everyone for joining us on the call this morning. We're looking forward to seeing you again, of course, and soon, hopefully. But in the meanwhile, please stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much. Have a good rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Brian. Thank you, everyone. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the call for today. You may now disconnect. Thank you for joining, and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Our large operations are in places where companies continue to invest, such as Texas, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia. It was 1 year ago that we reported our first quarter at a time when everyone was adjusting to the risk and uncertainty of the pandemic. Looking back at our success over the last year, I am more grateful than ever for how our people overcame unprecedented challenges and for their undaunted courage and perseverance on customer sites across our nation. I really thank them. We will continue to work hard to keep our workforce and our community healthy and safe.  We look forward to continued strong profitability and good cash flow in 2021, and our strong pipeline makes us optimistic about activity levels in the second half of this year and into 2022. We will continue to invest in our workforce and to improve our formidable mechanical and electrical businesses in existing and new geographies. Thank you once again to all our employees for their hard work and dedication.  I will now turn it back over to Matt for questions. Thank you. Adam, thanks a lot. And just to add on to that, Adam, it just goes to show the great job that the operating companies do, do in monitoring the overhead and not bringing it back until we really need it. So they've done a terrific job. No, but in general, we are optimistic about the year, Adam. Yes. I'll go first, and I'll see Bill wants to follow-on. But yes, it's the biggest we've ever had it. We've talked a lot about the recent acquisitions, heavy industrial focus. Obviously, data centers right now in technology is a big component of that today. But also including that, we're seeing a lot of good pharma and food processing opportunities as well, Brent. So I think those would be the 3 largest areas that we're looking at the moment.  Bill, anything else that you want to add? And Brent, in terms of that sector going forward, we're still seeing plenty of opportunities. And as I mentioned in the script, it's got a lot of legs to it in the industrial sector going forward. But on that front, we're still seeing a lot of good service opportunities, and we'll have some IAQ opportunities on the commercial office building. Yes. Brent, the pace has picked up in terms of what we're looking at, in terms of stuff we're reviewing here, decisions being made quicker. So you can see -- at least I can feel a significant change in pace. Yes, yes. So I'll go first and then Bill can comment. But thanks for the question there. First of all, about Walker, which we've talked about over a year now. Walker has always been a really -- an elite electrical contractor in this state of Texas. That has not changed. Their work is tremendous. I just think, over time, they probably refocused themselves on the customer base that they were pursuing and stopped certain sectors add on that. Hopefully, we've been able to help them, a little bit of training some technology, et cetera.  But at the end of the day, it comes down to the folks in the field doing the work. They've always done really good work. Probably just a touch of refocusing. They've always been a great company. So I'm really happy for them, that all the work they put in over the last year really did start to come to a fruition for them in the first quarter. And Bill, you want to talk about this one? But we are glad to see it. All right. Thank you. Service has been hovering around 20% to 25%. I think you'll see it outpace construction. We continue to grow it. It's very methodical. We will continue to invest in it, both in hiring people and training. We're seeing some good opportunities come out of indoor air quality front in terms of volume. And I think that will continue to be a great, steady growth and cash flow opportunity for us over a long period of time. But we have a big focus on it, continue to grow it, and we will keep the pedal to the metal on service. Yes. I think we're in the early days of reallocation of the funds to school. We've done a lot of work, researching very specifically where the money is going. We have a lot of very good relationships with school systems. So I think you'll see that continue to grow here as people get a better understanding and schools have a better understanding of what they actually want to do. But we can do anything they need us to do. And I anticipate that will be picking up, I think, pretty soon now that they've allocated the money to it. Yes. Yes. They're sharing what they want to do. That's for sure. Happy to have them, though. Yes. I agree. Yes. It's a good question. Obviously, we monitor it. We have long-term great relationships with all our vendors. We work closely with them. We'll continue to do so. It's really up and down depending on where it is. So far, equipment has all been good, no problems. Steel and copper, you've probably heard it, I'm sure, 20 times now, pricing up but there is availability. But nothing that's really impacting us at the moment. We're functioning, our job sites are going and nothing has been delayed so far. So we'll continue to monitor it, but it's healthier. But thank God, we have the relationships that we do have. Okay, Matt. In closing, I want to once again thank all our wonderful employees and everyone for joining us on the call this morning. We're looking forward to seeing you again, of course, and soon, hopefully. But in the meanwhile, please stay safe and healthy. Thank you very much. Have a good rest of your day."

            "name": "William George",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. As Brian said, our results were again very strong. First quarter revenue was $670 million, a decrease of $30 million compared to the same quarter last year. Our same-store revenue declined by $83 million. However, our recent acquisitions added approximately $53 million in revenue this quarter. You may recall that last year, we had large data center work ongoing in Texas, and that created high revenue in the comparable period. We will continue to face a tough revenue comparison in the second quarter of 2021, but to a lesser extent than this quarter.  Gross profit was $123 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $6 million, and gross profit as a percentage of revenue rose to 18.4% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to 16.7% for the first quarter of 2020. The improvement in gross margin results from stronger margins in electrical.  SG&A expense was $88 million or 13.2% of revenue for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $93 million or 13.3% of revenue for the first quarter of 2020. On a same-store basis, SG&A declined by $6 million -- $11 million. That decrease included a $6 million reduction in bad debt expense as last year's collectibility concerns for retail and other customers are trending better than we've predicted. The remainder of the decline in SG&A was the result of cost discipline.  Our 2021 tax rate was 24.8% compared to 27.6% in 2020. Our current year tax rate benefited from permanent differences related to stock-based compensation, and we expect it to trend upwards into our normal range for the full year.  Overall net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $26 million or $0.73 per share as compared to $18 million or $0.48 per share in 2020. For our first quarter, EBITDA was $51 million, a 39% improvement over last year, and our trailing 12-month EBITDA is a record $264 million.  Free cash flow in the first quarter was $80 million as compared to $15 million in Q1 2020. This year's -- this quarter's free cash flow is far higher than we've ever achieved in the first quarter, as we received advanced payments on large projects that are commencing and our lower same-store revenue led to some temporary harvesting of working capital. As we execute these projects over the next few quarters, and if organic revenue improved in the second half as expected, we will see some absorption of working capital.  Our free cash flow over the trailing 12-month period is $330 million, and that strong performance has returned our leverage to well under 1x EBITDA despite our many ongoing and recent acquisitions.  That's all I have, Brian, for financials. So I think that there is -- if there's a slight upward pressure, it will be because travel starts to resume and we begin to do more -- we continued our training, but it was online. We'll get back to some more in-person training.  But in general, I'm really, really happy with our SG&A. If you have told me we'd have this kind of same-store revenue decline and have -- still get SG&A leverage, I would have been -- I am thrilled. And I actually think we've got good control on our SG&A. Now, we'll stay in that 13%, a little above that level most likely, until revenue starts to pick up later in the year. But yes, no, I -- we feel great about that. So here's what we're seeing. We're seeing really good activity, people who really value what it would mean to be a part of Comfort Systems, the fact that their company is not put up for sale the day after they sell it and that we are going to bring their balance sheet into our balance sheet and make them a part of us and that we're a forever buyer. So that's very attractive to people.  At the same time, there are some corners of the market without -- if you're willing to let your company be levered up and endangered, they'll -- you can get really, really good sort of sticker pricing. The structure might not be -- might have some drawbacks, but the sticker that they'll give -- the pricing that they'll give you is pretty high. So to boil that down, I really like our chance of buying some of the kind of companies that really fit with us, that value the same things that we value.  And as far as the timing for that, we do tend to do our standalones in the winter, and -- but sometimes they happen in the summer. You have to take them when they're ready to sell. And what -- the biggest variable right now is what people think is happening with tax rates, right? So a lot of that may be dependent on whether they backdate the date. They have good -- when we buy companies, they're usually people we've been talking to for a long time, right? We don't try to work somebody into a frenzy. We buy them when it makes sense for them and for us because it's a long game. Yes. So this is a hard year to comment on because there were a lot of moving pieces last year, right? So we had the first quarter where, really, we were very conservative when we closed our books because we thought, \"Oh, productivity is about to be destroyed by COVID considerations.\" So we had a very easy comparable in the first quarter.  By the end of the second quarter, it was clear that the productivity loss was less than we had feared, and we have room in a lot of our guaranteed maximum jobs. So we had a really strong -- we earned $1.08 last year in the second quarter. That's a tough comparable, if you're being honest.  And then in the second half, how you would view that would depend on -- we had 2 discrete items, one in each of the last 2 quarters. Everybody knows that. They're in last year's press releases there. You can dig them up all over the place. But we got $0.17 in the third quarter of last year when we settled an R&D tax audit from the 2014 and 2015 calendar years. So that was $0.17. That's just really, really discrete. And then the fourth quarter, in part, because COVID had affected the results of some of our bigger and recent acquisitions, we had pickups from our earn-outs where -- when it became clear we might not be paying out quite as much as we had expected, and that was $0.18.  So I know the analysts took those off. We think we have a good chance of being in the range of sort of those -- the numbers we earned last year, not counting those extraordinary, in some cases -- in one case, noncash item. But obviously, really tough comparables this year if you add in those extraordinary pickups. Is that clear? I know that's a lot. So it turns out we'd have to go put in some pipes, yes. Yes. Our strength in the Mid-Atlantic and in the Southeast is very geographically tied with where people are -- companies are investing that money. And they also -- there's another little just structural issue, which is we bought this great company, TEC, in Tennessee at December 31 of last year. That company is 100% industrial. It's a company in the roughly $100 million revenue range. So the full year of those guys will bring in -- will just that's going to add industrial just as they age in, as they storm their way into those numbers. Commercial is a section that's been shrinking for us, right? But I just want to mention, on an absolute basis, it stayed pretty constant for us. It's just that the other sectors have gotten bigger. I will also say a lot of commercial, especially office building, is built by developers. And they're very sensitive to first cost, right? Like we'll build office space for pharma companies, but it's incorporated into something that has mixed use.  But true office building is often built by developers. And they will frequently -- they may not plan to own the asset after they build it, after they develop it. They will frequently really be bid-oriented. And a lot of our guys would much rather negotiate work right now. So there's some natural structural things that are making commercial be a little bit better fit for our competitors maybe than for us. Right? Commercial service is great. If you think -- that's the majority of our service business. It's a good place for us. So I wouldn't really call it hesitation. When I talked to our guys, it was more the case that it just wasn't a good time to start stuff, right? In the middle of COVID, you have to go get soil, plans and county approvals and lots of offices were closed. So I would not say it was hesitation in the sense that -- in general, our customers, the kind of customers we're talking about we're all -- wanted to build stuff. And I think it was just more functionally -- some air pockets were created by that. And I would say it's just a matter of this work getting started sort of in an orderly manner. It's not... Just that one specific question you said about how much of the improvement came from. So TEC is 100% in our electrical segment. Actually, TEC stands for Tennessee Electrical Contractors, and they are -- they have the oldest license to do electrical work in the state of Tennessee. And -- but they do all -- they do a mix of really, really complex industrial service and projects nowadays. They -- believe it or not, their margins were within 100 basis points of Walker's margins. So they're the two main parts of our electrical. And Walker's margins are fully back into the same range as TEC reported this quarter. So it wasn't a mix this year. Yes. You know what's interesting about service is that they -- service has -- even though service has been shrinking as a percentage of revenue, it's never gone down. It's got nothing but growth for us. And it's twice as big as it was just a few years ago, but it's 3 or 4x as profitable, which is what we really care about. And at the end of the day, it's got really a good prospect.  If you think about it, it's had more organic growth than construction, right? Construction, a lot of that growth has come from acquisitions, although we've grown in construction. Especially in industrial, we've really developed a new sort of level of capability. But service has done great overall. It's just that our acquisitions have been a lot of industrial project companies and things like that. By the way, a little structural factor. If you're comparing the first quarter to the full year, ton of school work happens in the summer. So you're -- so that's not -- that wouldn't be surprising. Yes. So that was a plumbing company. Fantastic little company with unbelievable relationships. And it was just an addition to our already very attractive business in Utah. We wanted to get stronger in Utah, and we have never regretted buying a truly good plumbing company. And so they -- and it's really along the lines of we love fantastic people and workforces. But I think the range -- the size of that was $20 million or $30 million of revenue, so just not something we'd break out. Yes. So I'm glad you asked, actually. So same-store, we were down 11.8% first quarter 2021 over first quarter 2020. A big part of that was very, very heavy data center, like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people on some data center jobs in the fourth and first quarter of last year. So although we will face same-store revenue headwind in the second quarter, we'll not be near the last -- if there was, let's say, a 12% in the first quarter, we'll be low to mid-single digits most likely, best guess, in the second quarter. And then for the rest of the year, we think we have manageable revenue comparables.  Having said that, I would say, work is starting. And that can -- a month's delay. It is -- one of the reasons we are positive about 2022, which is not like us this early in the year, is we have so much work starting in the second half of this year, but of course, it has to go into 2022. But there is -- like some of that timing could matter a little bit, right? So having said that, they're fair comparables in the second half of the year. I have hard time telling you we'd be up much, but we shouldn't be down."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Justin. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Our comments today as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws and regulation. What we will say today is based upon the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to report a great finish to 2022 with increased revenue, record earnings, fantastic cash flow and a surge of backlog. Our teams delivered amazing execution, and we are grateful for their hard work. For the fourth quarter, we earned $1.54 per share on revenue of $1.1 billion. Full year revenue surpassed $4 billion and included same-store revenue growth of 22%. Backlog received an especially strong lift this quarter and our modular off-site construction operations as large customer purchases were committed in advance to support our ability to invest in modular construction capacity. Our backlog is now over $4 billion, a same-store increase of 75% from a year ago. Cash flow was also extraordinary in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, our cash flow exceeded our excellent earnings by a substantial amount. We are excited to announce that on February 1, we acquired Eldeco, a premier industrial electrical based in South Carolina. Eldeco will further strengthen our Electrical segment. And thanks to its capabilities and relationships in a perfectly located market for us, we believe that this combination will allow us to achieve important synergies over the coming years. We also declared a larger-than-normal increase in our dividend of $0.025 per share, which increases our quarterly payout to $0.175 per share. This increase reflects our continuing strong cash flow and our desire to reward our shareholders. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes. But first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George: Thanks, Brian. So revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1.1 billion, an increase of $261 million or 30% compared to last year. Same-store revenue increased by $200 million or 23%, with the remaining $61 million increase resulting from our acquisitions. Revenue for the full year 2022 increased by more than 35% compared to 2021 to $4.1 billion. Our full year Mechanical Services segment revenue increased $636 million or 25%, and our Electrical Services segment increased by 81% to $431 million. Same-store revenue increased by 22% or $669 million in 2022, a broad-based increase driven by strong ongoing market conditions. Inflation of equipment and materials also contributed to revenue growth. With respect to revenue prospects for 2023, our growth is hard to predict because of unknown inflation developments and potential variability and the timing and revenue contribution of new bookings. However, we currently estimate 2023 same-store revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens for the full year with larger percentage increases likely to occur earlier in the year considering prior comparables. Gross profit was $211 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, a $57 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage was 18.9% this quarter compared to 18.0% for the fourth quarter of 2021. Quarterly gross profit percentage in our Mechanical segment increased to 19.1%, while margins in the Electrical segment rose significantly to 18.2% this year from 14.8% in 2021. For the full year 2022, gross profit increased by $178 million, and our gross profit margin was 17.9% in 2022 as compared to 18.3% in 2021. Our full year gross profit margin held up remarkably well considering the spike in revenue, the relative increase in construction and the changes in our cost mix as higher prices meant the materials increased as a proportion of our cost and revenues. It is currently challenging to predict how our margins will unfold in 2023. Important factors that will influence our margins include ongoing cost inflation and the fact that with the surge in bookings, we will be early in many projects and new construction should also expand as a proportion of our revenue. These factors are especially prevalent in our modular work where we will also have ramp-up considerations as we implement new capacity. Despite these structural trends that might put some pressure on margins, we expect good continued profitability, and we are optimistic that gross margins in 2023 will be at or near the strong levels that we achieved in 2022. SG&A expense for the quarter was $132 million or 11.8% of revenue compared to $105 million or 12.3% of revenue for the fourth quarter in 2021. On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $17 million. For the full year, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 11.8% in 2022, down from 12.2% for 2021. On a same-store basis for the full year, SG&A increased $56 million, largely due to increased headcount to support our higher activity levels. Our operating income increased by 62% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $80.1 million when compared to this quarter last year. Interest expense in 2022 was higher than a year ago due to the increased interest rates on our revolving credit facility. Our average interest rate on our credit facility was 5.7% as of December 31, 2022, and we expect that with higher rates, our interest expense will increase in 2023 compared to 2022, especially early this coming year when comparable periods a year ago had much lower rates. Our tax rate for the quarter was 21%, while our full year tax rate was a negative 4% due to R&D tax benefits related to prior years. We continue to view our normalized tax rate to be approximately 22% to 23%. After considering all of the factors above, net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by over 40% to $55 million or $1.54 per share. This compares to net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $38 million or $1.04. Our full year earnings per share for 2022 was $6.82. Excluding the R&D tax benefits related to prior years, our 2022 earnings per share was $5.29, and that $5.29 earnings compares to $3.93 per share in the prior year after those adjustments. For our fourth quarter, EBITDA increased by 47% to $100 million. Our full year 2022 EBITDA has increased by 32% compared to the prior year, and it was $338 million. Full year 2022 cash flow was $256 million compared to $161 million in 2021. Our cash flow benefited from advanced payments that we negotiated as part of our modular backlog commitments that were mainly received in December. This work has not started. So receipt of this cash is reflected in a $73 million increase in our deferred revenue liabilities at the end of 2022. Our free cash flow also benefited from the $33 million refund from the IRS for the R&D tax credit that we got in the first quarter, but partially offsetting these benefits were roughly $50 million of net tax payment that we made in the fourth quarter that arose from Congress' failure so far to extend the immediate expensing of research and experimental expenditures. We expect a meaningful increase in capital expenditures in 2023 as compared to 2022. This increase will be driven by investments to build out large additional production facilities that we have leased in Texas and North Carolina to support our increased modular backlog. We began the year with just over 1 million feet of modular production space. And when our new facilities come online by midyear, that capacity will have increased to over 2 million square feet. We also expect that during 2023, we will have higher-than-normal fleet investments as we recover from deferrals and vehicle availability during the pandemic. Overall, we expect CapEx spend for 2023 of roughly $55 million to $70 million. Brian mentioned our acquisition of Eldeco earlier this month, Eldeco, is headquartered in South Carolina and performs electrical design and construction in the Southeastern region of the United States. We expect this acquisition to contribute annualized revenue of approximately $130 million to $140 million with EBITDA of $8 million to $9 million. Because of the amortization expense related to intangibles and other acquisition costs, this acquisition is expected to make a neutral to slightly accretive contribution to earnings per share in 2023 and 2024. Our debt at the end of the year was $256 million, and we were able to achieve our goal of reducing our leverage below 1 times EBITDA by year-end. Our current debt-to-EBITDA leverage stands at 0.76. We are continuing to opportunistically repurchase our shares. In 2022, we repurchased 442,000 shares at an average price of $86.45. Since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back 10.1 million shares at an average price of $24.52. And with that, that's all I have of financial, Brian.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for 2023 and on inflation and supply chain considerations. Our backlog at the end of 2022, it was a record $4.1 billion. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog increased by $1.7 billion or 75%, a broadly based increase with strong bookings in both our electrical and mechanical construction businesses. During the final three months of 2022, we augmented the increases in our traditional business with substantial new bookings in our oxide construction business. And sequentially, our same-store backlog increased $813 million despite heavy backlog burn in the fourth quarter. These early bookings will burn over a longer period and include orders that will be produced in 2024. The new bookings in our modular oxide construction operations reflected a decision by a key customer to reserve plant capacity father in advance and to thus facilitate our ability to invest to increase our capacity. As mentioned, we are doubling our capacity, further accelerating the rapid growth in modular construction that we achieved over the last few years. We believe that we have unmatched capability in complex mechanical electrical modular, including scores of professionals with unique design and engineering capability, and we are investing heavily to maintain and increase that advantage. Industrial customers were 48% of total revenue in 2022. This sector, which includes technology, life sciences and food processing will remain strong for us as industrial is heavily represented in new backlog. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government, are also strong and represented 31% of our revenue. The commercial sector is remaining active. But with our changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 21% of revenue. A significant portion of our service revenue is performed for commercial customers. So the proportion of our overall construction revenue that is commercial is low by historical standards. Construction was 78% of our full year 2022 revenue with 49% from construction projects, for new buildings and 29% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service was strong this year with 2022 service revenue of over $900 million. Service was 22% of our total revenues with service projects providing 9% of revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 13% of revenue. 2022 service revenue is up by 33%. And with our continuing strong margins, service is a great source of profit and cash flow for us. In all our activities, including both service and construction, we are encouraging and supporting our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations, and we are raising our standards in the areas of sustainability, diversity and governance. Ongoing demand is holding up, and our record backlog combined with strength in the industrial and institutional sectors lead us to expect continued growth and strong ongoing profitability in 2023. As we look ahead, our priority remains to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry, so we can continue our legacy of safely constructing, installing, maintaining, repairing and replacing our nation's buildings while helping our communities achieve sustainable growth. We are investing to meet the needs of our customers, and we are grateful for their trust. We will continue to invest in our workforce, technology and execution cables. Our skilled workforce is the heart and soul of Comfort Systems USA, and we will continue to develop and reward our unmatched team members as they strive each day to work safely, improve their communities and serve our many markets. I want to end by thanking our over 14,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn it back over to Justin for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Julio Romero from Sidoti. Your lines is now open.\nJulio Romero: I guess to start on the modular side. You guys mentioned new construction is expected to grow as a proportion of revenue, and I believe you include modular in that. Just if you could talk about what percentage of sales modular makes up today? And what does that look like in 5 years' time?\nBrian Lane: Go ahead, Bill.\nBill George: Well, so modular is 10% of our revenue, which is really, it's been 10% for a couple of years. But if you remember, we did a lot of acquisitions in '21 and '22, and we did 5 in 2021. None of those acquisitions had modular. So for modular to stay at 10%, it had to grow very, very quickly even up until now. With the new backlog, we expect modular will continue to grow and will probably start to increase as a percentage of our revenue. We project that it will gradually -- as the new capacity comes online, and keep in mind that, that will take building out 1 million square feet and getting it operational, will take a few quarters. But as that new capacity comes online, we would expect to see modular get to something like 15% of revenue even as the rest of the company continues to grow.\nJulio Romero: I guess on the backlog, how much of the backlog boost that you saw in the quarter do you attribute to the modular portion?\nBill George: Well, so in the fourth quarter, virtually all of the huge sequential jump was modular. There was -- it was specific bookings that we received in December from a customer who really was made the decision to commit to us and give us commitments in advance in order to support our ability to make some investments that we needed to make if we were going to meet the capacity needs that they had. Having said that, we had very, very heavy backlog burn in the fourth quarter. And with the huge increase in backlog in the first 9 months of this year in our other space, it's pretty impressive to me that the rest of our business kept.\nBrian Lane: Yes, yes. We're very fortunate the fourth quarter continues, opportunities are still very robust. So we'll look in that pretty consistent bookings this year.\nJulio Romero: I guess just last one for me would be just that $4 billion in backlog. Just how far out are you guys booked? And are you coming close to maybe slowing? or Are you coming close to not taking orders for '24 at this point, I guess?\nBrian Lane: No. I think for 2023, we're in pretty good shape. There will always be some small work to come in, good customers, et cetera. But we're off to a really good start for 2024. But we definitely have a lot of capacity to take in 2024. That would start in the book today.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nJulio Romero: Brian, when you look at sort of 23% same-store growth this quarter, margins expanding, it seems like your group is just doing a terrific job in terms of productivity in the field, sort of a 2-part question. What are the things you and your teams are doing so well, I guess, to manage this extraordinary growth with what looks like no parent stumbles. And then maybe kind of how that informs you and gives you the confidence around taking on an even larger backlog here?\nBrian Lane: Yes. Brent, thanks for the question. I really appreciate it. To get these results, obviously, we are getting exceptional outstanding performance from the field. And if you look at over about the last 10 years at the gross profit level, we've been performing at a really consistent level, which makes you very proud. But it's a combination of a lot of things, the companies that we've brought in, the ones we've had have a lot of good people, great leadership. We provide a lot of training, utilization of prefabrication, BIM modeling is throughout the organization. We're really getting a lot of collaboration among companies, which I think is just outstanding. It used to be 1 or 2 instances 10 years ago, and now it seems like everybody's worked on everyone. It's fantastic. The modular, as we've talked about, speak for itself. But we want to make sure everybody performed that safely, as you know, productively and make sure we're delivering a quality product for our customers, which our folks are doing. So we're just very fortunate, Brent, to have the workforce and the leadership we have direct at them.\nJulio Romero: I know you can't talk specifics about the key customer, but more interested just on the insights, their commitment to this capacity. Is it simply just sort of a sign of the capacity absorption out there? Are your competitors committed further out? And then I guess, Brian, any signs from some of your other customers looking to sort of secure your services further and further out? Or is this kind of a unique situation?\nBill George: I'm going to start with the first part of that. I think this is really a testament to that particular customer's deep understanding of what's happening right now in the United States, right? With reshoring, with the new commitments to ship manufacture to the need for battery by virtually everybody who's involved with vehicles, with frankly, the data center build-out continuing and with AI becoming denser and requiring more sophisticated mechanical and electrical. And even there are plenty of other drivers like food processing. Pet food is very, very smart, hard. Pharmaceuticals, right? That reshoring is still just in its infancy. So there is so much demand right now. I think this customer looked around and realized not everybody who wants to build in or thinks they're going to build a building in the next few years is going to end up having the building they're expecting. And so they're just making sure that they get what they need to make their business successful. I think that will begin to dawn on more and more people. We'll see.\nBrian Lane: I think you answered what he asked me to. Brent, did that answer your total question?\nJulio Romero: Yes. Yes. I guess an annoying question around the growth outlook here. I mean you've got 75% backlog growth coming into the new year. Totally recognize some of that spaced out. I guess what would you need to see to stay this low to mid-teens same-store growth outlook is too concerned and we need to kind of work through the year, see how your book and burn business is coming in. Just kind of wondering what the outlooks are there.\nBrian Lane: Yes. I think that's a really good question. It's one I think we spent a lot of time throughout the organization. And you're exactly right. What the actual number is, is nice, but it's really only when it happens, the labor availability and what the spacing of it is various times of the year, who has what resources. So right now, we're very comfortable with the labor plans we have and the resources that we have. But that's a daily situation you monitor, Brent. But we're in good shape right now with the workload, the allocation of the work and the skill sets we have.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great quarter. I guess as I'm trying to figure out the long-term modular opportunity. What would prevent you from, if you needed to, from going from 2 million square feet to 4 million square feet down the road?\nBill George: So there's no law against it. And the question is, could we manage that kind of growth? I think the answer is that's one of the great things about being Comfort Systems, right? We have -- 90% of our business is this fantastic, seasoned, incredibly valuable, really desperately needed production capability that gives us great cash flow and honestly, insights and engineering and things that we need in order to take advantage of what we think is a very important long-term trend in this industry. We think the offside or modular construction, which today is a tiny part of 1% of how things are build in the U.S., is bound to grow. And we think that the most interesting part of modular is the complex part of modular. So there were big investments by like SoftBank trying to solve modular. And everybody kept going after glorified mobile homes, things that were built of wood and structural stuff. We think that the most obvious place to get the benefits of technology and the benefits of improvement and savings and of displacing or augmenting extremely skilled labor needs is in the complex part of modular. These modular electrical mechanical plants are perfect for it. So we've thought this for years. We started slow back in 2011. We've had regular growth, regular investment. The acquisition we did at PAS was because we simply admired what they were able to do. We felt like they were the ones that really had the capability to help us, and we thought we could help them. And we just really believe it's an important feature of our go-forward ability to add value for our shareholders but also to really stay on top of the technology of our business.\nAdam Thalhimer: Switching gears. I mean you're going to have a lot of revenue this year. Just curious kind of what you're seeing in the bidding environment and if you think you can continue to grow backlog.\nBrian Lane: It's Brian. Bidding opportunities, opportunities in general are very strong. No real letup at all. So I think you'll see us at least hold out water, maybe grow a little bit as we go through the year. This is a lot of work out there with the various government funded programs, et cetera. We just need to build a lot of a lot of industrial capability, which is really in our whale house. I think what really excites me is that a lot of work that's coming out, we're working for good customers and doing work we're good at. And that's really a big help in a busy market. But in addition to construction, our service business has tripled over the last 10 years. I mean we're close to $1 billion in revenue and service, which is really given us tremendous margins and cash flow and profit as we talked about earlier. So we're talking a lot about construction here, but this service business is a really nice foundation for us as well. But in terms of the bidding market in construction, very good.\nAdam Thalhimer: Last one for me. Just a couple of numbers. Bill, can you just make it easy on us for the interest expense? Like what is it like $5 million to $4.5 million and $4 million and then in the back half?\nBill George: If you take the second half of this year and annualize that, that's about what our interest expense will be. I have no reason to think it's going to change much. Well, there is one wildcard. It's how fast we pay down debt. So you could leave that in there as upside. But that's what I would do. That's what I did when I presented it.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then did you give gross margin guidance, and I just missed them or expectations of some sort?\nBill George: Yes. So what we said was that we expect that the full year gross profit margins for Comfort will be very similar to the full year 2022. So at or near, I think, is what we said. Essentially, there are things that are going to really push against margins just like this year. The increase in new construction. We'll be early in a lot of work, even though we have started to get closeouts from the big surge of work we started a year ago. We've got a new even bigger surge, right, with this backlog. And so we'll be early in a lot of work. So we don't pull a lot of profit out of jobs when we're just starting them. And you also still have material as a percentage of cost, very high. We don't put as much margin on material as we do on labor. In fact, that's probably by far the biggest variable. Because at some point, inflation is and will normalize. And is it possible that a chiller that went up by 50% comes back down by some percentage, probably not back to where it was. So there's a lot of moving pieces. The good news is we make our money on our labor. That's much more predictable, and that's why we're so confident that we're going to have a good year and make a lot of money even in a situation where the amplitude of the wave around what could happen with revenue is pretty big. Our best estimate of revenue is mid-teens as we ramp up into this new work and new capacity and -- but we don't know.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alex Dwyer from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAlex Dwyer: Congrats on the quarter. So to stay on the margins, can we talk about gross margins by segment in 2023 and 2024? I mean, obviously, electrical had quite a run here. I'm not sure Electrical can ever like catch up on mechanical because of the service component mechanical and like the higher gross margins in mechanical with higher G&A. Is there room for Electrical to run further from now? Or what would the reason to be why or why not?\nBill George: So electrical has now achieved the same margins as mechanical in the project world. So right now, we're -- if you were to take -- mechanical, keep in mind, has more smaller projects. They have higher margin. They have more SG&A. Our average project size is bigger than electrical. But if you look at like-for-like, fully blended across our now coming up on $1 billion of electrical and $3 billion of mechanical, we're getting the same margins. We think that that's sustainable on average. Any given quarter, there can be a little bit of difference. And we think, yes. So we think it is sustainable in both mechanical and electrical, Brian.\nBrian Lane: And also on the electrical front, which service basically went to zero during COVID. In 2022, we did have a pretty good size pickup in service. So I think that gives us strength that the margins will probably be pretty close to each other.\nAlex Dwyer: And can you talk a little bit about the Eldeco acquisition you guys announced last night. Like what you guys really liked about this one? And then just more broadly on the M&A pipeline, like what are you guys seeing out there in the market? Should we expect more M&A in the near term in 2023?\nBill George: So I'd like to answer that, if you don't mind. We started talking -- the gentleman who sold us that company, his name is Allen. He is a perfect -- he and his team, and his team is fantastic. They are a perfect fit for Comfort. They're pretty much 100% industrial. They're right next to a lot of our really strong geographies. They had pre-existing respect and relationship for organizations that we had all around them. Their capabilities are really fantastic. It's a very old company. Almost everything that we like, that we feel like correlates with us being very, very happy to get teamed up with somebody is in that transaction. And I don't know. I'm extremely optimistic about that, Brian.\nBrian Lane: Yes. I mean there -- it's really a pleasure to go there. They're really terrific people, and they think they'll love being at Comfort Systems as well. As far as the M&A pipeline, we are mindful that we have a massive surge in backlog that we have to pay a lot of attention to. An awful lot of our acquisitions when we do them, they are coming into existing operations where there is -- it requires effort for collaboration and integration. And so we are going to continue during '22 and then certainly going into '23, we will not hesitate to buy some company that like with Allen, we've been talking to for years and they're ready to sell, but we're not going to have our put on the accelerator. We're going to be very, very judicious mostly because our opportunity is so big in our existing operations that we still -- we're still doing good work absorbing the 5 significant deals we did in '21. And for us, there's no quota. For us, it's a matter of if we have -- we're finding the right people, we have conviction we're all go. But right now, we're going to be a little slow to go try to talk somebody into the fact that it's time that we're all busy.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up question from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nJulio Romero: Maybe just one more on the acquisition. Brian, Bill, I kind of seem to remember a year ago or a little less than a year ago, maybe you wanted to take you put off the accelerator just from the standpoint of kind of monitoring what's going on in this economy, and to see a deal seems to be encouraging in terms of what you see going forward. I mean is the idea that you'll take this in a simply a measured pace just because the business is growing so fast? Are you -- you feel like you have more confidence in your end markets sitting here kind of 9, 12 months later?\nBill George: Well, I can certainly tell you that for a company that's sitting in South Carolina, right, which is in a very favorable geography for reshoring and that has the capabilities to do the exact kind of work that's needed for all of the reshoring verticals that we just talked about, it's very, very easy to do that. Now would I be as quick to buy something in some remote part of the West that's building a lot of haptens and stuff. There's nothing wrong with that business. But I do think we would be much more mindful of sort of where people are and what they're good at. We love all of those businesses, but we think there's just especially good time to have this industrial capability.\nJulio Romero: And then I guess with all the different factors that can influence the margin, would deflation be a bit of a tailwind here this year? Or has it not been enough to matter?\nBill George: If deflation materializes, which has not, it would be selective deflation on things where people just we got a premium temporarily because of shortages. It is certainly the case where we could have some -- we could have a quarter where that added a little bit to our earnings, right? But that would not be like a permanent change in our ability to earn money or anything. And our customers stood by us very, very well, really in a remarkable way they were willing to help us when these costs be unexpectedly came along. We're going to be very, very slow to take advantage of them on the other end of that. We play a very, very long game at Comfort. We are in -- of our 40 or so businesses, 30 of them are in midsized cities where we are doing the work for the same people decade in and decade out. And we don't have to extract every penny from these people every chance we get, right? We play a very long game on that point of view, and it stood us in very, very good stead.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay, Justin. In closing, I really want to thank everyone for joining the call and your interest in Comfort Systems. And once again, thank our diligent employees. We are very proud of 2022 and very excited about 2023 and ready to get on with it. So be safe, and we'll see you all soon. Take care. Thank you.\nBill George: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Lane",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to report a great finish to 2022 with increased revenue, record earnings, fantastic cash flow and a surge of backlog. Our teams delivered amazing execution, and we are grateful for their hard work. For the fourth quarter, we earned $1.54 per share on revenue of $1.1 billion. Full year revenue surpassed $4 billion and included same-store revenue growth of 22%. Backlog received an especially strong lift this quarter and our modular off-site construction operations as large customer purchases were committed in advance to support our ability to invest in modular construction capacity. Our backlog is now over $4 billion, a same-store increase of 75% from a year ago. Cash flow was also extraordinary in the fourth quarter. And for the full year, our cash flow exceeded our excellent earnings by a substantial amount. We are excited to announce that on February 1, we acquired Eldeco, a premier industrial electrical based in South Carolina. Eldeco will further strengthen our Electrical segment. And thanks to its capabilities and relationships in a perfectly located market for us, we believe that this combination will allow us to achieve important synergies over the coming years. We also declared a larger-than-normal increase in our dividend of $0.025 per share, which increases our quarterly payout to $0.175 per share. This increase reflects our continuing strong cash flow and our desire to reward our shareholders. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes. But first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? Okay. Thanks, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for 2023 and on inflation and supply chain considerations. Our backlog at the end of 2022, it was a record $4.1 billion. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog increased by $1.7 billion or 75%, a broadly based increase with strong bookings in both our electrical and mechanical construction businesses. During the final three months of 2022, we augmented the increases in our traditional business with substantial new bookings in our oxide construction business. And sequentially, our same-store backlog increased $813 million despite heavy backlog burn in the fourth quarter. These early bookings will burn over a longer period and include orders that will be produced in 2024. The new bookings in our modular oxide construction operations reflected a decision by a key customer to reserve plant capacity father in advance and to thus facilitate our ability to invest to increase our capacity. As mentioned, we are doubling our capacity, further accelerating the rapid growth in modular construction that we achieved over the last few years. We believe that we have unmatched capability in complex mechanical electrical modular, including scores of professionals with unique design and engineering capability, and we are investing heavily to maintain and increase that advantage. Industrial customers were 48% of total revenue in 2022. This sector, which includes technology, life sciences and food processing will remain strong for us as industrial is heavily represented in new backlog. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government, are also strong and represented 31% of our revenue. The commercial sector is remaining active. But with our changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 21% of revenue. A significant portion of our service revenue is performed for commercial customers. So the proportion of our overall construction revenue that is commercial is low by historical standards. Construction was 78% of our full year 2022 revenue with 49% from construction projects, for new buildings and 29% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service was strong this year with 2022 service revenue of over $900 million. Service was 22% of our total revenues with service projects providing 9% of revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 13% of revenue. 2022 service revenue is up by 33%. And with our continuing strong margins, service is a great source of profit and cash flow for us. In all our activities, including both service and construction, we are encouraging and supporting our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations, and we are raising our standards in the areas of sustainability, diversity and governance. Ongoing demand is holding up, and our record backlog combined with strength in the industrial and institutional sectors lead us to expect continued growth and strong ongoing profitability in 2023. As we look ahead, our priority remains to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry, so we can continue our legacy of safely constructing, installing, maintaining, repairing and replacing our nation's buildings while helping our communities achieve sustainable growth. We are investing to meet the needs of our customers, and we are grateful for their trust. We will continue to invest in our workforce, technology and execution cables. Our skilled workforce is the heart and soul of Comfort Systems USA, and we will continue to develop and reward our unmatched team members as they strive each day to work safely, improve their communities and serve our many markets. I want to end by thanking our over 14,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn it back over to Justin for questions. Thank you. Go ahead, Bill. Yes, yes. We're very fortunate the fourth quarter continues, opportunities are still very robust. So we'll look in that pretty consistent bookings this year. No. I think for 2023, we're in pretty good shape. There will always be some small work to come in, good customers, et cetera. But we're off to a really good start for 2024. But we definitely have a lot of capacity to take in 2024. That would start in the book today. Yes. Brent, thanks for the question. I really appreciate it. To get these results, obviously, we are getting exceptional outstanding performance from the field. And if you look at over about the last 10 years at the gross profit level, we've been performing at a really consistent level, which makes you very proud.

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. So revenue for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $1.1 billion, an increase of $261 million or 30% compared to last year. Same-store revenue increased by $200 million or 23%, with the remaining $61 million increase resulting from our acquisitions. Revenue for the full year 2022 increased by more than 35% compared to 2021 to $4.1 billion. Our full year Mechanical Services segment revenue increased $636 million or 25%, and our Electrical Services segment increased by 81% to $431 million. Same-store revenue increased by 22% or $669 million in 2022, a broad-based increase driven by strong ongoing market conditions. Inflation of equipment and materials also contributed to revenue growth. With respect to revenue prospects for 2023, our growth is hard to predict because of unknown inflation developments and potential variability and the timing and revenue contribution of new bookings. However, we currently estimate 2023 same-store revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens for the full year with larger percentage increases likely to occur earlier in the year considering prior comparables. Gross profit was $211 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, a $57 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage was 18.9% this quarter compared to 18.0% for the fourth quarter of 2021. Quarterly gross profit percentage in our Mechanical segment increased to 19.1%, while margins in the Electrical segment rose significantly to 18.2% this year from 14.8% in 2021. For the full year 2022, gross profit increased by $178 million, and our gross profit margin was 17.9% in 2022 as compared to 18.3% in 2021. Our full year gross profit margin held up remarkably well considering the spike in revenue, the relative increase in construction and the changes in our cost mix as higher prices meant the materials increased as a proportion of our cost and revenues. It is currently challenging to predict how our margins will unfold in 2023. Important factors that will influence our margins include ongoing cost inflation and the fact that with the surge in bookings, we will be early in many projects and new construction should also expand as a proportion of our revenue. These factors are especially prevalent in our modular work where we will also have ramp-up considerations as we implement new capacity. Despite these structural trends that might put some pressure on margins, we expect good continued profitability, and we are optimistic that gross margins in 2023 will be at or near the strong levels that we achieved in 2022. SG&A expense for the quarter was $132 million or 11.8% of revenue compared to $105 million or 12.3% of revenue for the fourth quarter in 2021. On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $17 million. For the full year, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 11.8% in 2022, down from 12.2% for 2021. On a same-store basis for the full year, SG&A increased $56 million, largely due to increased headcount to support our higher activity levels. Our operating income increased by 62% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to $80.1 million when compared to this quarter last year. Interest expense in 2022 was higher than a year ago due to the increased interest rates on our revolving credit facility. Our average interest rate on our credit facility was 5.7% as of December 31, 2022, and we expect that with higher rates, our interest expense will increase in 2023 compared to 2022, especially early this coming year when comparable periods a year ago had much lower rates. Our tax rate for the quarter was 21%, while our full year tax rate was a negative 4% due to R&D tax benefits related to prior years. We continue to view our normalized tax rate to be approximately 22% to 23%. After considering all of the factors above, net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 increased by over 40% to $55 million or $1.54 per share. This compares to net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 of $38 million or $1.04. Our full year earnings per share for 2022 was $6.82. Excluding the R&D tax benefits related to prior years, our 2022 earnings per share was $5.29, and that $5.29 earnings compares to $3.93 per share in the prior year after those adjustments. For our fourth quarter, EBITDA increased by 47% to $100 million. Our full year 2022 EBITDA has increased by 32% compared to the prior year, and it was $338 million. Full year 2022 cash flow was $256 million compared to $161 million in 2021. Our cash flow benefited from advanced payments that we negotiated as part of our modular backlog commitments that were mainly received in December. This work has not started. So receipt of this cash is reflected in a $73 million increase in our deferred revenue liabilities at the end of 2022. Our free cash flow also benefited from the $33 million refund from the IRS for the R&D tax credit that we got in the first quarter, but partially offsetting these benefits were roughly $50 million of net tax payment that we made in the fourth quarter that arose from Congress' failure so far to extend the immediate expensing of research and experimental expenditures. We expect a meaningful increase in capital expenditures in 2023 as compared to 2022. This increase will be driven by investments to build out large additional production facilities that we have leased in Texas and North Carolina to support our increased modular backlog. We began the year with just over 1 million feet of modular production space. And when our new facilities come online by midyear, that capacity will have increased to over 2 million square feet. We also expect that during 2023, we will have higher-than-normal fleet investments as we recover from deferrals and vehicle availability during the pandemic. Overall, we expect CapEx spend for 2023 of roughly $55 million to $70 million. Brian mentioned our acquisition of Eldeco earlier this month, Eldeco, is headquartered in South Carolina and performs electrical design and construction in the Southeastern region of the United States. We expect this acquisition to contribute annualized revenue of approximately $130 million to $140 million with EBITDA of $8 million to $9 million. Because of the amortization expense related to intangibles and other acquisition costs, this acquisition is expected to make a neutral to slightly accretive contribution to earnings per share in 2023 and 2024. Our debt at the end of the year was $256 million, and we were able to achieve our goal of reducing our leverage below 1 times EBITDA by year-end. Our current debt-to-EBITDA leverage stands at 0.76. We are continuing to opportunistically repurchase our shares. In 2022, we repurchased 442,000 shares at an average price of $86.45. Since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back 10.1 million shares at an average price of $24.52. And with that, that's all I have of financial, Brian. Well, so modular is 10% of our revenue, which is really, it's been 10% for a couple of years. But if you remember, we did a lot of acquisitions in '21 and '22, and we did 5 in 2021. None of those acquisitions had modular. So for modular to stay at 10%, it had to grow very, very quickly even up until now. With the new backlog, we expect modular will continue to grow and will probably start to increase as a percentage of our revenue. We project that it will gradually -- as the new capacity comes online, and keep in mind that, that will take building out 1 million square feet and getting it operational, will take a few quarters. But as that new capacity comes online, we would expect to see modular get to something like 15% of revenue even as the rest of the company continues to grow. Well, so in the fourth quarter, virtually all of the huge sequential jump was modular. There was -- it was specific bookings that we received in December from a customer who really was made the decision to commit to us and give us commitments in advance in order to support our ability to make some investments that we needed to make if we were going to meet the capacity needs that they had. Having said that, we had very, very heavy backlog burn in the fourth quarter. And with the huge increase in backlog in the first 9 months of this year in our other space, it's pretty impressive to me that the rest of our business kept. I'm going to start with the first part of that. I think this is really a testament to that particular customer's deep understanding of what's happening right now in the United States, right? With reshoring, with the new commitments to ship manufacture to the need for battery by virtually everybody who's involved with vehicles, with frankly, the data center build-out continuing and with AI becoming denser and requiring more sophisticated mechanical and electrical. And even there are plenty of other drivers like food processing. Pet food is very, very smart, hard. Pharmaceuticals, right? That reshoring is still just in its infancy. So there is so much demand right now. I think this customer looked around and realized not everybody who wants to build in or thinks they're going to build a building in the next few years is going to end up having the building they're expecting. And so they're just making sure that they get what they need to make their business successful. I think that will begin to dawn on more and more people. We'll see. So there's no law against it. And the question is, could we manage that kind of growth? I think the answer is that's one of the great things about being Comfort Systems, right? We have -- 90% of our business is this fantastic, seasoned, incredibly valuable, really desperately needed production capability that gives us great cash flow and honestly, insights and engineering and things that we need in order to take advantage of what we think is a very important long-term trend in this industry. We think the offside or modular construction, which today is a tiny part of 1% of how things are build in the U.S., is bound to grow. And we think that the most interesting part of modular is the complex part of modular. So there were big investments by like SoftBank trying to solve modular. And everybody kept going after glorified mobile homes, things that were built of wood and structural stuff. We think that the most obvious place to get the benefits of technology and the benefits of improvement and savings and of displacing or augmenting extremely skilled labor needs is in the complex part of modular. These modular electrical mechanical plants are perfect for it. So we've thought this for years. We started slow back in 2011. We've had regular growth, regular investment. The acquisition we did at PAS was because we simply admired what they were able to do. We felt like they were the ones that really had the capability to help us, and we thought we could help them. And we just really believe it's an important feature of our go-forward ability to add value for our shareholders but also to really stay on top of the technology of our business. If you take the second half of this year and annualize that, that's about what our interest expense will be. I have no reason to think it's going to change much. Well, there is one wildcard. It's how fast we pay down debt. So you could leave that in there as upside. But that's what I would do. That's what I did when I presented it. Yes. So what we said was that we expect that the full year gross profit margins for Comfort will be very similar to the full year 2022. So at or near, I think, is what we said. Essentially, there are things that are going to really push against margins just like this year. The increase in new construction. We'll be early in a lot of work, even though we have started to get closeouts from the big surge of work we started a year ago. We've got a new even bigger surge, right, with this backlog. And so we'll be early in a lot of work. So we don't pull a lot of profit out of jobs when we're just starting them. And you also still have material as a percentage of cost, very high. We don't put as much margin on material as we do on labor. In fact, that's probably by far the biggest variable. Because at some point, inflation is and will normalize. And is it possible that a chiller that went up by 50% comes back down by some percentage, probably not back to where it was. So there's a lot of moving pieces. The good news is we make our money on our labor. That's much more predictable, and that's why we're so confident that we're going to have a good year and make a lot of money even in a situation where the amplitude of the wave around what could happen with revenue is pretty big. Our best estimate of revenue is mid-teens as we ramp up into this new work and new capacity and -- but we don't know. So electrical has now achieved the same margins as mechanical in the project world. So right now, we're -- if you were to take -- mechanical, keep in mind, has more smaller projects. They have higher margin. They have more SG&A. Our average project size is bigger than electrical. But if you look at like-for-like, fully blended across our now coming up on $1 billion of electrical and $3 billion of mechanical, we're getting the same margins. We think that that's sustainable on average. Any given quarter, there can be a little bit of difference. And we think, yes. So we think it is sustainable in both mechanical and electrical, Brian. So I'd like to answer that, if you don't mind. We started talking -- the gentleman who sold us that company, his name is Allen. He is a perfect -- he and his team, and his team is fantastic. They are a perfect fit for Comfort. They're pretty much 100% industrial. They're right next to a lot of our really strong geographies. They had pre-existing respect and relationship for organizations that we had all around them. Their capabilities are really fantastic. It's a very old company. Almost everything that we like, that we feel like correlates with us being very, very happy to get teamed up with somebody is in that transaction. And I don't know. I'm extremely optimistic about that, Brian. Well, I can certainly tell you that for a company that's sitting in South Carolina, right, which is in a very favorable geography for reshoring and that has the capabilities to do the exact kind of work that's needed for all of the reshoring verticals that we just talked about, it's very, very easy to do that. Now would I be as quick to buy something in some remote part of the West that's building a lot of haptens and stuff. There's nothing wrong with that business. But I do think we would be much more mindful of sort of where people are and what they're good at. We love all of those businesses, but we think there's just especially good time to have this industrial capability. If deflation materializes, which has not, it would be selective deflation on things where people just we got a premium temporarily because of shortages. It is certainly the case where we could have some -- we could have a quarter where that added a little bit to our earnings, right? But that would not be like a permanent change in our ability to earn money or anything. And our customers stood by us very, very well, really in a remarkable way they were willing to help us when these costs be unexpectedly came along. We're going to be very, very slow to take advantage of them on the other end of that. We play a very, very long game at Comfort. We are in -- of our 40 or so businesses, 30 of them are in midsized cities where we are doing the work for the same people decade in and decade out. And we don't have to extract every penny from these people every chance we get, right? We play a very long game on that point of view, and it stood us in very, very good stead. Thanks, everyone."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Anthony. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our comments today, as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws and regulations.  What we will say today is based upon the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments.  You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks.  The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer.  Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We had another great quarter with continued increases in revenue, earnings and backlog, and we are really grateful for the success created by our employees amid unique challenges.  We earned $1.71 per share this quarter compared to $1.27 a year ago. Our results this quarter included a net gain of $0.10 per share related to legal matters and $0.04 related to tax benefits from prior years. This quarter marks the first time that we have achieved $100 million in EBITDA in a single quarter.  Strong activity levels and ongoing cost increases in equipment and other inputs have again produced same-store revenue growth of over 20%. Bookings increased this quarter and we continue to experience solid bidding and planning activity. Our strong cash flow also continues and is especially satisfying since we are investing working capital to support our growth. We have also announced an increase in our dividend to $0.15 this quarter.  I will discuss our business and outlook shortly. But first, I'll turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nWilliam George: Thanks, Brian, and good morning. Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $1.12 billion, an increase of $286 million or 34% compared to last year. Our recent acquisitions contributed a total of $97 million of new quarterly revenue. And so we had same-store revenue growth of $198 million or about 23%. That sharp increase in revenue was broad-based and was driven by strong market conditions. Inflation of equipment and materials also contributed to revenue growth.  Our same-store revenue increased by 23% in the third quarter and same-store employee headcount increased by 8% in the same time frame. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect double-digit same-store revenue growth, although there are more variables than usual.  Gross profit was $202 million for the third quarter of 2022, a $43 million increase compared to last year and the first time we have ever reported over $200 million of gross profit in a single quarter. Our gross profit percentage was 18.1% this quarter compared to 19.1% for the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in gross profit percentage resulted from the change in project mix, including the pass-through of inflated materials and equipment costs.  Gross profit percentage was impacted by a decline in gross profit margins in our Mechanical segment compared to extraordinary performance last year, partially offset by a strong increase in the Electrical segment, which was further enhanced by a job-related litigation gain.  SG&A expense for the quarter was $121 million or 10.8% of revenue compared to $95 million or 11.4% of revenue for the third quarter of 2021. Most of the dollar increase is from new companies. Our operating income increased by 27% or $17 million as compared to the third quarter of 2021.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 17.4%. During the current quarter, we filed our 2021 federal tax return and we included the R&D tax credit in this original return. And as a result, we increased our estimated tax benefit related to the R&D tax credit for the current year, as well as for the years 2019 to 2021. And that was a gain of $0.04 for the third quarter of 2022 that related to prior years. We continue to view our normalized tax rate to be approximately 22% to 23%.  Net income for the third quarter of 2022 was $62 million or $1.71 per share. The $1.71 per share includes the 10% net gain related to legal matters and $0.04 related to the revised estimate for the R&D tax credit related to 2019 to 2021. Net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $46 million or $1.27 per share by comparison.  EBITDA increased from $82 million in the third quarter last year to $101 million this quarter, a 23% year-over-year EBITDA increase. As Brian pointed out, this is the first time in our history that we've achieved over $100 million of EBITDA in a single quarter.  Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2022 was $137 million, including the $33 million refund from the IRS tax credit in the first quarter. This is a strong cash flow considering the investments we're making in working capital as we fund our growth. Our debt at the end of September was $381 million and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio at quarter end stands at  We are actively repurchasing our shares. And in the first 9 months of 2022, we have repurchased 425,000 shares for approximately $36 million. So go ahead, Brian.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets, and I will comment on our outlook for the rest of 2022 and 2023, and on inflation and supply chain considerations.  Our backlog at the end of September was $3.25 billion. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog is up $1.1 billion or 57%, with increases across most of our operations. Sequentially, our same-store backlog increased $443 million, which is remarkable for a third quarter as we are also burning backlog at record levels.  In addition to strong demand in technology and other industrial sectors, an important factor driving our backlog higher is that our customers are committing orders to lock in our labor so that we can place equipment orders earlier in order to allow for exceptionally long lead times from manufacturers. Industrial revenue was 47% of our revenue in the first 9 months of 2022. This sector, which includes technology, life sciences and food processing remains strong and is very, very heavily represented in new backlog and in our pipeline.  Institutional markets, including education, health care and government are solid and represent 32% of our revenue, consistent with last year. Finally, the commercial sector remains active. But without changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 21% of revenue.  Year-to-date, construction was 78% of our revenue, with 48% from construction projects for new buildings and 30% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service was particularly strong during the third quarter. Overall, service is 22% of our year-to-date revenue with service projects providing 9% of our revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 13% of revenue. Year-to-date service revenue is $674 million, a 33% increase with same-store service revenue up by 16%. Service continues to be a consistent and growing source of profit and cash flow at Comfort Systems.  In all our activities, including both service and construction, we are encouraging and supporting our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations. And we are raising our own standards in the areas of sustainability, diversity and governance.  Inflation is widespread, and we expect continued challenges in the cost and availability of the inputs that we use to serve our customers. Although conditions are hard to predict in the near term, we are recognizing these challenges in our job planning and pricing. And we are working to order materials earlier than usual, while seeking to collaborate with customers to share supply risk and to mitigate these challenges.  We have a very good pipeline of opportunities. And so far, we have been able to maintain activity levels and productivity despite supply chain challenges. We are watchful of world events and Fed tightening. However, given ongoing demand, our record backlog and strength in the industrial and institutional sectors, we anticipate continued strong earnings and cash flow in the coming quarters.  As we look ahead, our priority is to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry, so we can continue our legacy of safely constructing, installing, maintaining, repairing and replacing our nation's buildings, while helping our communities achieve sustainable growth.  With the highest backlog in the history of Comfort Systems USA, we will continue to invest in our workforce, technology and execution capabilities. Thanks to our amazing workforce, we are optimistic about the remainder of 2022 and 2023.  I want to end by thanking our 14,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Anthony for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Julio Romero with Sidoti & Co.\nJulio Romero: Starting on the revenue, the organic growth, it's the second straight quarter of 20%-plus growth, broke $1 billion in organic sales, in sales, I should say. Just talk about the trend line for organic growth, exit cost pass-throughs. I know you mentioned same-store headcount of up 8%. Is that kind of the baseline for organic growth?\nWilliam George: Yes. So no, I would not say that's the baseline because, of course, we're charging more for those 8%, right? So there is inflation in that number. And also, our temporary labor is up quite a lot by more than 8%. So I think the best -- our best -- you can't know what would have happened without inflation, but our best estimate continues to be that about half of our same-store growth is caused by inflation and market conditions, and about half of our same-store growth is just us doing more work, true underlying growth.  And as far as the first part of your question about sort of the trend line, so we are still -- we had a reasonably soft comparables compared to a year ago, we were still coming out of COVID. The comparables get a little tougher in the fourth and first quarter, but there's still really favorable comparables if all you are looking for is same-store revenue growth. By the second quarter of next year, we'll be comping, and for the rest of next year, we'll be comping to these big numbers we're posting right now that are -- our second quarter was up 25%.  So a year from now, depending on what inflation is doing, it's much, much harder to prognosticate that you're going to grow from there. Even if we don't -- and by the way, if inflation abates, right, that could create at least some of sort of a turnaround in that effect. But I would say we don't think that would mean we would earn less money. In fact, if anything, it could be slightly favorable if prices were to get better.  So what you would see is you'd see lower revenue growth, but of course, the margins would get better because we'd have less of that material pass-through. So long question, but it's a complicated situation as well -- long answer, I'm sorry.\nJulio Romero: No, totally. And I appreciate the comprehensive answer there. Just on the increase in bookings, it's up almost $500 million sequentially. Just how much of that, are you able to parse out how much of that is driven by the larger industrial projects that are kind of committing earlier?\nBrian Lane: Yes. Julio, it's Brian. So it's -- we've got broad-based increase in backlog, to be honest. But for sure, we are getting increased bookings, and you'll see that continue into the fourth quarter. But the backlog increase, quite frankly, is broad-based.\nWilliam George: And coincidentally, service was up by exactly the same percentage year-over-year as construction. So I think it's really -- it's all across the board that gain. But for sure, you'll probably see in the coming quarters, more of that coming from these industrial bookings because they're just so big. And also this third quarters are always strong service quarters.\nJulio Romero: Understood. And then maybe last one for me is on the segments. This is the first time that electrical gross margins outpaced mechanical. Is that kind of an inflection point for the electrical segment? Have you kind of reached some critical mass where you start to see some better operating leverage there?\nBrian Lane: Yes. Well, I mean, we've had pretty consistent steady state growth in gross margins. I mean I think we have really terrific electrical companies. We had a challenging job a few years ago, they got helped by litigation pickup for sure, but we have improved significantly better across the board in electrical. And I'm pretty optimistic we'll continue to see improvement in the gross margins as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc.\nSean Eastman: Fantastic quarter. Many complements. So this kind of early project commitments dynamic that is part of the momentum in the bookings we're seeing in the quarter, how would you characterize the duration of the backlog at this point? And does this early commitment on order suggests there's some pull forward in the bookings we're seeing this quarter? Or is the message that, that bookings momentum still continues post quarter end?\nWilliam George: So definitely, there's more -- there's pull forward, right? I mean, because if they book earlier, they booked earlier than they would have been. Now does that mean they won't continue to book heavily? The question is, at some point, do they stop booking earlier because the lead times for equipment become less or because the market softens? And I think there's certainly no sign of that in what's actually happening in our business. Of course, we don't know that could change in a month or a year. But right now, I don't know, Brian, it's very robust.\nBrian Lane: Yes. It's very robust. And we're even seeing our backlog extends -- it's for the highest number we've had longer than a year, Sean. So we've seen -- it's been the opposite. I think it's actually picked up, quite frankly.\nWilliam George: We have companies that aren't selling for 2023, they're full. And as you think about that, that's why people are committing earlier because we understand, oh, these guys are getting full. If we want a building, we better get.\nBrian Lane: And equipment is one thing, you also got the labor, right? You got to make -- they want to make sure there are people to do it.\nSean Eastman: Yes. So kind of fair to say that pretty abnormally high visibility for 2023 at this point?\nWilliam George: Unprecedented.\nBrian Lane: Unprecedented. At least since -- in the 20 years I've been here, for sure.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. And then just this notion of locking up your labor resources early. You guys are kind of the -- I mean, there's a lot of scarcity in the system, I suppose, but the labor resource is a really kind of core scarce resource in the project life cycle. And I just wonder how you think about monetizing, locking up those resources early, particularly in kind of an uncertain cost environment as well?\nWilliam George: Well, as you might imagine, if someone in one of the many, many cities we're working at is very busy. If you want them to do work, you're going to have to pay them well for it. So our -- you can see it in our numbers, right?\nBrian Lane: Yes. You can see it in the results, Sean. We are very fortunate here. At the operating company level, these folks have a really good handle on the markets they are playing in, in terms of all facets of the business. And we're very fortunate with the companies we have today.\nSean Eastman: Yes, we can see that. And maybe one last quick one for Bil on M&A., obviously, the last couple of years has been quite active. It's been quite a good story for you guys. Any message on, say, the next 1 to 2 years in terms of what's in the pipeline and what we could expect to see?\nWilliam George: It's certainly -- so we have 2 things going on in M&A. One is there are people we've just talked to for years, we're friends. And when they're ready to sell, we are there. We've worked on it for years, and we may -- you may see some M&A for sure. But in general, we do think that the market is changing, that the cost of capital has an effect on what people are willing to -- people are willing to invest capital, and that there are a lot of companies for sale right now. And I don't mean the company we usually buy. I mean, companies owned by private investors. There are -- I'd say there's 3x as many pitched booked on the street that I've ever seen.  So I think it's a moment of inflection, and I think we're going to be very, very careful. We've said forever, we don't have to do a deal in any given year, right? We just want to create value over a -- we play a very, very long game for this. So I know it's a bit of a mixed answer, but there's really 2 parts. And I would say we're going to be very, very, very watchful right now.\nBrian Lane: Sean, Bill keeps his track that he's had for the last 10 years, we'll be in good shape.\nSean Eastman: Yes.Yes. No doubt about that.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Just out of curiosity, can you just follow-up on that, Bill, on the 3x the amount of book floating around? Why do you think that is?\nWilliam George: I think it's because if you were somebody -- you were an investment firm for whom a business really is inventory, right? If you have a lot of inventory, you might not want to hold that inventory over the next year. So you might want to at least test the market. So I think that it's really astounding, quite honestly. Maybe I'm speaking out of school. But in general, everything is for sale. It's everything that it's owned by people who trade businesses seems to be for everything I know of is there at least testing the market.  Now do I think they're succeeding in selling these businesses? I wouldn't rule it out, but I don't know because we're not super active. We take a hard look at some of the really best stuff, not -- but in general, we don't participate in any of that. We like to get to know people over years, right? And that's not really how that works.  [indiscernible] things that other people have been assembling, right? We were very, very careful. We don't -- we really understand how hard that is and that how hard it is to put stuff together in ways that will last for decades, right? So we're very -- so far, we've never bought a company. We've never bought a contractor from anybody, but a human being who owned it and lives in it and loves it. Never done it.\nAdam Thalhimer: What would be the appetite? I mean you added electrical and you're doing well there. What would be the appetite to add something else to the portfolio?\nWilliam George: Well, there's not much need to for the foreseeable future. So it would have to be something we really felt like we had a reason to expect synergy from, right? And by the way, we did. We added a labor company. But in a way that matters to you that creates a new segment, I just, I think, we're just barely getting started with a...\nBrian Lane: I think we see a lot of opportunity, Adam, and just continuing to improve the mechanical electrical businesses that we're in. I think there's constant improvement, and it's pretty exciting. So we'll keep it that, I think.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then I guess I got to ask one nitpicky one. Just on the margin outlook. What are your thoughts on margins Q4 and next year? And some of that relates to like the -- where we were in these jobs when you start to finish up some large jobs that got started over the last year, 1.5 years?\nBrian Lane: Well, I'm really happy with the margins that we're cranking out right now. We are 18.1%, as I said, probably a trillion times, you're 17.5%, 18%, above that, I think you're really performing well in the field. I think we're getting terrific productivity. I think we can maintain that level. You might get a little improvement as service continues to grow, right? We're getting some good margin help from there. But if we continue to perform in the field, that 18% range is definitely doable. And I think that's a really good number for us to be around.\nAdam Thalhimer: Q4 and next year? Or it might dip down in Q4, right?\nWilliam George: So Adam, there's a variable here that we don't know, which is, right now, our volumes are lower because of the pass-through are very -- in our cost of goods sold, materials and equipment are 3 points higher of that proportion, not 3% higher in total, but 3 points of the 100% higher of our cost, and that has that materials and equipment passes through at a lower margin. So I think what one of the things you could -- one way to look at it is we think the margins we're getting on our labor right now are stupendous and we would be very happy with them to stay the same forever. Behind that, there's some mix issues where if you made me pick, I'd expect our margins to be higher next year, but that's the assumption in that. The unknowable assumption is I'm assuming inflation gets under control.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: Just sort of tailed with Adam's question, I think Julio's as well in that. I guess, more around the electrical business. If you just take away the inflationary element, have your longer-term expectations for margins in that business change just given the performance years of late? And of course, what would those be if they have?\nBrian Lane: Well, absolutely, right? The goal of everything we do operationally is to improve, right, to improve our margins, to improve our productivity, improve our efficiency, quality, safety. So we're continuing to work on the electrical business. The companies are. We've had nice steady state improvement. We'll see -- you've got to do it, right? It's easy to talk about it.  But I think you will see continued improvement where we get to? I really don't know. But I'm pretty optimistic about the Electrical business margin improvement.\nWilliam George: And I want to say, it's not that we're now expecting higher margins. We expected higher margins last year and the year before. We had a little bit of softness. But one of the interesting things you saw this quarter was we had a gain on a job-related -- a big job-related litigation in electrical. Well, essentially, what that was, was I was an arbitrator saying, oh, yes, they didn't barely compensate you for work you did in 2 years starting last year, really starting the year before. We actually did better in electrical. That money should be pushed back to them. And I think they're new -- so I think the margins they're at now are their normal margins. And I think there is some upside in electrical margins.  Now having said that, keep in mind, the margin you're seeing, that 19%, has that gain from that -- so the margins, if you back out the gain from that litigation win, they're still a little below mechanical, but they're really, right, they're all kind of bunched together. And I think...\nBrian Lane: But I think they can get there to be the same.\nWilliam George: Yes. I think there -- on the construction side, I think electrical is every bit as -- if not -- it's every bit as profitable.\nBrian Lane: I'm very optimistic about our electrical companies, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: Yes. Really helpful. Just a follow-up. I wanted to get your thoughts, the 179D energy efficiency deduction, I think, got revised with the IRA, Inflation Reduction Act. Any thoughts on the potential implications here for the industry?\nWilliam George: Yes. So we get -- if you look back at our last several years, we don't call it out separately, although you could find it in some places if you look carefully. We've gotten a few pennies from that, right? Here's what happens. With the 179D, the customer gets that unless it's like a public company, where it's a public -- I mean, sorry, a public entity. When it's a public entity, we can get take that deduction and give them some benefit for it. So we've had direct few cents of EPS for 179D for a while.  In addition, it encourages people to do more work, especially more renovation work. And now they've, I think, more than doubled it. So one of the things we think might happen is at the margin that will create more renovation work, which will be helpful to us. It may or may not increase. We may -- the direct benefit we get may or may not go up just because it was small to start with, and also it's easier for somebody to pass the benefit along when it's smaller, it's possible they'll demand more for it if it gets bigger because they're kind of -- it's not big enough now for them to pay much attention to.  But in general, it can only be a positive. But let me tell you something. That's just one of many positives, and the bigger positive is like reshoring, you know what I mean. But it's -- a lot of things are pointing in the same direction, that's for sure.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Lane for any closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thank you. In closing, I really want to thank again our tremendous workforce, and it's throughout the organization. We're getting tremendous performance from everybody, and I really appreciate it. We also really thank everybody for your interest in Comfort Systems and your time today. We are grateful for the questions and the interest for sure. So everybody be safe out there and hope you enjoy the upcoming holiday season. Thanks, and have a great day.\nWilliam George: Thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. We had another great quarter with continued increases in revenue, earnings and backlog, and we are really grateful for the success created by our employees amid unique challenges.  We earned $1.71 per share this quarter compared to $1.27 a year ago. Our results this quarter included a net gain of $0.10 per share related to legal matters and $0.04 related to tax benefits from prior years. This quarter marks the first time that we have achieved $100 million in EBITDA in a single quarter.  Strong activity levels and ongoing cost increases in equipment and other inputs have again produced same-store revenue growth of over 20%. Bookings increased this quarter and we continue to experience solid bidding and planning activity. Our strong cash flow also continues and is especially satisfying since we are investing working capital to support our growth. We have also announced an increase in our dividend to $0.15 this quarter.  I will discuss our business and outlook shortly. But first, I'll turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? All right. Thanks, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets, and I will comment on our outlook for the rest of 2022 and 2023, and on inflation and supply chain considerations.  Our backlog at the end of September was $3.25 billion. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog is up $1.1 billion or 57%, with increases across most of our operations. Sequentially, our same-store backlog increased $443 million, which is remarkable for a third quarter as we are also burning backlog at record levels.  In addition to strong demand in technology and other industrial sectors, an important factor driving our backlog higher is that our customers are committing orders to lock in our labor so that we can place equipment orders earlier in order to allow for exceptionally long lead times from manufacturers. Industrial revenue was 47% of our revenue in the first 9 months of 2022. This sector, which includes technology, life sciences and food processing remains strong and is very, very heavily represented in new backlog and in our pipeline.  Institutional markets, including education, health care and government are solid and represent 32% of our revenue, consistent with last year. Finally, the commercial sector remains active. But without changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 21% of revenue.  Year-to-date, construction was 78% of our revenue, with 48% from construction projects for new buildings and 30% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service was particularly strong during the third quarter. Overall, service is 22% of our year-to-date revenue with service projects providing 9% of our revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 13% of revenue. Year-to-date service revenue is $674 million, a 33% increase with same-store service revenue up by 16%. Service continues to be a consistent and growing source of profit and cash flow at Comfort Systems.  In all our activities, including both service and construction, we are encouraging and supporting our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations. And we are raising our own standards in the areas of sustainability, diversity and governance.  Inflation is widespread, and we expect continued challenges in the cost and availability of the inputs that we use to serve our customers. Although conditions are hard to predict in the near term, we are recognizing these challenges in our job planning and pricing. And we are working to order materials earlier than usual, while seeking to collaborate with customers to share supply risk and to mitigate these challenges.  We have a very good pipeline of opportunities. And so far, we have been able to maintain activity levels and productivity despite supply chain challenges. We are watchful of world events and Fed tightening. However, given ongoing demand, our record backlog and strength in the industrial and institutional sectors, we anticipate continued strong earnings and cash flow in the coming quarters.  As we look ahead, our priority is to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry, so we can continue our legacy of safely constructing, installing, maintaining, repairing and replacing our nation's buildings, while helping our communities achieve sustainable growth.  With the highest backlog in the history of Comfort Systems USA, we will continue to invest in our workforce, technology and execution capabilities. Thanks to our amazing workforce, we are optimistic about the remainder of 2022 and 2023.  I want to end by thanking our 14,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Anthony for questions. Thank you. Yes. Julio, it's Brian. So it's -- we've got broad-based increase in backlog, to be honest. But for sure, we are getting increased bookings, and you'll see that continue into the fourth quarter. But the backlog increase, quite frankly, is broad-based. Yes. Well, I mean, we've had pretty consistent steady state growth in gross margins. I mean I think we have really terrific electrical companies. We had a challenging job a few years ago, they got helped by litigation pickup for sure, but we have improved significantly better across the board in electrical. And I'm pretty optimistic we'll continue to see improvement in the gross margins as we go forward. Yes. It's very robust. And we're even seeing our backlog extends -- it's for the highest number we've had longer than a year, Sean. So we've seen -- it's been the opposite. I think it's actually picked up, quite frankly. And equipment is one thing, you also got the labor, right? You got to make -- they want to make sure there are people to do it. Unprecedented. At least since -- in the 20 years I've been here, for sure. Yes. You can see it in the results, Sean. We are very fortunate here. At the operating company level, these folks have a really good handle on the markets they are playing in, in terms of all facets of the business. And we're very fortunate with the companies we have today. Sean, Bill keeps his track that he's had for the last 10 years, we'll be in good shape. I think we see a lot of opportunity, Adam, and just continuing to improve the mechanical electrical businesses that we're in. I think there's constant improvement, and it's pretty exciting. So we'll keep it that, I think. Well, I'm really happy with the margins that we're cranking out right now. We are 18.1%, as I said, probably a trillion times, you're 17.5%, 18%, above that, I think you're really performing well in the field. I think we're getting terrific productivity. I think we can maintain that level. You might get a little improvement as service continues to grow, right? We're getting some good margin help from there. But if we continue to perform in the field, that 18% range is definitely doable. And I think that's a really good number for us to be around. Well, absolutely, right? The goal of everything we do operationally is to improve, right, to improve our margins, to improve our productivity, improve our efficiency, quality, safety. So we're continuing to work on the electrical business. The companies are. We've had nice steady state improvement. We'll see -- you've got to do it, right? It's easy to talk about it.  But I think you will see continued improvement where we get to? I really don't know. But I'm pretty optimistic about the Electrical business margin improvement. But I think they can get there to be the same. I'm very optimistic about our electrical companies, Brent. All right. Thank you. In closing, I really want to thank again our tremendous workforce, and it's throughout the organization. We're getting tremendous performance from everybody, and I really appreciate it. We also really thank everybody for your interest in Comfort Systems and your time today. We are grateful for the questions and the interest for sure.

            "name": "William George",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and good morning. Revenue for the third quarter of 2022 was $1.12 billion, an increase of $286 million or 34% compared to last year. Our recent acquisitions contributed a total of $97 million of new quarterly revenue. And so we had same-store revenue growth of $198 million or about 23%. That sharp increase in revenue was broad-based and was driven by strong market conditions. Inflation of equipment and materials also contributed to revenue growth.  Our same-store revenue increased by 23% in the third quarter and same-store employee headcount increased by 8% in the same time frame. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect double-digit same-store revenue growth, although there are more variables than usual.  Gross profit was $202 million for the third quarter of 2022, a $43 million increase compared to last year and the first time we have ever reported over $200 million of gross profit in a single quarter. Our gross profit percentage was 18.1% this quarter compared to 19.1% for the third quarter of 2021. The decrease in gross profit percentage resulted from the change in project mix, including the pass-through of inflated materials and equipment costs.  Gross profit percentage was impacted by a decline in gross profit margins in our Mechanical segment compared to extraordinary performance last year, partially offset by a strong increase in the Electrical segment, which was further enhanced by a job-related litigation gain.  SG&A expense for the quarter was $121 million or 10.8% of revenue compared to $95 million or 11.4% of revenue for the third quarter of 2021. Most of the dollar increase is from new companies. Our operating income increased by 27% or $17 million as compared to the third quarter of 2021.  Our tax rate for the quarter was 17.4%. During the current quarter, we filed our 2021 federal tax return and we included the R&D tax credit in this original return. And as a result, we increased our estimated tax benefit related to the R&D tax credit for the current year, as well as for the years 2019 to 2021. And that was a gain of $0.04 for the third quarter of 2022 that related to prior years. We continue to view our normalized tax rate to be approximately 22% to 23%.  Net income for the third quarter of 2022 was $62 million or $1.71 per share. The $1.71 per share includes the 10% net gain related to legal matters and $0.04 related to the revised estimate for the R&D tax credit related to 2019 to 2021. Net income for the third quarter of 2021 was $46 million or $1.27 per share by comparison.  EBITDA increased from $82 million in the third quarter last year to $101 million this quarter, a 23% year-over-year EBITDA increase. As Brian pointed out, this is the first time in our history that we've achieved over $100 million of EBITDA in a single quarter.  Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2022 was $137 million, including the $33 million refund from the IRS tax credit in the first quarter. This is a strong cash flow considering the investments we're making in working capital as we fund our growth. Our debt at the end of September was $381 million and our debt-to-EBITDA ratio at quarter end stands at  We are actively repurchasing our shares. And in the first 9 months of 2022, we have repurchased 425,000 shares for approximately $36 million. So go ahead, Brian. Yes. So no, I would not say that's the baseline because, of course, we're charging more for those 8%, right? So there is inflation in that number. And also, our temporary labor is up quite a lot by more than 8%. So I think the best -- our best -- you can't know what would have happened without inflation, but our best estimate continues to be that about half of our same-store growth is caused by inflation and market conditions, and about half of our same-store growth is just us doing more work, true underlying growth.  And as far as the first part of your question about sort of the trend line, so we are still -- we had a reasonably soft comparables compared to a year ago, we were still coming out of COVID. The comparables get a little tougher in the fourth and first quarter, but there's still really favorable comparables if all you are looking for is same-store revenue growth. By the second quarter of next year, we'll be comping, and for the rest of next year, we'll be comping to these big numbers we're posting right now that are -- our second quarter was up 25%.  So a year from now, depending on what inflation is doing, it's much, much harder to prognosticate that you're going to grow from there. Even if we don't -- and by the way, if inflation abates, right, that could create at least some of sort of a turnaround in that effect. But I would say we don't think that would mean we would earn less money. In fact, if anything, it could be slightly favorable if prices were to get better.  So what you would see is you'd see lower revenue growth, but of course, the margins would get better because we'd have less of that material pass-through. So long question, but it's a complicated situation as well -- long answer, I'm sorry. And coincidentally, service was up by exactly the same percentage year-over-year as construction. So I think it's really -- it's all across the board that gain. But for sure, you'll probably see in the coming quarters, more of that coming from these industrial bookings because they're just so big. And also this third quarters are always strong service quarters. So definitely, there's more -- there's pull forward, right? I mean, because if they book earlier, they booked earlier than they would have been. Now does that mean they won't continue to book heavily? The question is, at some point, do they stop booking earlier because the lead times for equipment become less or because the market softens? And I think there's certainly no sign of that in what's actually happening in our business. Of course, we don't know that could change in a month or a year. But right now, I don't know, Brian, it's very robust. We have companies that aren't selling for 2023, they're full. And as you think about that, that's why people are committing earlier because we understand, oh, these guys are getting full. If we want a building, we better get. Unprecedented. Well, as you might imagine, if someone in one of the many, many cities we're working at is very busy. If you want them to do work, you're going to have to pay them well for it. So our -- you can see it in our numbers, right? It's certainly -- so we have 2 things going on in M&A. One is there are people we've just talked to for years, we're friends. And when they're ready to sell, we are there. We've worked on it for years, and we may -- you may see some M&A for sure. But in general, we do think that the market is changing, that the cost of capital has an effect on what people are willing to -- people are willing to invest capital, and that there are a lot of companies for sale right now. And I don't mean the company we usually buy. I mean, companies owned by private investors. There are -- I'd say there's 3x as many pitched booked on the street that I've ever seen.  So I think it's a moment of inflection, and I think we're going to be very, very careful. We've said forever, we don't have to do a deal in any given year, right? We just want to create value over a -- we play a very, very long game for this. So I know it's a bit of a mixed answer, but there's really 2 parts. And I would say we're going to be very, very, very watchful right now. I think it's because if you were somebody -- you were an investment firm for whom a business really is inventory, right? If you have a lot of inventory, you might not want to hold that inventory over the next year. So you might want to at least test the market. So I think that it's really astounding, quite honestly. Maybe I'm speaking out of school. But in general, everything is for sale. It's everything that it's owned by people who trade businesses seems to be for everything I know of is there at least testing the market.  Now do I think they're succeeding in selling these businesses? I wouldn't rule it out, but I don't know because we're not super active. We take a hard look at some of the really best stuff, not -- but in general, we don't participate in any of that. We like to get to know people over years, right? And that's not really how that works.  [indiscernible] things that other people have been assembling, right? We were very, very careful. We don't -- we really understand how hard that is and that how hard it is to put stuff together in ways that will last for decades, right? So we're very -- so far, we've never bought a company. We've never bought a contractor from anybody, but a human being who owned it and lives in it and loves it. Never done it. Well, there's not much need to for the foreseeable future. So it would have to be something we really felt like we had a reason to expect synergy from, right? And by the way, we did. We added a labor company. But in a way that matters to you that creates a new segment, I just, I think, we're just barely getting started with a... So Adam, there's a variable here that we don't know, which is, right now, our volumes are lower because of the pass-through are very -- in our cost of goods sold, materials and equipment are 3 points higher of that proportion, not 3% higher in total, but 3 points of the 100% higher of our cost, and that has that materials and equipment passes through at a lower margin. So I think what one of the things you could -- one way to look at it is we think the margins we're getting on our labor right now are stupendous and we would be very happy with them to stay the same forever. Behind that, there's some mix issues where if you made me pick, I'd expect our margins to be higher next year, but that's the assumption in that. The unknowable assumption is I'm assuming inflation gets under control. And I want to say, it's not that we're now expecting higher margins. We expected higher margins last year and the year before. We had a little bit of softness. But one of the interesting things you saw this quarter was we had a gain on a job-related -- a big job-related litigation in electrical. Well, essentially, what that was, was I was an arbitrator saying, oh, yes, they didn't barely compensate you for work you did in 2 years starting last year, really starting the year before.

And I think there is some upside in electrical margins.  Now having said that, keep in mind, the margin you're seeing, that 19%, has that gain from that -- so the margins, if you back out the gain from that litigation win, they're still a little below mechanical, but they're really, right, they're all kind of bunched together. And I think... Yes. I think there -- on the construction side, I think electrical is every bit as -- if not -- it's every bit as profitable. Yes. So we get -- if you look back at our last several years, we don't call it out separately, although you could find it in some places if you look carefully. We've gotten a few pennies from that, right? Here's what happens. With the 179D, the customer gets that unless it's like a public company, where it's a public -- I mean, sorry, a public entity.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Kate. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our comments today as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws and regulations. What we will say today is based upon the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we start, I want to sincerely thank our employees across the country working through so many tough challenges, including record heat and achieving amazing results for our customers. We had a strong second quarter. Thanks to careful planning and superb execution, our teams continue to perform for our customers and our stakeholders. We earned $1.17 per share this quarter compared to $0.90 a year ago. Unprecedented market conditions resulted in same-store revenue growth of approximately 25%, driven by increased activity in strong markets, combined with the effects of cost increases in materials, equipment and other inputs. New work is commencing across our footprint, and our backlog and pipeline remain strong. Cash flow was also excellent this quarter, especially since we are investing capital to support our growth. During the quarter, we also amended our credit facility to increase it to $850 million and improved flexibility and cost. We want to thank our banks for recognizing the strength of our balance sheet and providing us with this additional financial flexibility. I will discuss our business and outlook shortly. But first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nWilliam George: Thanks, Brian. It was quite a quarter for us, revenue, especially. Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $1.02 billion, an increase of $304 million or 43% compared to last year. This is the first time we've exceeded $1 billion in revenue for a quarter. Our recent acquisitions contributed a total of $128 million of new quarterly revenue and we had same-store revenue growth of $176 million. Our sharp increase in revenue was broad-based with a lot of new work starting, and we experienced inflation in equipment and materials and other inputs. As Brian mentioned, our same-store revenue increased by 25% in the second quarter, while our same-store employee headcount increased 10% in the same period. During the second quarter last year, our revenues were negatively impacted by the air pocket from COVID. Overall, for the remainder of the year, we currently expect double-digit same-store revenue growth probably in the range of 10% to 15%, although there are certainly more variables than usual. Gross profit was $175 million for the second quarter of 2022, a $49 million increase compared to a year ago. Same-store gross profit measured in dollars increased by 23%, very close to our same-store revenue increase. Our gross profit percentage was 17.2% this quarter compared to 17.7% for the second quarter of 2021. Our gross profit percentage in our Mechanical segment for the second quarter declined from 18.4% in 2021 to 17.8% in 2022, while the margins in the Electrical segment increased from 13.8% to 15.1% over the same period. The changes in gross profit percentage resulted from the evolution of our business mix as we're doing more new construction, we're early in many of our jobs and materials and equipment are a higher proportion of our cost of goods sold. SG&A expense for the quarter was $119 million or 11.7% of revenue compared to $88 million or 12.3% of revenue for the second quarter in 2021. Most of the dollar increases from new companies and on a same-store basis, SG&A was up moderately considering our growth by $13 million. Our operating income percentage increased slightly from 5.5% to 5.6%. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 21.1% and we continue to benefit as expected from the R&D tax credit that we finalized last quarter. After considering the above factors, net income for the second quarter of 2022 was $42 million, or $1.17 per share, that compares to net income for the second quarter of 2021 of $33 million or $0.90 per share. EBITDA increased from $55 million in the second quarter last year to $77 million this quarter, a remarkable 41% year-over-year EBITDA increase. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2022 was $90 million, including the $33 million refund from the IRS for the R&D tax credit that we got in the first quarter. This is good cash flow as we invest in growth. Our debt at the end of June was $406 million. As Brian mentioned, we increased our credit facility to $850 million. The new facility includes improved credit costs, greater capacity and even more favorable covenants. The amendment also adds flexibility with respect to acquisitions, dividends and stock buybacks. We are actively repurchasing our shares, in the first 6 months of 2022 we have repurchased 388,000 shares for approximately $33 million. And since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back 10.1 million shares at an average price of $24.12. And that's what I got in financial, Brad.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets, and I will comment on our outlook for the rest of 2022 and on inflation and supply chain considerations. Our backlog at the end of June was $2.81 billion. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog is up by $702 million or just over 38%, with increases across most of our operations with notable strength in Texas and North Carolina. Sequentially, our same-store backlog increased $52 million. Our industrial revenue was 46% of total revenue in the first half of 2022. This sector, which includes technology, life sciences and food processing remains strong and is heavily represented in new backlog and in our pipeline. Institutional markets, including education, health care and government are solid and represent 32% of our revenue, consistent with last year. Finally, the commercial sector is doing well. But without changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 22% of revenue. Year-to-date, construction was 78% of our revenue, with 48% from construction projects for new buildings and 30% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service is 22% of our year-to-date revenue with service projects providing 9% of our revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 13% of revenue. Year-to-date service revenue is up approximately 33%, including a same-store service revenue increase of 15%. Overall, service continues to be a consistent and growing source of profit and cash flow at Comfort Systems. In all our activities, including both service and construction, we are uniquely positioned to encourage and support our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations. And we are raising our own standards in the areas of sustainability, diversity and governance. Inflation is widespread. And in the coming months, we expect continued challenges in the cost and availability of the inputs that we use to serve our customers. Although conditions are hard to project in the near term, we are recognizing these challenges in our job planning and pricing. And we are working to order materials earlier than usual and seeking to collaborate with customers to share supply risks and to mitigate these challenges. We have a good pipeline of opportunities. And so far, we have been able to maintain activity levels and productivity despite supply chain challenges. We are watchful of world events and Fed tightening. However, giving ongoing demand, our record backlog and our focus in the industrial and institutional sectors, we anticipate continued strong earnings and cash flow in the coming quarters. This month marks 25 years in Comfort Systems USA was formed. As we look ahead, our priority is to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry, so we can continue our legacy of constructing, installing, maintaining, repairing and replacing our nation's building and in helping our communities achieve sustainable growth. We are optimistic about 2022 and beyond. With the highest backlog and the history of Comfort Systems USA, we will continue to invest in our workforce, technology, execution capabilities and in our service businesses. Our skilled workforce is the heart and soul of Comfort Systems USA. We are grateful for their dedication and we are committed to develop and reward our unmatched team members as they serve their communities. I want to end by thanking our 14,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Kate for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Julio Romero of Sidoti.\nJulio Romero: So I wanted to start on the top line. You mentioned for the remainder of the year, you expect same-store sales growth in the range of 10% to 15% for the remainder of the year. How much of that do you think is going to be increased activity versus cost pass-throughs?\nWilliam George: That's a really good question. One of the reasons I mentioned our same-store headcount increase in my prepared script was because to help people dimensionalize that. So in the second quarter, our revenue was up 25% same-store. Our same-store headcount was up about 10%. And we have a big group of temp workers at any given time, that was up by a little more than 10%. So my best estimate is that in the second -- we don't know what would have happened without all of the craziness with supply chain. But my best estimate is that about half of our growth, same-store 25% growth -- roughly half of that was just us doing more work, irrespective of inflation and the other half was driven by inflation. For the rest of the year, I don't have a better -- I don't have a better estimate than that. It's -- there's a lot of moving variables right now.\nJulio Romero: No, that's fair. And you called out the variables as well. So I mean -- so I guess how would you have us think about maybe gross profit percentage in the second half of the year?\nBrian Lane: Yes. So Julio, it's Brian. I'll give it for us and then Bill can follow on. So I mean if you look at where we are right today, we're really happy with our gross profit and the execution that we're getting on projects for sure. The good news for that is we're relatively still early in a lot of our jobs. So that was not really driven by any closeouts of pickups in particular. It's just good fundamental blocking and tackling that's driving that. So I think as we go through the rest of the year, I think service will maintain strength, particularly with the heat we're seeing throughout the country. We're really -- we're extremely busy. We're extremely busy in service. And I would anticipate that -- I don't know how many closeouts we get this year, but we will maintain our -- in the range we're currently in, I think, through the end of the year. Bill, anything?\nWilliam George: Yes. So we were 17.2%, a year ago, we were 17.7%. We think that range is good, the 17% to 18% range. We've been asking ourselves that, right? It's hard -- it's never been a harder time to predict that. Typically, our second half gross profits are higher than our first half gross profit. But typically, we're not -- we have a larger proportion of our jobs that are going to be getting to close out, more of those closeouts on the big jobs that are really driving us are slipping into next year. So I think the best guidance we can give to people is that same range, 17% to 18% -- and on these revenues, obviously, that kicks out a pretty good result.\nJulio Romero: Yes. No, that's helpful. And I guess just maybe last one for me is on the new revolver. Maybe any comments on the -- how the increased debt facility changes anything with regards to capital structure, uses of cash, et cetera?\nWilliam George: So it's nice to have a much -- it's all revolver. The flexibility that we obtained was extraordinary for things like if we chose to do big acquisitions or buybacks, we have really unprecedented flexibility to do that. Better pricing, so the pricing grid unambiguously came down, which it was already pretty low. The -- we've moved to a net leverage ratio as opposed to a total leverage ratio, which is much more -- we already -- we were already crushed -- our covenants were already very, very friendly, but we -- and we moved to an interest coverage ratio instead of a fixed charge ratio, both of which give us extremely good opportunity. I mean we're really, really easy to meet covenants given how we run our business. So I don't know, we're really thrilled. We think our timing was really good as well. We know a lot of our bankers are telling us all the clients are in there about to do a renewal. I think we just got lucky to do it right when we should have.\nOperator: Next question is from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: I guess, Brian or Bill, I guess, first question is just you touched on it a little bit, and it sounds like you're getting booked sort of further and further out, and I'm trying to conceptualize kind of the burn rate on this backlog right now. And the other element, I guess, that's in there is sort of the inflationary component to the dollars of backlog you report. I mean any help in terms of how you expect to kind of burn through this backlog with these large jobs you've got?\nBrian Lane: Yes. So I think our burn rate is going to be pretty typical. Our average size is still roughly 777,000. So we'll be a large chunk of it in the next 6 to 9 months as usual -- probably about 2/3 to 70% or so. But we are obviously winning work out to 2023 with some of these larger opportunities. So I think the pace that we're burning it is good, and it's -- it's a good mix for the labor and the size of our operating companies that have the work. So I think at this point, we're really happy with the burn rate as we've got it forecasted still.\nWilliam George: Right. And our backlog is going to be very big at a moment when we're on average early in jobs, right? Because that means there's more on average work left to do than usual for the number of jobs we have, right? So we keep saying that our WIP schedules are gone. That's 1 of the reasons why we're pretty comfortable that we have the manpower to do this work. It's a pretty eye-popping -- it's pretty eye-popping increase in same-store backlog. But there are things that are making that accentuating that backlog currently. The other big thing that accentuated the size of the backlog since it's measured in dollars is the inflation. So when our guys in the field are looking at backlog, what they're looking at is their workers, their manpower, essentially, their timing and I think they think they've got it exactly right, and we'll see. They've got a pretty good track record.\nBrent Thielman: Maybe to follow up on that. I mean, how do you -- you're booking $1 billion plus a quarter here, it sounds like your markets are still really strong. I mean how do you think about how backlog sort of evolve as we move through the rest of the year?\nBrian Lane: Well, I think if you look at how much we're burning right now, I think the backlog will probably stay pretty steady, knowing how many opportunities are out there. I don't think we'll see an increase in it. We're burning, as you can tell, at extremely high rate. I booked the burns over 1 for the quarter and I think we'll hold that, Brent, at least for the next couple of quarters.\nWilliam George: We don't know when it will happen, but there'll be a moment when material and -- material costs moderate at some level, I believe. And obviously, that will moderate the dollar amount of our backlog. But we think -- and we think the demand for our labor is foreseeably very, very -- really very, very robust, honestly. As far as backlog is dollar-denominated. So when you're predicting it, there are variables in there that don't really matter for how much money they make -- that we make, but they do matter if we like sort of what our revenue -- how much revenue we do. What we try to focus on is gross profit per hour of work, right?\nBrian Lane: And just to follow on that Brent, the type of work we're winning is the type of work we're good at. So it's really in our wheelhouse. So obviously, the guys are doing a great job managing it and executing it.\nBrent Thielman: Yes, absolutely. Maybe just one more for me. The mechanical margins just quarter-over-quarter, I guess I would have typically thought they'd pick up from the first quarter to the second quarter. It looks like that did happen in Electrical. But I guess any other color around that in terms of the quarter-over-quarter decline?\nWilliam George: So there were not meaningful job phase. Essentially what you had with I think people are dealing with higher cost materials and I think people are -- I know really, people are being very, very careful with how they recognize profit right now. They're really making sure that they've got the money in they need for all of the variables that are out there. And I don't know it's perfectly helpful. The question is, is mechanical healthy? Very, very healthy. I will also say the shift in job size and the new work is bigger in mechanical than it is in electrical. Because mechanical -- our electrical division already had really a much higher proportion of their work was already what we're shifting to as a company. So there's less of a shift for them. So some of that as always, some of that mix. I'm sorry if that's not too...\nBrian Lane: And on the electrical front, Brent, we really had a good steady-state improvement I mean the companies that have joined us are really strong, and the work they have is work they're good at. As Bill said, it tends to be bigger. And they're just doing a really good job of doing it right now.\nWilliam George: I would say -- there was a lot of new construction and we became -- started being worked on in Mechanical this quarter, look at our -- that's where we look at our revenue, right? Revenue up 25% is not because we ran an extra service cost.\nOperator: The next question is from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc.\nSean Eastman: Great update here. I just wanted to round out the margin discussion. We got some good color on gross margin. But obviously, the SG&A leverage in the second quarter was quite notable. I just wondered how to think about that on the 10% to 15% organic growth in the second half. And maybe to try and push you guys a little harder. I mean is flat operating margin potentially in the range of expectations for the full year. Any thoughts around those last few pieces of the puzzle there would be helpful.\nWilliam George: So SG&A went from 12.3% of revenue to probably an all-time low at 11.7% of revenue. You can see we had fantastic absorption of [indiscernible] on these jobs. I have really no reason to think that won't continue. I don't think it gets a lot better because like we said, we have tougher comparables. A year ago, we had higher revenue in the second and third -- the third quarter and fourth quarter because we were coming out of -- started to come out of COVID, so we had more comparable absorption. But I think -- my best guess, if I'm being honest, is that 11.7% is probably a good number. We'll keep the absorption we've got. It's hard to see how we get much more comparables are turning a little harder for us on the revenue side and you got to pay people.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Great. Great. And just in terms of the updated message on the supply chain challenges, I mean, clearly persisting in terms of operating conditions. But just after experiencing some of the busier summer months, are you feeling better or worse about Comfort Systems' ability to manage through that sort of unscathed?\nBrian Lane: Well, I mean I think right now, the folks that are running this work are doing a tremendous job managing the supply chain, Sean, as you know, we've talked about, it's a day-to-day event. And if you just get a little bit more specific, if you talk about [indiscernible] and fittings, we're seeing stability there in terms of pricing and availability, the stuff that's challenged is something that has an electronic chip in it like a vehicle, a big equipment. But this is a day-to-day management process. It really hasn't slowed us down in a meaningful way anywhere. But we don't -- there's no secret sauce here. It's staying close to your vendors, customers being transparent and getting ahead of it as best we can.\nSean Eastman: Got it. Okay. And then on the industrial segment, this has been a great growth story for a number of years now. How would you characterize just in your discussions with the customer base there, how sensitive those capital programs are going to be around the broader macro? And has that industrial growth story evolved at all? I mean, we've been talking about data centers for a while, pharma, food, but now we're hearing more about battery and semiconductors. I mean, is there sort of any evolution that you're seeing come through as we just think about the next couple of years around this story?\nWilliam George: So those types of customers, they don't worry about -- they don't have financing problems, right? They got all you need -- so the question is, do they have the confidence to build? And generally speaking, I think there's a really, really good reason to think the stuff that they're building is going to be needed. Obviously, battery and semiconductors, right? But even data. I mean there is -- unless -- so far, could it happen? I guess it could. So far, there's no turnaway from data. There's no turnaway from catching up on the food processing side, pet food is strong. So far, if it's going to -- if some is going to turn it, we can't -- it hasn't happened yet.\nBrian Lane: And there's no indications we're still seeing a lot of very early us participating in these opportunities, Sean. So -- as far as we know right now, there is no let up.\nWilliam George: The pharma hasn't even really kicked in. The battery hasn't really even kicked in yet. There's upside in hospital. So even if there's weakness in some other areas, you can really -- you can look and see where other things that get you feel pretty good about.\nBrian Lane: And add on to that, we're seeing good strength in education. Our backlog is up in education. So we're still seeing very good opportunities at the university level as well in addition to the others you mentioned.\nSean Eastman: And then, of course, service continues to chug along with healthy growth. So maybe the is a lot of optionality around the growth profile on a go forward?\nWilliam George: And modular is booking up pretty nice, too.\nOperator: Next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great quarter. Bill, can I just keep going there on the modular? What percentage of revenue is modular now? And what's the growth outlook? What growth are you seeing there?\nWilliam George: It won't be far off the 10%. I don't think I've seen that yet. But I will say that's astounding because think how much the rest of it went up, right? It's keeping pace. Right now at Comfort, how big you are as a part of Comfort is a matter of how fast you can grow because everybody else is -- every other way, you can look at the business is growing so fast that you can grow by 10% and shrink as a proportion of revenue. So -- and they're keeping paid. And there's really, really good orders coming out of tech. There's some stuff in the bio space. These guys, we've added square footage. So in the modular space, both in North Carolina and Tennessee, we've added capacity. We're actively adding capacity as we speak. So they're keeping pace, and that's pretty amazing.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. The 10% to 15% organic revenue growth in the back half of this year, what's your best guess on what that moderates do next year?\nWilliam George: You're going to have to tell me what's going to happen with inflation, but let's assume inflation flattens out, my guess is it moderates to -- it moderates to mid-single digits because honestly, our -- we can only grow our workforce so fast, right? Now by the way, if prices start to come down, prices -- and I don't mean drop -- the floor drops out, but China is not buying as much stuff. There are reasons to think the supply chain doesn't keep gummed up forever, especially for certain very important cost items. You'll see backlog come down. You'll see revenue come down. But of course, then we'll look like margin geniuses, right? We're never -- we don't really care about revenue. We care about how much money we make, and we think we can make a lot of money as far as we can tell.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great. Last one for me. I was trying to model electrical revenue? Because you had $241 million in Q2, which is a really strong number, had to be a record. I guess I had the acquisition there, too. But that $241 million, where does that go to in the back half?\nWilliam George: If you figure that out, let me know. So here's what we have going on. We've owned a gigantic wonderful dynamic company in Texas for a few years. And at first, they shrunk a little. They have become more profitable. They're back to really serious growth, very profitable growth. But we bought some more electrical and sometimes when we buy a company, there's a period of time when they -- historically, if you look at like our seventh biggest acquisition to the last seven or eight years, five of the seven shrunk a little bit in the first year or two. All of them are bigger than the day we bought them by a lot today with higher profit margins. So we've got 2 things going on. We got one big company coming on strong [indiscernible], so there's a really interesting mix right now. Electrical is new for us. It's hard to predict. But I'd take the over.\nBrian Lane: We're going to get growth [indiscernible].\nWilliam George: A company that's growing is going to win. And I'll take the over, but it's really hard to make out. There's a lot of things that could happen. But I'd tell you what will happen unless [indiscernible] the new higher margins are good.\nBrian Lane: And we're really focused on that and improving margin in the electrical business, Adam. So far, we've been steady as she goes, but hopefully, we'll keep doing that.\nWilliam George: I'd be more comfortable predicting good to somewhat improving electrical margins than I would predicting their revenue. It's hard to predict their revenue. Their margins are well positioned.\nBrian Lane: Yes.\nAdam Thalhimer: You think you get to parity at some point?\nWilliam George: I think on the construction business, we are at parity. We're pretty much there. If you take size of jobs, the size of jobs and whatever. For electrical to have -- for electrical taken as a whole to have parity with mechanical taken as a whole, electrical got to be doing better because the mechanical has more service. But keep in mind, on the operating income line, I think we're at parity. Their SG&A is notably less because that service business has salesmen and commissions, thousands of transactions and billing departments and [indiscernible] factors, you know what I mean.\nBrian Lane: And our mechanical service will always be bigger than electrical service.\nWilliam George: Yes, because just moving parts -- moving parts were out, right? So I don't know that that's even -- I hope not because here's what I hope. I hope electrical gets to where mechanical is today, but mechanical has gone further out on the gross profit side.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then how does the accounting work? Are you pulling less profit from the mechanical -- like your large mechanical jobs just because they're so early and you have supply chain concerns?\nWilliam George: Accounting question, I'm going to leave it for Brian. No. So a bigger job-- really any job early on, what happens is you bid a job at a certain gross margins. You have a handover meeting where the guys who are going to perform the job, take ownership of the job and what the costs are. They load the job at a margin that everybody agrees is a reasonable margin to start it at -- but when they do that, they leave contingency in the job early on because you straight up don't know how much it's going to rain. You don't know whether the drywall guy is going to be there, whether when you need -- when you're ready to go, will other people be ready to go. There's many things you can't control. So early in a job, you carry more contingency. Therefore, the job -- on average, for comfort, since the beginning with no exceptions in our whole history, on average, jobs have lower margins at the beginning and we have, on average, gain over the course of the year. We've never had a year where we didn't have net gain across our jobs. And right now, as you might imagine, people are undoubtedly being more careful than usual. But there's a reason they're being more careful. They don't know about their supply chain. Labor is tight. So the answer is yes. We carry jobs at a more -- I think we carry jobs carefully early on because if you don't, you only have to go out of business once and then you're gone. A good -- we've never bought a construction company that didn't have a net pickup in their jobs because anybody who didn't have that would have a year when they went out of business. So it's a very long answer, but of course, yes.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then when do the -- but the large jobs because you talked about starting a lot of large jobs in Q2, when do those get to the later stages?\nBrian Lane: I think some will be a fourth quarter this year, but mostly you'll see, I think, in the first early second quarter.\nWilliam George: Really throughout next year. Throughout next year. We'll get back to a normal mix of closeouts and younger work.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks and closing, I really want to thank all our diligent employees again. We really appreciate all the hard work you do. I want to thank everyone for joining the call this morning. As you can tell, we are very excited about our opportunities, and we are optimistic both the second half of this year and beyond. I hope everybody enjoys the rest of their summer. Thank you.\nWilliam George: Yes. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Before we start, I want to sincerely thank our employees across the country working through so many tough challenges, including record heat and achieving amazing results for our customers. We had a strong second quarter. Thanks to careful planning and superb execution, our teams continue to perform for our customers and our stakeholders. We earned $1.17 per share this quarter compared to $0.90 a year ago. Unprecedented market conditions resulted in same-store revenue growth of approximately 25%, driven by increased activity in strong markets, combined with the effects of cost increases in materials, equipment and other inputs. New work is commencing across our footprint, and our backlog and pipeline remain strong. Cash flow was also excellent this quarter, especially since we are investing capital to support our growth. During the quarter, we also amended our credit facility to increase it to $850 million and improved flexibility and cost. We want to thank our banks for recognizing the strength of our balance sheet and providing us with this additional financial flexibility. I will discuss our business and outlook shortly. But first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? All right. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets, and I will comment on our outlook for the rest of 2022 and on inflation and supply chain considerations. Our backlog at the end of June was $2.81 billion. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog is up by $702 million or just over 38%, with increases across most of our operations with notable strength in Texas and North Carolina. Sequentially, our same-store backlog increased $52 million. Our industrial revenue was 46% of total revenue in the first half of 2022. This sector, which includes technology, life sciences and food processing remains strong and is heavily represented in new backlog and in our pipeline. Institutional markets, including education, health care and government are solid and represent 32% of our revenue, consistent with last year. Finally, the commercial sector is doing well. But without changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 22% of revenue. Year-to-date, construction was 78% of our revenue, with 48% from construction projects for new buildings and 30% from construction projects in existing buildings. Service is 22% of our year-to-date revenue with service projects providing 9% of our revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 13% of revenue. Year-to-date service revenue is up approximately 33%, including a same-store service revenue increase of 15%. Overall, service continues to be a consistent and growing source of profit and cash flow at Comfort Systems. In all our activities, including both service and construction, we are uniquely positioned to encourage and support our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations. And we are raising our own standards in the areas of sustainability, diversity and governance. Inflation is widespread. And in the coming months, we expect continued challenges in the cost and availability of the inputs that we use to serve our customers. Although conditions are hard to project in the near term, we are recognizing these challenges in our job planning and pricing. And we are working to order materials earlier than usual and seeking to collaborate with customers to share supply risks and to mitigate these challenges. We have a good pipeline of opportunities. And so far, we have been able to maintain activity levels and productivity despite supply chain challenges. We are watchful of world events and Fed tightening. However, giving ongoing demand, our record backlog and our focus in the industrial and institutional sectors, we anticipate continued strong earnings and cash flow in the coming quarters. This month marks 25 years in Comfort Systems USA was formed. As we look ahead, our priority is to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry, so we can continue our legacy of constructing, installing, maintaining, repairing and replacing our nation's building and in helping our communities achieve sustainable growth. We are optimistic about 2022 and beyond. With the highest backlog and the history of Comfort Systems USA, we will continue to invest in our workforce, technology, execution capabilities and in our service businesses. Our skilled workforce is the heart and soul of Comfort Systems USA. We are grateful for their dedication and we are committed to develop and reward our unmatched team members as they serve their communities. I want to end by thanking our 14,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Kate for questions. Thank you. Yes. So Julio, it's Brian. I'll give it for us and then Bill can follow on. So I mean if you look at where we are right today, we're really happy with our gross profit and the execution that we're getting on projects for sure. The good news for that is we're relatively still early in a lot of our jobs. So that was not really driven by any closeouts of pickups in particular. It's just good fundamental blocking and tackling that's driving that. So I think as we go through the rest of the year, I think service will maintain strength, particularly with the heat we're seeing throughout the country. We're really -- we're extremely busy. We're extremely busy in service. And I would anticipate that -- I don't know how many closeouts we get this year, but we will maintain our -- in the range we're currently in, I think, through the end of the year. Bill, anything? Yes. So I think our burn rate is going to be pretty typical. Our average size is still roughly 777,000. So we'll be a large chunk of it in the next 6 to 9 months as usual -- probably about 2/3 to 70% or so. But we are obviously winning work out to 2023 with some of these larger opportunities. So I think the pace that we're burning it is good, and it's -- it's a good mix for the labor and the size of our operating companies that have the work. So I think at this point, we're really happy with the burn rate as we've got it forecasted still. Well, I think if you look at how much we're burning right now, I think the backlog will probably stay pretty steady, knowing how many opportunities are out there. I don't think we'll see an increase in it. We're burning, as you can tell, at extremely high rate. I booked the burns over 1 for the quarter and I think we'll hold that, Brent, at least for the next couple of quarters. And just to follow on that Brent, the type of work we're winning is the type of work we're good at. So it's really in our wheelhouse. So obviously, the guys are doing a great job managing it and executing it. And on the electrical front, Brent, we really had a good steady-state improvement I mean the companies that have joined us are really strong, and the work they have is work they're good at. As Bill said, it tends to be bigger. And they're just doing a really good job of doing it right now. Well, I mean I think right now, the folks that are running this work are doing a tremendous job managing the supply chain, Sean, as you know, we've talked about, it's a day-to-day event. And if you just get a little bit more specific, if you talk about [indiscernible] and fittings, we're seeing stability there in terms of pricing and availability, the stuff that's challenged is something that has an electronic chip in it like a vehicle, a big equipment. But this is a day-to-day management process. It really hasn't slowed us down in a meaningful way anywhere. But we don't -- there's no secret sauce here. It's staying close to your vendors, customers being transparent and getting ahead of it as best we can. And there's no indications we're still seeing a lot of very early us participating in these opportunities, Sean. So -- as far as we know right now, there is no let up. And add on to that, we're seeing good strength in education. Our backlog is up in education. So we're still seeing very good opportunities at the university level as well in addition to the others you mentioned. We're going to get growth [indiscernible]. And we're really focused on that and improving margin in the electrical business, Adam. So far, we've been steady as she goes, but hopefully, we'll keep doing that. Yes. And our mechanical service will always be bigger than electrical service. I think some will be a fourth quarter this year, but mostly you'll see, I think, in the first early second quarter. Okay. Thanks and closing, I really want to thank all our diligent employees again. We really appreciate all the hard work you do. I want to thank everyone for joining the call this morning. As you can tell, we are very excited about our opportunities, and we are optimistic both the second half of this year and beyond. I hope everybody enjoys the rest of their summer. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. It was quite a quarter for us, revenue, especially. Revenue for the second quarter of 2022 was $1.02 billion, an increase of $304 million or 43% compared to last year. This is the first time we've exceeded $1 billion in revenue for a quarter. Our recent acquisitions contributed a total of $128 million of new quarterly revenue and we had same-store revenue growth of $176 million. Our sharp increase in revenue was broad-based with a lot of new work starting, and we experienced inflation in equipment and materials and other inputs. As Brian mentioned, our same-store revenue increased by 25% in the second quarter, while our same-store employee headcount increased 10% in the same period. During the second quarter last year, our revenues were negatively impacted by the air pocket from COVID. Overall, for the remainder of the year, we currently expect double-digit same-store revenue growth probably in the range of 10% to 15%, although there are certainly more variables than usual. Gross profit was $175 million for the second quarter of 2022, a $49 million increase compared to a year ago. Same-store gross profit measured in dollars increased by 23%, very close to our same-store revenue increase. Our gross profit percentage was 17.2% this quarter compared to 17.7% for the second quarter of 2021. Our gross profit percentage in our Mechanical segment for the second quarter declined from 18.4% in 2021 to 17.8% in 2022, while the margins in the Electrical segment increased from 13.8% to 15.1% over the same period. The changes in gross profit percentage resulted from the evolution of our business mix as we're doing more new construction, we're early in many of our jobs and materials and equipment are a higher proportion of our cost of goods sold. SG&A expense for the quarter was $119 million or 11.7% of revenue compared to $88 million or 12.3% of revenue for the second quarter in 2021. Most of the dollar increases from new companies and on a same-store basis, SG&A was up moderately considering our growth by $13 million. Our operating income percentage increased slightly from 5.5% to 5.6%. Our tax rate for the second quarter was 21.1% and we continue to benefit as expected from the R&D tax credit that we finalized last quarter. After considering the above factors, net income for the second quarter of 2022 was $42 million, or $1.17 per share, that compares to net income for the second quarter of 2021 of $33 million or $0.90 per share. EBITDA increased from $55 million in the second quarter last year to $77 million this quarter, a remarkable 41% year-over-year EBITDA increase. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2022 was $90 million, including the $33 million refund from the IRS for the R&D tax credit that we got in the first quarter. This is good cash flow as we invest in growth. Our debt at the end of June was $406 million. As Brian mentioned, we increased our credit facility to $850 million. The new facility includes improved credit costs, greater capacity and even more favorable covenants. The amendment also adds flexibility with respect to acquisitions, dividends and stock buybacks. We are actively repurchasing our shares, in the first 6 months of 2022 we have repurchased 388,000 shares for approximately $33 million. And since we began our repurchase program in 2007, we have bought back 10.1 million shares at an average price of $24.12. And that's what I got in financial, Brad. That's a really good question. One of the reasons I mentioned our same-store headcount increase in my prepared script was because to help people dimensionalize that. So in the second quarter, our revenue was up 25% same-store. Our same-store headcount was up about 10%. And we have a big group of temp workers at any given time, that was up by a little more than 10%. So my best estimate is that in the second -- we don't know what would have happened without all of the craziness with supply chain. But my best estimate is that about half of our growth, same-store 25% growth -- roughly half of that was just us doing more work, irrespective of inflation and the other half was driven by inflation. For the rest of the year, I don't have a better -- I don't have a better estimate than that. It's -- there's a lot of moving variables right now. Yes. So we were 17.2%, a year ago, we were 17.7%. We think that range is good, the 17% to 18% range. We've been asking ourselves that, right? It's hard -- it's never been a harder time to predict that. Typically, our second half gross profits are higher than our first half gross profit. But typically, we're not -- we have a larger proportion of our jobs that are going to be getting to close out, more of those closeouts on the big jobs that are really driving us are slipping into next year. So I think the best guidance we can give to people is that same range, 17% to 18% -- and on these revenues, obviously, that kicks out a pretty good result. So it's nice to have a much -- it's all revolver. The flexibility that we obtained was extraordinary for things like if we chose to do big acquisitions or buybacks, we have really unprecedented flexibility to do that. Better pricing, so the pricing grid unambiguously came down, which it was already pretty low. The -- we've moved to a net leverage ratio as opposed to a total leverage ratio, which is much more -- we already -- we were already crushed -- our covenants were already very, very friendly, but we -- and we moved to an interest coverage ratio instead of a fixed charge ratio, both of which give us extremely good opportunity. I mean we're really, really easy to meet covenants given how we run our business. So I don't know, we're really thrilled. We think our timing was really good as well. We know a lot of our bankers are telling us all the clients are in there about to do a renewal. I think we just got lucky to do it right when we should have. Right. And our backlog is going to be very big at a moment when we're on average early in jobs, right? Because that means there's more on average work left to do than usual for the number of jobs we have, right? So we keep saying that our WIP schedules are gone. That's 1 of the reasons why we're pretty comfortable that we have the manpower to do this work. It's a pretty eye-popping -- it's pretty eye-popping increase in same-store backlog. But there are things that are making that accentuating that backlog currently. The other big thing that accentuated the size of the backlog since it's measured in dollars is the inflation. So when our guys in the field are looking at backlog, what they're looking at is their workers, their manpower, essentially, their timing and I think they think they've got it exactly right, and we'll see. They've got a pretty good track record. We don't know when it will happen, but there'll be a moment when material and -- material costs moderate at some level, I believe. And obviously, that will moderate the dollar amount of our backlog. But we think -- and we think the demand for our labor is foreseeably very, very -- really very, very robust, honestly. As far as backlog is dollar-denominated. So when you're predicting it, there are variables in there that don't really matter for how much money they make -- that we make, but they do matter if we like sort of what our revenue -- how much revenue we do. What we try to focus on is gross profit per hour of work, right? So there were not meaningful job phase. Essentially what you had with I think people are dealing with higher cost materials and I think people are -- I know really, people are being very, very careful with how they recognize profit right now. They're really making sure that they've got the money in they need for all of the variables that are out there. And I don't know it's perfectly helpful. The question is, is mechanical healthy? Very, very healthy. I will also say the shift in job size and the new work is bigger in mechanical than it is in electrical. Because mechanical -- our electrical division already had really a much higher proportion of their work was already what we're shifting to as a company. So there's less of a shift for them. So some of that as always, some of that mix. I'm sorry if that's not too... I would say -- there was a lot of new construction and we became -- started being worked on in Mechanical this quarter, look at our -- that's where we look at our revenue, right? Revenue up 25% is not because we ran an extra service cost. So SG&A went from 12.3% of revenue to probably an all-time low at 11.7% of revenue. You can see we had fantastic absorption of [indiscernible] on these jobs. I have really no reason to think that won't continue. I don't think it gets a lot better because like we said, we have tougher comparables. A year ago, we had higher revenue in the second and third -- the third quarter and fourth quarter because we were coming out of -- started to come out of COVID, so we had more comparable absorption. But I think -- my best guess, if I'm being honest, is that 11.7% is probably a good number. We'll keep the absorption we've got. It's hard to see how we get much more comparables are turning a little harder for us on the revenue side and you got to pay people. So those types of customers, they don't worry about -- they don't have financing problems, right? They got all you need -- so the question is, do they have the confidence to build? And generally speaking, I think there's a really, really good reason to think the stuff that they're building is going to be needed. Obviously, battery and semiconductors, right? But even data. I mean there is -- unless -- so far, could it happen? I guess it could. So far, there's no turnaway from data. There's no turnaway from catching up on the food processing side, pet food is strong. So far, if it's going to -- if some is going to turn it, we can't -- it hasn't happened yet. The pharma hasn't even really kicked in. The battery hasn't really even kicked in yet. There's upside in hospital. So even if there's weakness in some other areas, you can really -- you can look and see where other things that get you feel pretty good about. And modular is booking up pretty nice, too. It won't be far off the 10%. I don't think I've seen that yet. But I will say that's astounding because think how much the rest of it went up, right? It's keeping pace. Right now at Comfort, how big you are as a part of Comfort is a matter of how fast you can grow because everybody else is -- every other way, you can look at the business is growing so fast that you can grow by 10% and shrink as a proportion of revenue. So -- and they're keeping paid. And there's really, really good orders coming out of tech. There's some stuff in the bio space. These guys, we've added square footage. So in the modular space, both in North Carolina and Tennessee, we've added capacity. We're actively adding capacity as we speak. So they're keeping pace, and that's pretty amazing. You're going to have to tell me what's going to happen with inflation, but let's assume inflation flattens out, my guess is it moderates to -- it moderates to mid-single digits because honestly, our -- we can only grow our workforce so fast, right? Now by the way, if prices start to come down, prices -- and I don't mean drop -- the floor drops out, but China is not buying as much stuff. There are reasons to think the supply chain doesn't keep gummed up forever, especially for certain very important cost items. You'll see backlog come down. You'll see revenue come down. But of course, then we'll look like margin geniuses, right? We're never -- we don't really care about revenue. We care about how much money we make, and we think we can make a lot of money as far as we can tell. If you figure that out, let me know. So here's what we have going on. We've owned a gigantic wonderful dynamic company in Texas for a few years. And at first, they shrunk a little. They have become more profitable. They're back to really serious growth, very profitable growth. But we bought some more electrical and sometimes when we buy a company, there's a period of time when they -- historically, if you look at like our seventh biggest acquisition to the last seven or eight years, five of the seven shrunk a little bit in the first year or two. All of them are bigger than the day we bought them by a lot today with higher profit margins. So we've got 2 things going on. We got one big company coming on strong [indiscernible], so there's a really interesting mix right now. Electrical is new for us. It's hard to predict. But I'd take the over. A company that's growing is going to win. And I'll take the over, but it's really hard to make out. There's a lot of things that could happen. But I'd tell you what will happen unless [indiscernible] the new higher margins are good. I'd be more comfortable predicting good to somewhat improving electrical margins than I would predicting their revenue. It's hard to predict their revenue. Their margins are well positioned. I think on the construction business, we are at parity. We're pretty much there. If you take size of jobs, the size of jobs and whatever. For electrical to have -- for electrical taken as a whole to have parity with mechanical taken as a whole, electrical got to be doing better because the mechanical has more service. But keep in mind, on the operating income line, I think we're at parity. Their SG&A is notably less because that service business has salesmen and commissions, thousands of transactions and billing departments and [indiscernible] factors, you know what I mean. Yes, because just moving parts -- moving parts were out, right? So I don't know that that's even -- I hope not because here's what I hope. I hope electrical gets to where mechanical is today, but mechanical has gone further out on the gross profit side. Accounting question, I'm going to leave it for Brian. No. So a bigger job-- really any job early on, what happens is you bid a job at a certain gross margins. You have a handover meeting where the guys who are going to perform the job, take ownership of the job and what the costs are. They load the job at a margin that everybody agrees is a reasonable margin to start it at -- but when they do that, they leave contingency in the job early on because you straight up don't know how much it's going to rain. You don't know whether the drywall guy is going to be there, whether when you need -- when you're ready to go, will other people be ready to go. There's many things you can't control. So early in a job, you carry more contingency. Therefore, the job -- on average, for comfort, since the beginning with no exceptions in our whole history, on average, jobs have lower margins at the beginning and we have, on average, gain over the course of the year. We've never had a year where we didn't have net gain across our jobs. And right now, as you might imagine, people are undoubtedly being more careful than usual. But there's a reason they're being more careful. They don't know about their supply chain. Labor is tight. So the answer is yes. We carry jobs at a more -- I think we carry jobs carefully early on because if you don't, you only have to go out of business once and then you're gone. A good -- we've never bought a construction company that didn't have a net pickup in their jobs because anybody who didn't have that would have a year when they went out of business. So it's a very long answer, but of course, yes. Really throughout next year. Throughout next year. We'll get back to a normal mix of closeouts and younger work. Yes. Thanks, everybody."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Justin. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's first quarter 2022 earnings call.  Our comments today as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws and regulations. What we will say today is based upon the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release covering these earnings.  A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website, found at comfortsystemsusa.com.  Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to report a fantastic start to 2022. Our teams are busier than ever, and we are incredibly grateful for their hard work and we thank them.  Excluding the tax gains that Bill will discuss in a few minutes, we earned $0.91 per share this quarter compared to $0.73 a year ago. New work is commencing across all markets and our same-store revenue increased by 16% compared to a year ago. Bookings climbed again, as demand is strong for our services. We had good cash flow, despite deploying working capital to support our growth. Yesterday, we also announced a $0.01 increase to our quarterly dividend.  On April 1, we acquired Atlantic Electric headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina. Atlantic performs electrical contracting in various South Carolina markets, as well as specialized work on airfields in the southeast. This partnership brings new capabilities and new markets to Comfort Systems USA.  I will discuss our business outlook shortly, but first I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nWilliam George: Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. I've been doing this call since 2005 and this is the first time I've ever started with tax. And I'm very happy it's for a good reason. The reason I'm going to start with taxes this morning is because our recent tax events affect so many of our numbers.  So, as previously discussed, in January, the Joint Committee on Taxation approved our previously filed refund claims for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax years, primarily to claim the credit for increasing research activities or the R&D tax credit.  Up to the end of last year, we had not recorded any benefit for those refund claims. So this approval in the current quarter triggered recognition of a $30 million benefit for the 2016 to 2018 tax year.  Because these credits were approved for past years, we also reevaluated the realizability judgments that we have made with regards to the R&D tax credit for the intervening years of 2019, 2020 and 2021. And as a result, we recorded a $27 million non-cash for now, tax benefit for those years. After subtracting SG&A expenses related to those tax credits, the net result of those gains was an additional $1.49 in earnings per share this quarter.  Consequently, our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 is a negative 130%. Additionally, when we evaluated our taxes for the first quarter of this year, we also included consideration of the R&D tax credit, and that lowered our tax rate for the quarter. Excluding the prior year benefit, our tax rate for the first quarter was 22% and we expect our ongoing normalized rate will be similar in the future.  So, with that background, I'll now discuss our remaining performance. Revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $885 million, an increase of $215 million or 32% compared to last year. Same-store revenue increased by 16%, a broad-based increase that results from strong conditions with a lot of new work starting, as well as the fact that last year we had air pockets relating to COVID.  Overall, for the remainder of the year, we currently expect high-single digit or low-double digit same-store revenue growth.  Gross profit was $153 million for the first quarter of 2022, a $30 million increase compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage was 17.3% this quarter compared to 18.4% for the first quarter of 2021. Our gross profit percentage in our mechanical segment declined from 19.1% in 2021 to 18.6% in 2022. And margins in the electrical segment also decreased from 14.7% to 13% over the same period.  The decreases in gross profit percentage resulted from several factors. First, new construction is up significantly as a proportion of our revenue. Second, much of our revenue is on jobs that are early in their lifecycle when we generally report lower margins due to uncertainty. Third, with the concerns surrounding supply chain and labor, we are naturally being cautious about cost trends when we estimate the cost to complete ongoing work. Finally, and importantly, materials and equipment are trending higher as a proportion of our costs due to price increases. Material and equipment costs this quarter were 40% of our cost of goods sold as compared to 34% of our costs in the quarter one year ago.  Since we put more markup on labor than we do on materials, higher proportion of material and equipment in our cost of goods sold lowers our overall margin even as our gross profit per labor hour stays strong.  SG&A expense for the quarter was $118 million or 13.3% of revenue compared to $88 million or 13.2% of revenue for the first quarter of 2021. We did several acquisitions in the second half of 2021, so most of the dollar increase is in new companies.  On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $13 million. However, $4.5 million of that increase relates to tax consulting fees and other expenses related to the prior-year R&D tax credits that were recorded this quarter. Excluding these costs, SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased from 13.2% last year to 12.8% this quarter. The remaining same-store increase resulted from factors including compensation costs, headcount, and travel and training expenses.  Our earnings this quarter benefited from changes in our earnout liabilities. Each quarter, we examine our estimates related to our earnout liabilities, and with all the acquisitions we have done, we currently have several large earnouts that are ongoing, which is a source of variability this year as we reestimate the likely outcomes for each ongoing calculation every quarter.  This quarter, we reported a net gain of $4 million or $0.10 per share as compared to a net gain last year of $1 million or $0.04 per share in the same quarter. The gain this year was significantly increased by some external variables that affect the calculation, especially the current movement in interest rates and volatility. Ongoing interest rate uncertainty adds to the unpredictability of these valuations in the next few quarters.  After considering all of the factors above, and including the tax credits, net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $87 million or $2.40 per share. And excluding the prior year R&D tax credits and the SG&A expenses incurred related those credits, our net income was $33 million or $0.91 per share, which again includes $0.10 of earnout gain. This compares to net income for the first quarter of 2021 of $26 million or $0.73 per share, which included $0.04 of earnout gain.  EBITDA this quarter was up sharply from last year as EBITDA increased by 18% to $61 million.  Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2022 was $56 million, and this includes the $33 million of cash that we received from the IRS related to the 2016 to 2018 R&D tax credit. But even if we normalize for the tax benefit, we believe this is good cash flow for a first quarter, especially considering the significant investment we are making in working capital as new work starts and in light of our significant organic revenue growth.  By comparison, last year, we had cash flow of $80 million. As you may recall, last year, we received advanced payments on some large projects, and our working capital was benefiting from temporarily lower revenue from the COVID air pocket.  Our debt at the end of March was $412 million and part of the borrowings funded the April 1 acquisition of Atlantic Electric that Brian mentioned earlier.  Finally, we're continuing to actively repurchase our shares with a portion of our cash flow. In the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased 162,000 shares. And since we began our repurchase program, we have bought back 9.8 million shares at an average price of $22.77.  That's what I got on financials, Brian.\nBrian Lane : Okay. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for the rest of 2022 and on inflation and supply chain considerations.  Our backlog at the end of March was $2.73 billion. Sequentially, our same-store backlog increased $421 million or 18%, an increase that is broad based. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog is up by $844 million or just over 50%, with increases across most of our operations and with notable strength in Texas and North Carolina. Our industrial revenue was 46% of total revenue in the first quarter. This sector, which includes technology, life sciences, and food processing, will remain strong for us as industrial is heavily represented in new backlog, as well as in our recent larger acquisitions.  Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government, are also strong and with 32% of our revenue, which is consistent with what we saw in full-year 2021.  The commercial sector is also doing well, but without changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 22% of revenue.  Year-to-date, construction was 78% of our revenue, with 49% from construction projects for new buildings and 29% from construction projects in existing buildings. For full-year 2021, new construction was 46% of our business. So, we are seeing an increase in that sector.  Service increased this quarter by 30% compared to last year, including a same-store service revenue increase of 13%. Service is 22% of our year-to-date revenue, with service projects providing 8% of our revenue, and pure service, including hourly work, providing 14% of revenue. Our service maintenance base increased by 5% in the first quarter to an all-time high of $154 million. Overall, service continues to be a consistent and growing source of profit and cash flow at Comfort Systems.  In all our activities, including both service and construction, we are uniquely positioned to encourage and support our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations.  I am also pleased to announce that we recently published our 2021 sustainability report on our corporate website and you can find it at the top of the main page and on the governance tab or the Investors section of our website. That report will help you see what we are doing, as well as how we continually help our customers to make progress towards their sustainability goals. We have continued to increase transparency, upgrade our actions and policies, and raise our standards in the areas of sustainability, diversity and governance.  We are experiencing strong demand in 2022 and we continue to invest and reward our labor force. As with other sectors of the economy, we are also experiencing supply constraints and cost increases, reduced availability, and frequent delays in delivery of various materials and equipment. We are recognizing these challenges in our job planning and pricing, and we are working to order materials earlier than usual and seeking to collaborate with customers to share supply risks and to mitigate these challenges. We have a good pipeline of opportunities. And so far, we have generally been successful in maintaining activity levels and productivity despite supply chain challenges.  We are also mindful of world events and Fed tightening. However, considering the strong demand and our record backlog, we now expect continued growth in 2022 and we also expect that our EPS will trend upward, although not at the same pace as our same-store revenue, considering our current mix of business.  We believe that good trends outweigh the challenges and we remain optimistic about our prospects for 2022 and beyond. With the highest backlog in the history of Comfort Systems USA, we will continue to invest in our workforce, technology, execution capabilities and our service businesses.  Our skilled workforce is the heart and soul of Comfort Systems USA and we will continue to develop and reward our unmatched team members as they strive to work safely, to build and serve their communities. I will now turn it back over to Justin for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: Brian, just high level one for you. The backlog trend relative to the organic growth numbers you've been putting up is remarkable. How would you explain that to investors just in broad strokes and how sustainable you think this strength is?\nBrian Lane: I think, Sean, you've known us a long time. We are really proud of the labor force and the project planning that we do. We're able to have really good customers. We have terrific vendors that are working through with us to all the challenges that are out there. So, when you combine all that and work with everyone and communicate with them, I think that we'll be able to get to our backlog in reasonable shape. There are challenges. We all know them. Everybody's talking about them. Well, we're just doing the best thing we can to serve our customers, and we'll take care of our people and our vendors to execute efficiently and productively.\nWilliam George: As far as the underlying trend, we don't know what will happen. But at this moment, there is no sign of any curtailing demand. There's a lot of demand on the work we do.\nBrian Lane: The opportunities we're seeing is still very good, Sean.\nSean Eastman: Just in light of the margin pressure from a year-over-year perspective, and part of that bridge being this earlier stage, new construction work ramping up and also this kind of caution and contingency around estimating cost to complete. How does that dynamic evolve? When do we sort of get on the back end of projects and maybe you can start to release some of that contingency. I'm just kind of curious the timing element there.\nWilliam George: I'll start and Brian can add anything he wants. So, guys are leaving resources and jobs because of concerns about all of the challenges that they're facing. Right? So, that makes the fact that we have very good pricing today and the fact that we are positioning ourselves to be able to deal with challenges on a cost basis gives us more opportunity maybe than we've ever had for improvement late in jobs. At the same time, the cost challenges are real. The supply chain problems are real. There's a reason why they're doing that. And so, there's a lot of execution to do this summer.  As far as when we start to see that \u2013 get the question answered, it will be after the summer. So, fourth quarter, our guys will take a very hard scrub of jobs. Most of this work, by the way, we won't be done with this year, the stuff that's starting right now. In fact, very little of it. But they'll take a hard scrub and that's when you might \u2013 you'll really get to \u2013 I think start to get a good flavor for that.  If I had to guess, I think it'll be a mixed bag. I think we'll have some home runs and we'll have some jobs where people really are scrambling and they're spending some money to make sure the customer gets what they need. But I think we'll be in a good place overall.\nSean Eastman: Lastly, just as I think about backlog as a predictor of revenue \u2013 and I appreciate the walk up on the organic growth outlook for this year. Just in light of the big shift in mix in the business, should the burn on that backlog kind of come down versus what we've seen over the past, say, five years on average. Does that make sense? \nWilliam George: Yeah. Yeah, there's two factors. So the mix has been moving really more than ever, which is astounding, towards industrial. And industrial does have a quicker burn, generally speaking, than the rest of \u2013 for example, healthcare, which probably has the longest burn. But some of the new industrial projects are very big, and people are committing earlier, right? They're trying to lock up \u2013 just like we're ordering stuff earlier, they're committing to us earlier, right, which pushes backlog up. So, if I were to bake those two together, I think the backlog has a longer burn than usual. Thank goodness. Right? \nBrian Lane: I was going to say that, thank goodness. Yeah. But it's within the range, though, Sean, your model.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Julio Romero from Sidoti.\nJulio Romero: Can you talk about the mix of new bookings that are coming in in terms of the mix of maybe new construction versus existing building construction? And maybe as well talk about the mix of electrical versus mechanical? \nBrian Lane: I'll go first, then Bill. So, in terms of the backlog, we're seeing a pretty consistent trend. 45%, 50% is in the construction range, heavily new construction today. There's a lot of new projects going on. We are seeing a lot of electrical work, particularly in Texas. So, I think you'll see electrical pick up, although mechanical is staying strong, but electricals will be increasing as a percentage of our business going forward.\nWilliam George: Yeah, I would agree with that.\nJulio Romero: I guess what's the biggest change to the operating environment you've seen over the past two months since the February call?\nWilliam George: I think the biggest change in the last two months is the lack of change. Like, the most surprising thing in the last two months is that there seems to be no letup in people sort of still wanting to onshore. Pharma, still very high levels of interest. So we know everybody across the economy is taking a hard look. So far, there's no sign of that with our customers. So, I'd say the thing I'm most surprised about, but the thing that's most notable is there may be changes coming, but they're not apparent right now.\nBrian Lane: I think, Julio, I agree. The broad base strength of it, too, is still hanging in there. So, not much change.\nWilliam George: You may recall that when we were coming out of a couple of recessions in the past, we were kind of famous for \u2013 everybody would say things are getting better and we'd say, well, we're really hoping they do, but we don't see any sign of it. And we're usually right. In this case, maybe the world's about to end, but we're not seeing any sign of it.\nJulio Romero: Interesting dynamic there. And maybe last one for me. It's just if you could talk about maybe the M&A pipeline. And given the rising interest rates and maybe more challenges for some of the other industry players, are you starting to see any change in valuations for some potential acquisition candidates that you may have had your eye on?\nBrian Lane: The answer is, for ones we've had our eye on, no, the relationship deals are the same. For stuff that people are hiring a broker, there's a lot of stuff that we wouldn't be interested in that we see. It seems like they certainly are expecting to get higher pricing. I've seen instances where that's confirmable. But there seems to be higher pricing expectations. So, we're really happy we had these deals we just did that were based on long-term relationships. I think it was good timing for us to get a lot of good deals done last year.  This year, we're probably going to take a breath. We'll probably continue to do some tuck-ins. But there's a lot of reasons why we've got work to do to integrate and make sure we do that right. Pricing is high. Two of the deals we did late last year, two of the bigger deals would have happened this year. They just happened sooner because there was this conviction that people had for a period of time the capital gains rates were going up. That turned out pretty good for us. I think, this year, there's also \u2013 in the midst of uncertainty isn't necessarily the time to pile into acquisition. So, I think we'll be pretty calm this year. I think we'll keep really developing the pipeline, and it's still good.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. \nBrent Thielman: Brian, when you look at a $2.7 billion backlog that you're going to try and execute on, how do we sort of think about the incremental capacity you have to address kind of that smaller book and burn work. And then, I guess, second part of that is, did you have a workforce capable of supporting an even larger book of business?\nBrian Lane: So, really good questions, Brent. And luckily, as Bill mentioned, it is broad based. So, larger companies have the largest share to work. So, from a capacity and labor standpoint, we're in good shape. We spend a lot of time, as you know, you've known us a long time, timing out this work, labor planning, make sure we have the right resources. We're also very fortunate with an acquisition that Bill did at the end of last year, a company called Kodiak which supplies us with labor throughout the country. So, we do have multiple sources to increase our capacity.  So, I think, right now, as I sit here with you, we're in good shape with the backlog we have and we'll continue to win work and do it. But our guys are really good at looking at their workforces, how much they can take, and when it's going to take it. So, we're very fortunate with the folks that we have running our organizations and making sure they can take work that we can do. \nWilliam George: If you don't mind, I'll add one more specific consideration, which is that, in the same way that our cost of goods sold going from 34% to 40%, materials and equipment, the same way that made our revenues bigger, it makes the amount of labor in our backlog proportionately smaller. So, we've got jobs that are on the very big end. We have jobs that a couple of years ago, we're at a certain size, that where you might top out with 300 people, we have jobs of the same size where the highest number of workers you're going to have on the job site are 200 people. So, what happens is, if materials start to come back down, then it'll make the backlog a little sluggish and suddenly we'll look smart on the margin line. Right? But for now, the trend is definitely towards more materials, paying more for them and that makes the backlog bigger as well.\nBrian Lane: But we're in reasonable shape right now, Brent. \nWilliam George: Yeah.\nBrian Lane: Not a lot of spare capacity. I'm sure the guys out there are saying, you come and do it, Brian. But right now, we're okay.\nBrent Thielman: The second one was just \u2013 the two segments between mechanical and electrical, which would you expect to see more of a kind of a positive inflection in margins once you get towards the more mature stages of these larger projects? \nBrian Lane: You look at the gross margin in electricals at 13% for the quarter, we were up closer to 15% last year. So, I I'm optimistic as the year goes by. We're really early, Brent, in a lot of this electrical work. So we're really watching that closely. But if I had to guess, I am expecting that electrical will see a bigger bump in margins as we go throughout the year, early next year.\nWilliam George: Amen, brother.\nBrent Thielman: Just one more. Industrial continued to be a huge driver for you guys. But I've also noticed, just in the Q, it looks like some of the \u2013 maybe what we might associate as kind of light commercial work, the retail, restaurant stuff seems to be coming around for you, at least from a revenue perspective in the first quarter. And I realize you're not necessarily emphasizing that work. But I imagine it's getting better for others in the industry, too. Is that leading to a tighter kind of capacity environment in general and kind of favoring pricing on these bids as you're going out and looking at new work?\nWilliam George: Demand is good for pricing, right, unless you're doing things wrong. I would say also, you've probably detected a little bit those deals we did in December. We've done a lot of acquisitions that were heavily industrial. Couple of the deals we did in December were more of our traditional stuff that we've done in the past, although they have very complex capabilities. They do a broader mix of work. And by the way, they brought in more service for us. Some of those deals had very, very nice service businesses, especially from the point of view of revenue and customer penetration. They didn't have quite the margins in service that we have. But to be honest, the companies we own today that have those margins in service didn't have them when we bought them. So, hopefully, there's an opportunity there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. \nAdam Thalhimer: Brian, you mentioned Texas and North Carolina strong. Is there anything else to call out at some of the other geographies? \nBrian Lane: Florida, I would say, is very strong. It's strong across everywhere around, to be honest with you. [indiscernible] Texas is obviously \u2013 it's well documented in everything you read, but I think the southeast in particular. Florida is very strong, too.\nWilliam George: You can't get numbers like this, though, with everywhere being\u2026\nBrian Lane: Everywhere being strong. But, no, with pickups, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, very good.\nAdam Thalhimer: What are you seeing in data centers?\nWilliam George: Steady.\nBrian Lane: Yeah.\nWilliam George: Steady at high levels.\nBrian Lane: Steady and consistent and good volumes of work. Very good.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then modular, high level?\nWilliam George: Modular, very, very good demand in modular. We're actively adding more square footage. Today, we have about a million square feet of production space in modular. And that's going to be up significantly six months or a year from now because the demand is very good.\nAdam Thalhimer: I'm not sure how to ask this question. But it's really a question on supply chain. And I guess I'm trying to think through, like, how much variability are you seeing just in your subsidiaries in terms of your larger subsidiaries? Like, are there some companies that are really sailing through supply chain issues and others are really struggling with it? How much variability do you see out there on that front?\nWilliam George: There's a ton of variability about how this is going. But not necessarily just like this company versus this company. It's more like the variability is thematic. One month is nobody can get PVC. And the next month, nobody can get switch gear and then, suddenly, they seem to get some and it's very \u2013 it's clear that our suppliers who are very good themselves are struggling to make predictions to us. And unfortunately, more often than not, their prediction ends up being longer. But, occasionally, we get stuff we weren't expecting. And I don't know, it's very variable, but I don't think it's geographically variable or company type variable. It's just a lot of people try to figure out something that's hard with a lot of variables that \u2013 when is the ship setting off the coast is going to get called in. It's pretty hard to figure.\nBrian Lane: Yeah, I just want to add on a little bit to that. If you look at the whole chain from your vendors and how they're getting stuff and our customers, people are very rational about the situation we're in. Everybody knows it. We communicate with them being transparent. So, it's really important time to really be good at project management. And we're lucky that we are and we're working with these folks, and we have really good vendors. We really do appreciate them trying to help us get through this.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, everybody. I really want to once again thank our diligent employees. They're doing a terrific job working safely, efficiently and productively and taking care of our customers. Also, thank all of you for your interest in Comfort Systems USA. We really do appreciate it. And we hope everyone has a wonderful spring and we'll be talking to you soon. Have a great day. Thank you.\nA - William George: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Lane",
            "content": "Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us on the call today. We are pleased to report a fantastic start to 2022. Our teams are busier than ever, and we are incredibly grateful for their hard work and we thank them.  Excluding the tax gains that Bill will discuss in a few minutes, we earned $0.91 per share this quarter compared to $0.73 a year ago. New work is commencing across all markets and our same-store revenue increased by 16% compared to a year ago. Bookings climbed again, as demand is strong for our services. We had good cash flow, despite deploying working capital to support our growth. Yesterday, we also announced a $0.01 increase to our quarterly dividend.  On April 1, we acquired Atlantic Electric headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina. Atlantic performs electrical contracting in various South Carolina markets, as well as specialized work on airfields in the southeast. This partnership brings new capabilities and new markets to Comfort Systems USA.  I will discuss our business outlook shortly, but first I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? Okay. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. I will also comment on our outlook for the rest of 2022 and on inflation and supply chain considerations.  Our backlog at the end of March was $2.73 billion. Sequentially, our same-store backlog increased $421 million or 18%, an increase that is broad based. Year-over-year, our same-store backlog is up by $844 million or just over 50%, with increases across most of our operations and with notable strength in Texas and North Carolina. Our industrial revenue was 46% of total revenue in the first quarter. This sector, which includes technology, life sciences, and food processing, will remain strong for us as industrial is heavily represented in new backlog, as well as in our recent larger acquisitions.  Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government, are also strong and with 32% of our revenue, which is consistent with what we saw in full-year 2021.  The commercial sector is also doing well, but without changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 22% of revenue.  Year-to-date, construction was 78% of our revenue, with 49% from construction projects for new buildings and 29% from construction projects in existing buildings. For full-year 2021, new construction was 46% of our business. So, we are seeing an increase in that sector.  Service increased this quarter by 30% compared to last year, including a same-store service revenue increase of 13%. Service is 22% of our year-to-date revenue, with service projects providing 8% of our revenue, and pure service, including hourly work, providing 14% of revenue. Our service maintenance base increased by 5% in the first quarter to an all-time high of $154 million. Overall, service continues to be a consistent and growing source of profit and cash flow at Comfort Systems.  In all our activities, including both service and construction, we are uniquely positioned to encourage and support our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations.  I am also pleased to announce that we recently published our 2021 sustainability report on our corporate website and you can find it at the top of the main page and on the governance tab or the Investors section of our website. That report will help you see what we are doing, as well as how we continually help our customers to make progress towards their sustainability goals. We have continued to increase transparency, upgrade our actions and policies, and raise our standards in the areas of sustainability, diversity and governance.  We are experiencing strong demand in 2022 and we continue to invest and reward our labor force. As with other sectors of the economy, we are also experiencing supply constraints and cost increases, reduced availability, and frequent delays in delivery of various materials and equipment. We are recognizing these challenges in our job planning and pricing, and we are working to order materials earlier than usual and seeking to collaborate with customers to share supply risks and to mitigate these challenges. We have a good pipeline of opportunities. And so far, we have generally been successful in maintaining activity levels and productivity despite supply chain challenges.  We are also mindful of world events and Fed tightening. However, considering the strong demand and our record backlog, we now expect continued growth in 2022 and we also expect that our EPS will trend upward, although not at the same pace as our same-store revenue, considering our current mix of business.  We believe that good trends outweigh the challenges and we remain optimistic about our prospects for 2022 and beyond. With the highest backlog in the history of Comfort Systems USA, we will continue to invest in our workforce, technology, execution capabilities and our service businesses.  Our skilled workforce is the heart and soul of Comfort Systems USA and we will continue to develop and reward our unmatched team members as they strive to work safely, to build and serve their communities. I will now turn it back over to Justin for questions. Thank you. I think, Sean, you've known us a long time. We are really proud of the labor force and the project planning that we do. We're able to have really good customers. We have terrific vendors that are working through with us to all the challenges that are out there. So, when you combine all that and work with everyone and communicate with them, I think that we'll be able to get to our backlog in reasonable shape. There are challenges. We all know them. Everybody's talking about them. Well, we're just doing the best thing we can to serve our customers, and we'll take care of our people and our vendors to execute efficiently and productively. The opportunities we're seeing is still very good, Sean. I was going to say that, thank goodness. Yeah. But it's within the range, though, Sean, your model. I'll go first, then Bill.

            "name": "William George",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. I've been doing this call since 2005 and this is the first time I've ever started with tax. And I'm very happy it's for a good reason. The reason I'm going to start with taxes this morning is because our recent tax events affect so many of our numbers.  So, as previously discussed, in January, the Joint Committee on Taxation approved our previously filed refund claims for the 2016, 2017 and 2018 tax years, primarily to claim the credit for increasing research activities or the R&D tax credit.  Up to the end of last year, we had not recorded any benefit for those refund claims. So this approval in the current quarter triggered recognition of a $30 million benefit for the 2016 to 2018 tax year.  Because these credits were approved for past years, we also reevaluated the realizability judgments that we have made with regards to the R&D tax credit for the intervening years of 2019, 2020 and 2021. And as a result, we recorded a $27 million non-cash for now, tax benefit for those years. After subtracting SG&A expenses related to those tax credits, the net result of those gains was an additional $1.49 in earnings per share this quarter.  Consequently, our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 is a negative 130%. Additionally, when we evaluated our taxes for the first quarter of this year, we also included consideration of the R&D tax credit, and that lowered our tax rate for the quarter. Excluding the prior year benefit, our tax rate for the first quarter was 22% and we expect our ongoing normalized rate will be similar in the future.  So, with that background, I'll now discuss our remaining performance. Revenue for the first quarter of 2022 was $885 million, an increase of $215 million or 32% compared to last year. Same-store revenue increased by 16%, a broad-based increase that results from strong conditions with a lot of new work starting, as well as the fact that last year we had air pockets relating to COVID.  Overall, for the remainder of the year, we currently expect high-single digit or low-double digit same-store revenue growth.  Gross profit was $153 million for the first quarter of 2022, a $30 million increase compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage was 17.3% this quarter compared to 18.4% for the first quarter of 2021. Our gross profit percentage in our mechanical segment declined from 19.1% in 2021 to 18.6% in 2022. And margins in the electrical segment also decreased from 14.7% to 13% over the same period.  The decreases in gross profit percentage resulted from several factors. First, new construction is up significantly as a proportion of our revenue. Second, much of our revenue is on jobs that are early in their lifecycle when we generally report lower margins due to uncertainty. Third, with the concerns surrounding supply chain and labor, we are naturally being cautious about cost trends when we estimate the cost to complete ongoing work. Finally, and importantly, materials and equipment are trending higher as a proportion of our costs due to price increases. Material and equipment costs this quarter were 40% of our cost of goods sold as compared to 34% of our costs in the quarter one year ago.  Since we put more markup on labor than we do on materials, higher proportion of material and equipment in our cost of goods sold lowers our overall margin even as our gross profit per labor hour stays strong.  SG&A expense for the quarter was $118 million or 13.3% of revenue compared to $88 million or 13.2% of revenue for the first quarter of 2021. We did several acquisitions in the second half of 2021, so most of the dollar increase is in new companies.  On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $13 million. However, $4.5 million of that increase relates to tax consulting fees and other expenses related to the prior-year R&D tax credits that were recorded this quarter. Excluding these costs, SG&A as a percentage of revenue decreased from 13.2% last year to 12.8% this quarter. The remaining same-store increase resulted from factors including compensation costs, headcount, and travel and training expenses.  Our earnings this quarter benefited from changes in our earnout liabilities. Each quarter, we examine our estimates related to our earnout liabilities, and with all the acquisitions we have done, we currently have several large earnouts that are ongoing, which is a source of variability this year as we reestimate the likely outcomes for each ongoing calculation every quarter.  This quarter, we reported a net gain of $4 million or $0.10 per share as compared to a net gain last year of $1 million or $0.04 per share in the same quarter. The gain this year was significantly increased by some external variables that affect the calculation, especially the current movement in interest rates and volatility. Ongoing interest rate uncertainty adds to the unpredictability of these valuations in the next few quarters.  After considering all of the factors above, and including the tax credits, net income for the first quarter of 2022 was $87 million or $2.40 per share. And excluding the prior year R&D tax credits and the SG&A expenses incurred related those credits, our net income was $33 million or $0.91 per share, which again includes $0.10 of earnout gain. This compares to net income for the first quarter of 2021 of $26 million or $0.73 per share, which included $0.04 of earnout gain.  EBITDA this quarter was up sharply from last year as EBITDA increased by 18% to $61 million.  Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2022 was $56 million, and this includes the $33 million of cash that we received from the IRS related to the 2016 to 2018 R&D tax credit. But even if we normalize for the tax benefit, we believe this is good cash flow for a first quarter, especially considering the significant investment we are making in working capital as new work starts and in light of our significant organic revenue growth.  By comparison, last year, we had cash flow of $80 million. As you may recall, last year, we received advanced payments on some large projects, and our working capital was benefiting from temporarily lower revenue from the COVID air pocket.  Our debt at the end of March was $412 million and part of the borrowings funded the April 1 acquisition of Atlantic Electric that Brian mentioned earlier.  Finally, we're continuing to actively repurchase our shares with a portion of our cash flow. In the first quarter of 2022, we repurchased 162,000 shares. And since we began our repurchase program, we have bought back 9.8 million shares at an average price of $22.77.  That's what I got on financials, Brian. As far as the underlying trend, we don't know what will happen. But at this moment, there is no sign of any curtailing demand. There's a lot of demand on the work we do. I'll start and Brian can add anything he wants. So, guys are leaving resources and jobs because of concerns about all of the challenges that they're facing. Right? So, that makes the fact that we have very good pricing today and the fact that we are positioning ourselves to be able to deal with challenges on a cost basis gives us more opportunity maybe than we've ever had for improvement late in jobs. At the same time, the cost challenges are real. The supply chain problems are real. There's a reason why they're doing that. And so, there's a lot of execution to do this summer.  As far as when we start to see that \u2013 get the question answered, it will be after the summer. So, fourth quarter, our guys will take a very hard scrub of jobs. Most of this work, by the way, we won't be done with this year, the stuff that's starting right now. In fact, very little of it. But they'll take a hard scrub and that's when you might \u2013 you'll really get to \u2013 I think start to get a good flavor for that.  If I had to guess, I think it'll be a mixed bag. I think we'll have some home runs and we'll have some jobs where people really are scrambling and they're spending some money to make sure the customer gets what they need. But I think we'll be in a good place overall. Yeah. Yeah, there's two factors. So the mix has been moving really more than ever, which is astounding, towards industrial. And industrial does have a quicker burn, generally speaking, than the rest of \u2013 for example, healthcare, which probably has the longest burn. But some of the new industrial projects are very big, and people are committing earlier, right? They're trying to lock up \u2013 just like we're ordering stuff earlier, they're committing to us earlier, right, which pushes backlog up. So, if I were to bake those two together, I think the backlog has a longer burn than usual. Thank goodness. Right? Yeah, I would agree with that. I think the biggest change in the last two months is the lack of change. Like, the most surprising thing in the last two months is that there seems to be no letup in people sort of still wanting to onshore. Pharma, still very high levels of interest. So we know everybody across the economy is taking a hard look. So far, there's no sign of that with our customers. So, I'd say the thing I'm most surprised about, but the thing that's most notable is there may be changes coming, but they're not apparent right now. You may recall that when we were coming out of a couple of recessions in the past, we were kind of famous for \u2013 everybody would say things are getting better and we'd say, well, we're really hoping they do, but we don't see any sign of it. And we're usually right. In this case, maybe the world's about to end, but we're not seeing any sign of it. If you don't mind, I'll add one more specific consideration, which is that, in the same way that our cost of goods sold going from 34% to 40%, materials and equipment, the same way that made our revenues bigger, it makes the amount of labor in our backlog proportionately smaller. So, we've got jobs that are on the very big end. We have jobs that a couple of years ago, we're at a certain size, that where you might top out with 300 people, we have jobs of the same size where the highest number of workers you're going to have on the job site are 200 people. So, what happens is, if materials start to come back down, then it'll make the backlog a little sluggish and suddenly we'll look smart on the margin line. Right? But for now, the trend is definitely towards more materials, paying more for them and that makes the backlog bigger as well. Yeah. Amen, brother. Demand is good for pricing, right, unless you're doing things wrong. I would say also, you've probably detected a little bit those deals we did in December. We've done a lot of acquisitions that were heavily industrial. Couple of the deals we did in December were more of our traditional stuff that we've done in the past, although they have very complex capabilities. They do a broader mix of work. And by the way, they brought in more service for us. Some of those deals had very, very nice service businesses, especially from the point of view of revenue and customer penetration. They didn't have quite the margins in service that we have. But to be honest, the companies we own today that have those margins in service didn't have them when we bought them. So, hopefully, there's an opportunity there. You can't get numbers like this, though, with everywhere being... Steady. Steady at high levels. Modular, very, very good demand in modular. We're actively adding more square footage. Today, we have about a million square feet of production space in modular. And that's going to be up significantly six months or a year from now because the demand is very good. There's a ton of variability about how this is going. But not necessarily just like this company versus this company. It's more like the variability is thematic. One month is nobody can get PVC. And the next month, nobody can get switch gear and then, suddenly, they seem to get some and it's very \u2013 it's clear that our suppliers who are very good themselves are struggling to make predictions to us. And unfortunately, more often than not, their prediction ends up being longer. But, occasionally, we get stuff we weren't expecting. And I don't know, it's very variable, but I don't think it's geographically variable or company type variable. It's just a lot of people try to figure out something that's hard with a lot of variables that \u2013 when is the ship setting off the coast is going to get called in. It's pretty hard to figure."

At this time, our participants are on a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Justin. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. Our comments today as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws and regulations. What we will say today is based on the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our teams achieved an amazing finish to 2023 with exceptional results, including unprecedented growth, earnings and cash flow as well as a surge in new bookings. We earned $2.55 per share this quarter compared to $1.54 a year ago. Current quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, with same-store growth of 18%. During the fourth quarter, both our mechanical and electrical businesses grew and increased margins to drive our annual results to new heights. Construction finished an already strong year on an up note, including notable profit and activity increases in our modular business. Service also continued to grow as we continue to benefit on ongoing service investments. Backlog is $5.2 billion, up by more than $1 billion from last year, and we had a remarkable sequential increase of $870 million even with strong revenue. Demand remains supportive and is especially robust in our industrial sector. We are carefully selecting work that has good margins and good working conditions for our valuable workforce. Cash flow for the quarter was superb at $149 million and we finished 2023 with an extraordinary $550 million in free cash flow. Earlier this month, we closed two acquisitions, Summit Industrial and J&S Mechanical. Summit is a specialty industrial mechanical contractor serving the advanced technology, power and industrial sectors. Summit performed off-site and site-based construction, including process piping, equipment setting and large pipe rack trusses. Summit is a trusted supplier to some of the world's largest advanced technology, power and industrial companies and is currently deployed on several major chip fabrication projects. J&S provides mechanical construction services to commercial and industrial sectors across the Mountain West region of the United States and works on many of the largest and most technical construction projects in that area. We are thrilled to have both of these companies as part of the Comfort Systems USA family, welcome. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes, but first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George: Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.4 billion, a 22% increase, while same-store revenue increased by 18% or $195 million. Full-year revenue for 2023 increased by 26% compared to 2022 to $5.2 billion. For the full-year, our Mechanical segment revenue increased by 24% including a big contribution from our module business. Our Electrical segment increased by an even larger 31% and we now have a $1.3 billion electrical business. Overall, our same-store revenue increased by 23% or $931 million. We are facing tough comparables. However, our best estimate is that we will achieve same-store revenue growth in 2024 in the mid-teens with growth weighted a bit more heavily to the first half of the year. Gross profit was $280 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a $68 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage improved to 20.6% this quarter, compared to 18.9% for the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by improved electrical margins. The quarterly gross profit percentage in our Electrical segment improved to 22.9% this year as compared to 18.2% last year. Margins in our Mechanical segment also increased in the quarter to 19.8% as compared to 19.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our mechanical segment includes our modular business, which operates at notably lower margins than our remaining businesses. For the full-year 2023, gross profit increased $249 million our annual gross profit margin was 19.0% in 2023 as compared to 17.9% in 2022. For the full-year, segment margins were similar with mechanical gross margins of 19.0% for the full-year, while electrical was 19.1%. Fourth quarter EBITDA increased 42% to $141 million. Our full-year 2023 EBITDA increased by an even greater 48% as our full-year EBITDA was $499 million. As we look to 2024, we are optimistic that overall EBITDA margins will continue to trend in the strong ranges that we achieved in 2023. Gross margins will also continue to be strong, but gross margin percentage may be more variable in 2024 in light of the effect of amortization and certain purchase adjustments arising from our two large acquisitions. SG&A expense for the quarter was $160 million compared to $132 million in the prior year. And as a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses -- expense was consistent again at 11.8%. On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $22 million due to inflation and ongoing investments to support much higher activity levels. For the full-year, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 11.0% in 2023, that's down from 11.8% for 2022. Fourth quarter operating income increased by 50% from last year from $80 million in 4Q 2022 to $120 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. With improved gross profit margins, our operating income percentage increased to 8.9% this quarter from 7.2% for the prior year. Our full-year operating income was $418 million, a remarkable increase of $165 million. OI margin increased from 6.1% in 2022 to 8.0% in 2023. Our year-to-date tax rate of 16.7% included an incremental benefit of $10 million or $0.27 of tax gains that related to prior years. Although individual items have affected our tax rate lately, we estimate that a normalized tax rate for us is approximately 20% to 22%. After considering all these factors, net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $92 million or $2.55 per share. This compares to net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $55 million or $1.54 per share. Our full-year earnings per share for 2023 was $9 and 1% Excluding prior year tax gains in both periods, earnings per share increased to $8.74 per share from $5.29 per share in the prior year, and that's an increase of 65%. Full-year 2023 free cash flow was a remarkable $551 million. We continue to benefit from advanced payments for work that we will fund and complete in the upcoming quarters. 2023 operating cash flow exceeded our earnings by an astounding $300 million. Over the coming quarters, we expect pre-bookings and equipment advances were normalized, creating some cash flow headwind. In the meantime, these early collections have allowed us to invest heavily and fund acquisitions from current cash flows, while at the same time significantly lowering our debt and interest costs. During 2023, we spent $95 million on capital expenditures, almost double the amount we had spent the prior year. The increase includes the build-out of three vast new modular production facilities and the purchase of mini vehicles to catch up from COVID. In 2024, we estimate that our CapEx spend may be roughly $65 million to $75 million, around the midpoint of the spending levels over the past 2 years. Our substantial cash flow allowed us to pay down our revolving credit facility to 0 and to reduce our overall debt by $212 million over the course of 2023. Again, while investing in unprecedented levels of CapEx buying back shares, increasing our dividend and fully funding both of our acquisitions, the purchases of Eldeco and PECO from cash flow. In 2023, we purchased 139 shares of our common stock at an average price of $153. Finally, as Brian mentioned, we acquired Summit Industrial and J&S Mechanical at the beginning of February. Our best estimate is that Summit will contribute annualized revenues of approximately $375 million to $400 million and EBITDA of $35 million to $40 million. We also estimate J&S will have annualized revenues in the range of $145 million to $160 million and EBITDA of $12 million to $15 million. In light of amortization expense, these acquisitions are expected to make a neutral to slightly accretive contribution to earnings per share in 2024 and 2025. Both of these companies will be included in our mechanical segment. That's all I got, Brian.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to discuss our business and outlook. Our backlog surged at the end of 2023 to a record $5.2 billion. Since last year at this time, our same-store backlog has increased by $913 million, around 23% and the increases were broad-based. During the recently completed fourth quarter, our sequential backlog increased by $870 million and virtually all of the increase was same-store. Our pipelines remain strong. Our revenue mix continues to trend towards data centers, life science, food, chip fabs and battery plants. Those industrial customers accounted for 55% of total revenue in 2023, and they are made to drivers of pipeline and backlog. Technology, which is included in industrial was 21% of our revenue, a substantial increase from 13% in the prior year. The technology sector will continue to grow with the recent acquisition of Summit Industrial as they have several ongoing and large semiconductor projects. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government are also strong and represent 26% of our revenue. The commercial sector remains active, but it is now a smaller part of our business at about 19% of revenue. Majority of our service revenue is for commercial customers. So the proportion of our overall construction revenue from commercial has become relatively small. Construction was 80% of our full-year 2023 revenue with projects for new buildings at 55%, while existing building construction was 25%. For the first time in 2023, Compass Systems USA achieved $1 billion of annual service revenue. Service was 20% of our total revenue, with service projects providing 9% of total revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 11% of revenue. 2023 service revenue was up by 11%. And with our continuing strong margins, service is a great source of profit and cash flow for us. At Comfort Systems USA, our core purpose is to build legacies with our people, customers and the companies who join us. To accomplish this, we strive every day to be the best organization in the world. For a craft worker to build a successful career for construction, service and administrative professionals to grow and thrive, for customers to meet their crucial building and service needs, and for any company in our industry to join with the assurance that their people will be respected and nurtured and that their legacy will be perpetuated and built upon. We believe that our commitment to those principles to our people and their legacies has been and continues to be the lynchpin of our success. Safety, quality and innovation remain at the forefront of our operations. We constantly strive to improve and grow our operations to enable sustainable and efficient building environments to improve the productivity of our diverse workforce and to acquire great complementary businesses. Thanks to our careful and relentless investments in existing and newly acquired businesses, we have the crucial skills and capability to help meet our country's surging needs for mechanical and electrical experts and to build and service buildings, including to grow data capacity for artificial intelligence, to increase our nation's capacity to build its own chips, manufacture its own medicines, supply batteries and provide health care resources for our aging population. As we look ahead, we remain optimistic about the prospects of service and construction across our vast markets. With our backlog over 20% higher than even the robust levels of the prior year, and with persistent strength across our markets, we believe that we can continue to grow and invest in 2024. Our number one priority is to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry. And so as always, I want to close by thanking our over 15,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn the call back over to Justin for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Dwyer from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAlex Dwyer: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nBill George: Good morning, Alex.\nAlex Dwyer: Hi, so I wanted to ask about the backlog increase in the quarter and specifically the modular orders. And was that one order or multiple orders? Was it one customer or multiple customers? And do you think there's the opportunity to see more of these larger modular orders as we go into 2024.\nBill George: Alex, the way that -- so if you look at the sequential backlog increase, about 6 -- a little over 60% of that was an increase in modular. So that was $800-something million. If you look at the year-over-year increase in backlog, about 20% of it was modular. So we have a situation where we had some big bookings in the fourth quarter of last year, which was actually last year was more than all of our sequential increase. And then big bookings in the fourth quarter of this year. And of course, over the course of the year, we burned down, we performed a lot of that modular. We're back to higher-than-ever levels of modular backlog with these new bookings. But 80% of our year-over-year backlog increase is broad-based. So honestly, we just couldn't be happier with the breadth, the composition, et cetera. And as far as additional bookings absolutely. Right now, we're taking as much as we can, but the people who are buying these services from us tell us they would like to give us more.\nAlex Dwyer: Got it. And then the press release mentioned an increase in modular profitability. I don't think we get the disclosures for this. But how was the margin performance this year in modular. And should we expect continued margin expansion in that business this year?\nBill George: So modular margins for the full-year were just a little higher than the prior year, but they're at very, very good levels. You may have heard in my script that I mentioned. The gross profit per modular is lower than it is for any of our other businesses. And that's a combination of it. It does have a high component of materials and pass -- the passthrough. It's also performed -- the work we do in the field is performed with licensed electricians and certified medical gas technicians. The work that we perform in our plants is highly skilled, but it isn't as it isn't as difficult to find that labor. So we're very happy with those margins. As far as margin expansion in modular, we'll be thrilled if it stays the same. Of course, we're always working for margin expansion, but man, when you -- after a quarter like this, it's pretty hard to talk about doing better.\nBrian Lane: We're really happy with the modular business.\nAlex Dwyer: Got it. And then just last one on the margin outlook for 2024. I think we're talking EBITDA margins more so this year than gross margin. There's the deal amortization. I think inflation could be a tailwind to margins this year. And then maybe like a mix versus the early stage versus the later stage jobs could be like a swing factor. Can we just talk about like the puts and takes in margins this year?\nBrian Lane: Yes. So if you look at this overall, I just want to comment on the margin performance we've been getting over really since 2016. We've been pretty consistently having 18% to 20%, leave the amortization aside for a minute. So I am personally thrilled with the level of performance we're getting and executing our work. I mean if I was running this work, I'd be really happy myself. So I consider that we'll keep going. If you want to add on...\nBill George: I think you made all the right points. The one thing I'll just refine a little bit for everyone. So if you think about it, the amortization is always big at comfort because we buy companies on a fairly regular basis. And the companies we buy come with a lot of backlog. So for example, Summit will roll into comfort with something like $400 million of backlog. And the accounting rules require us to put a value on that backlog and amortize it as an expense. In addition to things like customer list and trade name that all businesses have, our amortization is higher than most. Obviously, it's non-cash, the money is gone. It's never coming back. So in a way, it's not sensible to worry about it because you own what you own today and it's going to earn what it earns. But we're required to reduce the sort of the earnings that we present -- the margins we present to you guys for that. And the reason we wanted to call it out is, last year, we had less acquisitions than we have had over the last three or four years proportionate to the size of Comfort Systems. So amortization was probably the lowest and definitely the lowest proportionate to the size of the company that has been in a long time. Well, on February 1, we did our biggest deal ever. We did another top five or six deal ever. And so amortization is going to come back very -- in a very notable way over the next 18 months. And so obviously, that pushes down gross margins because it's an expense. You put tens of millions of dollars, million tens of millions of dollars of expense through your cost of goods sold, and it's all noncash. So the cash flow still does great. EBITDA still -- EBITDA really is what I look at, still looks good. So we're comfortable with the cadence of our EBITDA margins, we are going to have choppiness in the gross profit margins. So sorry, that's a little bit longer, but it's just -- I think it bears -- given the size of the deals we just did and the fact that we were at a low ebb last year, I just wanted to mention all of that.\nAlex Dwyer: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Julio Romero from Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.\nJulio Romero: Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, good morning. Maybe staying on gross margins for a second. You mentioned the same-store revenue for the year, should be looking like first-half weighted. How about the gross margin cadence should that also be first-half weighted? Or how would you have us think about that?\nBrian Lane: No. I mean if I'm excluding what Bill just went through, just in terms of purely operational, I think we'll be pretty consistent at the gross margin level that we've been at. They'll fluctuate up and down quarter-to-quarter, but I think we'll be in that 18% to 20% range for sure.\nBill George: I mean the effects on gross margin from like backlog amortization will be immediate. And then there's also a chance of purchase adjustments later in the year that could make -- could be a little lumpy in a quarter here or there. But if you just -- the business is going to earn a lot of -- it's going to do well. But there would just be a little more noise in those gross margin line.\nJulio Romero: Okay. Got it. What does your capacity look like...\nBill George: The noise can go either direction, just for the record, that noise can go either direction. You shouldn't just hear, it's all bad. Now the amortization will always be an expense. But anyway, go ahead, I'm sorry.\nJulio Romero: No, no. great point. I'm just thinking about there's also a lot of cost pass-through in modular to and how that could -- depending on whether you do it first-half weighted or second-half weighted, it would affect kind of the cadence of things?\nBill George: Yes.\nJulio Romero: Maybe just turning to capacity. How does that look for you guys? Can you continue to take on orders -- and how far out are you booked these days?\nBrian Lane: Well, in terms of our capacity, we're in good shape right now. The backlog, the probably a little bit bigger. So we're in good shape for this year for sure. winning a fair amount of work about 30% of our backlogs into 2025. So in terms of the work we have, obviously, we're spending a lot of time making sure we can execute properly, selecting the right work, et cetera. But in terms of capacity, the workload we have, the workload we see, we're in good shape right now.\nJulio Romero: Okay. That's helpful. And then last one for me is a little bit of a broader question, but industrial and institutional are making up a bigger portion of new construction, as you said earlier, Brian. And I would imagine a good majority of those are owner-occupied buildings, not necessarily spec building. So what are you hearing from those customers in regards to costs? Are these kind of owner-occupied projects just having to swallow a higher cost of capital and tougher project economics just to get comfort to take on the project?\nBill George: So I don't think they're worried about the cost of capital. Our -- we're talking the big tech companies, right? The big pharma companies, they have capital. They -- frankly, they want to deploy capital. As far as pricing, pricing is up, it is -- and it's not a -- it's a -- we have to charge people more because we pay our guys, we need to pay our workers very, very well right now. They deserve it. They worked for us, many of them for generations in case some cases, but for decades, and that's what it takes to get the work done. So I would say pricing is definitely up. We're making sure that we get -- we're taking more -- in a sense, we're taking more risk, right, as we're promising to do something at a time when we're already full. We have to make sure that we get pricing that compensates us for that risk and allows us to do a good job for our customers. But for sure, if you thought -- if you started planning a building two years ago and you're building it today, it is costing you a lot more than you were budgeting two years ago. And that's -- by the way, that's true in a lot of parts of the economy, but I think it's especially true in anything that's using skilled labor.\nJulio Romero: Helpful. Thanks very much.\nBill George: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from Thomson Davis. Your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning, guys. Great quarter.\nBill George: Thanks, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Just since there's so much interest, do you mind just talking high level about data center demand?\nBrian Lane: I'll go first, and Bill can comment. But data center demand is still strong. Everything you read are here, Adam. It's still have a lot of legs to it. So right now, we see no letup in the stuff we're looking at are the opportunities presenting themselves. And I think it's going to be good for a number of years.\nBill George: So you look at Tech whip from 13% to 21% of our revenue. really, we're doing a lot of chip and some other stuff, but that is overwhelmingly data centers. we're seeing data centers not just in our modular business, right? They're very big in Texas and our electrical business. They're very big in like sort of the mid-Atlantic, Virginia. And we're turning -- we're not -- we're disappointing people, right? We're favoring people who've given us -- been partners with us for a long time. But we just -- the demand for data centers is going to force the build to be pushed out over time. And that's one of the great things about modular. Modular is if you're a big data hyperscale, especially data center provider, you really -- people say, well, which modality of building data centers is going to work. We're going to win. And the answer is, is this all of the above world right now. They want to do it modular. They want to do it stick built. They want to do third party. They want to do repurposing. They want to do up adding reconfiguring buildings to support more every way that they can do it is how they're doing it. It reminds me of the way we -- people say, how do you hire people? And the answer is, we hire people every possible way we can think of they're building data centers every possible way they can think of. And for the foreseeable future, if you can help them meet those needs and especially if you can do a really good job, demand, there just seems to be no end to that demand. The demand was big even before artificial intelligence, right, artificial intelligence isn't data center demand is incremental data center.\nAdam Thalhimer: Right. And then you said three new modular facilities last year. That was higher than I didn't realize that. I thought it was one. But what would be your thoughts about expanding modular capacity further?\nBrian Lane: I mean, you get to see what the demand is and see what kind of commitments we get from our customers. We've got the three up and running now. So I mean, we'll see how I think it plays out, which customers would want us to do it.\nBill George: Yes. So round numbers, we did about a 400,000 square foot facility in North Carolina and we did a 400,000 and a 200,000 square foot facility here in Houston. And it's even -- those sizes are great, but these are also buildings that are much bigger -- have much bigger volume. They're taller so you can build. You have the option sometimes or building at levels because remember, these are -- this is volumetric. You're building buildings that get stacked on top of each other. So this new space is really, really great for our guys. We had an opportunity when we came into this space to really take the lessons we have learned in deploying robots and robotic arms and the kind of equipment that can make robotic arms more efficient and faster. And so far, it's doing -- it's going very, very well. As far as increasing the space, I think we certainly have conversations with existing and new customers about what would get us to do that. I think we're probably not going to make serious decisions about that before the middle of the year. But the opportunity is for certain, it's out there right now. But one of the things about comfort is we really want to do a good job for people. And the one thing we never want to do is promise more than we can really deliver at an absolutely industry standard level. And so our number one consideration in taking work is can we do it and do it right, our number -- and almost similar -- almost the same level of consideration is, is this work that will be good for our workforce. Is it in with people who will treat them fairly and work with them where there will be good efficiency so that they can be successful. Is the geography onerous for them or good for them. I mean, in construction right now, a huge consideration is retaining your workforce and you retain your workforce by considering the things that are going to be important to your workforce. So that's actually a very important consideration right now with our best operators.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Super helpful. Last one, backlog expectations. I'm just curious if could backlog continue to build in Q1? Or are you basically I would imagine you're kind of full for the 2024 construction season.\nBrian Lane: Yes, we're in really good shape on backlog this year for sure. You can still grow it because projects are getting little longer. But back to what Bill just said, if the works, good with our good customers, we're going to see what we can do to fill it in, but there's still plenty of stuff to look at, Adam, no shortage of opportunities.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great update. Thanks, Guys.\nOperator: An thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS. Your line is now open.\nJosh Chan: Hi, good morning, Brian, Bill, and Julie. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe could we contextualize your margin strength in the quarter for a quick minute here. I appreciate the guidance that you gave into next year. So what are some of the factors that drove kind of the margins this quarter? And can those factors pretty much continue into 2024.\nBill George: So the factors were remarkably broad-based, remarkably diffuse it's really just good execution, good work at reasons at fair prices and our guys doing a great job of performing it there is very -- is not like -- sometimes historically, when you see stuff like this, there's two or three drivers, right? And certainly, every month and every quarter, there are companies that have an especially good month or quarter, but it's really remarkable right now, how broad-based this is. So I think that makes you more optimistic that it can continue.\nBrian Lane: And also, right, our service business is up to $1 billion. So we continue to grow that with higher margins, too, which is helping our margins as well, Josh.\nJosh Chan: Okay. Yes, that's helpful. Thank you for the color there. And then on the growth -- same-store growth that you're projecting for next year, I guess if it's mid-teens for the full-year and stronger in the first half, could your growth kind of accelerate in Q1 beyond what you achieved in Q4? Just kind of wanted to get the shape right versus what you're thinking in terms of how you get to that full-year of mid-teens.\nBill George: So it's lumpier than you think. So it's harder to answer that question than you think because the range -- you might think we're within -- we can narrow it to a percentage of it, it's really there's -- to get to 1.5 standard deviations is think you might go from 14 to 23 years or something. So I would say it is certainly the case that if you made me -- if you said Comfort was going to grow 15%, if you made me quarterize that, I'd put 1% or 2% more in the first two quarters than I put in the last two quarters. But I will also say all of the factors that drove us to do better are still at evident. Our guys are really killing it. So honestly, one of the reasons we say it's weighted more heavily towards the first-half as we just have more visibility on the first-half, right? So when you promise something, you know?\nJosh Chan: Okay. Yes, that's really helpful. Yes, thank you for that. And maybe last one for me. Beyond what's in the backlog now, could you kind of talk about what opportunities you see in terms of things that you're bidding on, you've been working on trying to get to the backlog or the early part of the bidding process? What are you seeing on that front? Thank you.\nBrian Lane: Well, we're seeing still a tremendous amount of activity. We're being very selective, as we've spoken about and it's heavy and a lot of manufacturing, a lot of industrial, a lot of technology. We're also seeing education backlog and that is the highest it's been in years, particularly university work, some K through 12 and also health care, medical, new build hospitals we're seeing come up. So this is a wide range of opportunities in addition to the food, life sciences, pharma, et cetera, that we've talked about. So pretty broad range, Josh.\nJosh Chan: That\u2019s great to hear. Congrats on a great quarter and great year.\nBrian Lane: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Jean Ramirez from D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nJean Ramirez: Hi, this is Jean Ramirez from Brent Thielman. Congrats on the quarter by the way.\nBrian Lane: Alright. Thank you, Jean.\nJean Ramirez: As a percentage of revenue, what was modulars contribution for the year.\nBrian Lane: 20%.\nBill George: 18%. I believe.\nJean Ramirez: 18%, is that correct?\nBrian Lane: 18%, yes.\nBill George: [Multiple Speakers]\nJean Ramirez: Perfect. Sorry if I missed that. And just continuing on the conversation around backlog. Do -- is there any concerns or any major concerns around your markets near-term or perhaps maybe just taking a look at your capacity or labor or any other inputs? Is there anything to share there?\nBrian Lane: Yes. In terms of backlog on the markets, I don't have any concerns, of course, commercial in terms of office buildings. You obviously not seeing a new lot of office buildings. We just have a lot of service, small project work. The exception in Dallas, in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, Dallas is still pretty busy on office buildings. But in terms of the sectors themselves, I don't have any real concern at all. In terms of our labor capacity, we're hiring all in time. We increased our workforce in the fourth quarter as well. We brought a couple of new companies on that brings us more resources to -- sorry and then we have a temporary labor organization that we have. So in terms of capacity in the backlog, we feel pretty confident about us doing the work and doing the work that we like and that we can do well.\nBill George: So just one correction, modular for the full-year was 15%, getting a quarterly number mix up. 15% of our total revenue came through our two modular operations.\nJean Ramirez: Perfect. Thank you. I appreciate that. And just one more for me. Could you discuss from the latest acquisition, the Summit Industrial construction. What are the opportunities the company sees to grow this business beyond the revenues ranges discussed?\nBill George: Well, it's productive capacity. Both of those two companies have more work available if they can take it the revenue ranges we put in is the amount that's supported by their current backlog, it wouldn't be surprising if they did a little more. They can't do orders of magnitude more because there's a time space mass problem with the number of people. But certainly, virtually every acquisition we've done within a couple of years was bigger. So we're hoping that happens again.\nBrian Lane: But they're really good companies.\nBill George: Now one of the things we don't push people revenue, right? We push them for -- they could do frankly, close to half the time as of a year or two ago, I took a look. Companies shrunk the first full-year we owned them, close to half the time they were smaller, the first full-year we own them. But without with almost -- I don't think with any exception, the third full-year we own them, they're noticeably bigger. So hopefully, that could keep happening.\nJean Ramirez: Got it. Thank you so much for the additional comments there. Appreciate it.\nBill George: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question. And our follow-up question comes from Alex Dwyer from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAlex Dwyer: Hi, guys. Just one more if I can squeeze one in. So the free cash flow conversion in 2023, I'm just doing the math, it was 175% to net income. Do you have any sense of like where this could shake out in 2024. Like should we be expecting something lower than 100%? Or just any thoughts on visibility and cash flow conversion this year?\nBill George: So that's a really hard question because you have to predict the timing. So we have two things going on. One, we have really, really good payment terms on almost all of our work. And that is -- we're overbuilt at unprecedented built et cetera, et cetera. But the big different thing that's going on right now is just when we take these modular orders, we have the right to receive advanced payments when we accept the order. So we have significant amounts of money that are being paid to us sometimes a year in advance of when the work will be done. So it's very, very hard to predict when those orders will come in. I will say -- we just had big orders in the fourth quarter. So some of that money was collected in the fourth quarter. Some of that money will be -- still be collected in the first quarter. So we'll start the year off in a good position. And then I believe sometime, maybe later this year in the third, fourth or first quarter, the next quarter or two where our cash flows are less than our earnings. But I will say this time last year, I thought the same thing and the orders kept coming and we stayed ahead. So that's why it's so hard to predict because when my board asks me that, I just tell them, let's just enjoy this.\nOperator: And thank you. All right, thanks. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Justin. I really want to, once again, thanks all of our amazing employees. It's a great industry, and we really appreciate everything everybody does in this organization. Thank you all for your interest in Comfort Systems. I hope everyone has a terrific weekend and look forward to everybody soon. seeing everybody soon. Thank you.\nBill George: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Lane",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. Our teams achieved an amazing finish to 2023 with exceptional results, including unprecedented growth, earnings and cash flow as well as a surge in new bookings. We earned $2.55 per share this quarter compared to $1.54 a year ago. Current quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, with same-store growth of 18%. During the fourth quarter, both our mechanical and electrical businesses grew and increased margins to drive our annual results to new heights. Construction finished an already strong year on an up note, including notable profit and activity increases in our modular business. Service also continued to grow as we continue to benefit on ongoing service investments. Backlog is $5.2 billion, up by more than $1 billion from last year, and we had a remarkable sequential increase of $870 million even with strong revenue. Demand remains supportive and is especially robust in our industrial sector. We are carefully selecting work that has good margins and good working conditions for our valuable workforce. Cash flow for the quarter was superb at $149 million and we finished 2023 with an extraordinary $550 million in free cash flow. Earlier this month, we closed two acquisitions, Summit Industrial and J&S Mechanical. Summit is a specialty industrial mechanical contractor serving the advanced technology, power and industrial sectors. Summit performed off-site and site-based construction, including process piping, equipment setting and large pipe rack trusses. Summit is a trusted supplier to some of the world's largest advanced technology, power and industrial companies and is currently deployed on several major chip fabrication projects. J&S provides mechanical construction services to commercial and industrial sectors across the Mountain West region of the United States and works on many of the largest and most technical construction projects in that area. We are thrilled to have both of these companies as part of the Comfort Systems USA family, welcome. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes, but first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? All right. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to discuss our business and outlook. Our backlog surged at the end of 2023 to a record $5.2 billion. Since last year at this time, our same-store backlog has increased by $913 million, around 23% and the increases were broad-based. During the recently completed fourth quarter, our sequential backlog increased by $870 million and virtually all of the increase was same-store. Our pipelines remain strong. Our revenue mix continues to trend towards data centers, life science, food, chip fabs and battery plants. Those industrial customers accounted for 55% of total revenue in 2023, and they are made to drivers of pipeline and backlog. Technology, which is included in industrial was 21% of our revenue, a substantial increase from 13% in the prior year. The technology sector will continue to grow with the recent acquisition of Summit Industrial as they have several ongoing and large semiconductor projects. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government are also strong and represent 26% of our revenue. The commercial sector remains active, but it is now a smaller part of our business at about 19% of revenue. Majority of our service revenue is for commercial customers. So the proportion of our overall construction revenue from commercial has become relatively small. Construction was 80% of our full-year 2023 revenue with projects for new buildings at 55%, while existing building construction was 25%. For the first time in 2023, Compass Systems USA achieved $1 billion of annual service revenue. Service was 20% of our total revenue, with service projects providing 9% of total revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 11% of revenue. 2023 service revenue was up by 11%. And with our continuing strong margins, service is a great source of profit and cash flow for us. At Comfort Systems USA, our core purpose is to build legacies with our people, customers and the companies who join us. To accomplish this, we strive every day to be the best organization in the world. For a craft worker to build a successful career for construction, service and administrative professionals to grow and thrive, for customers to meet their crucial building and service needs, and for any company in our industry to join with the assurance that their people will be respected and nurtured and that their legacy will be perpetuated and built upon. We believe that our commitment to those principles to our people and their legacies has been and continues to be the lynchpin of our success. Safety, quality and innovation remain at the forefront of our operations. We constantly strive to improve and grow our operations to enable sustainable and efficient building environments to improve the productivity of our diverse workforce and to acquire great complementary businesses. Thanks to our careful and relentless investments in existing and newly acquired businesses, we have the crucial skills and capability to help meet our country's surging needs for mechanical and electrical experts and to build and service buildings, including to grow data capacity for artificial intelligence, to increase our nation's capacity to build its own chips, manufacture its own medicines, supply batteries and provide health care resources for our aging population. As we look ahead, we remain optimistic about the prospects of service and construction across our vast markets. With our backlog over 20% higher than even the robust levels of the prior year, and with persistent strength across our markets, we believe that we can continue to grow and invest in 2024. Our number one priority is to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry. And so as always, I want to close by thanking our over 15,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn the call back over to Justin for questions. Thank you. We're really happy with the modular business. Yes. So if you look at this overall, I just want to comment on the margin performance we've been getting over really since 2016. We've been pretty consistently having 18% to 20%, leave the amortization aside for a minute. So I am personally thrilled with the level of performance we're getting and executing our work. I mean if I was running this work, I'd be really happy myself. So I consider that we'll keep going. If you want to add on... No. I mean if I'm excluding what Bill just went through, just in terms of purely operational, I think we'll be pretty consistent at the gross margin level that we've been at. They'll fluctuate up and down quarter-to-quarter, but I think we'll be in that 18% to 20% range for sure. Well, in terms of our capacity, we're in good shape right now. The backlog, the probably a little bit bigger. So we're in good shape for this year for sure. winning a fair amount of work about 30% of our backlogs into 2025. So in terms of the work we have, obviously, we're spending a lot of time making sure we can execute properly, selecting the right work, et cetera. But in terms of capacity, the workload we have, the workload we see, we're in good shape right now. I'll go first, and Bill can comment. But data center demand is still strong. Everything you read are here, Adam. It's still have a lot of legs to it. So right now, we see no letup in the stuff we're looking at are the opportunities presenting themselves. And I think it's going to be good for a number of years. I mean, you get to see what the demand is and see what kind of commitments we get from our customers. We've got the three up and running now. So I mean, we'll see how I think it plays out, which customers would want us to do it. Yes, we're in really good shape on backlog this year for sure. You can still grow it because projects are getting little longer. But back to what Bill just said, if the works, good with our good customers, we're going to see what we can do to fill it in, but there's still plenty of stuff to look at, Adam, no shortage of opportunities. And also, right, our service business is up to $1 billion. So we continue to grow that with higher margins, too, which is helping our margins as well, Josh. Well, we're seeing still a tremendous amount of activity. We're being very selective, as we've spoken about and it's heavy and a lot of manufacturing, a lot of industrial, a lot of technology. We're also seeing education backlog and that is the highest it's been in years, particularly university work, some K through 12 and also health care, medical, new build hospitals we're seeing come up. So this is a wide range of opportunities in addition to the food, life sciences, pharma, et cetera, that we've talked about. So pretty broad range, Josh. Thanks. Alright. Thank you, Jean. 20%. 18%, yes. Yes. In terms of backlog on the markets, I don't have any concerns, of course, commercial in terms of office buildings. You obviously not seeing a new lot of office buildings. We just have a lot of service, small project work. The exception in Dallas, in the Wall Street Journal earlier this week, Dallas is still pretty busy on office buildings. But in terms of the sectors themselves, I don't have any real concern at all. In terms of our labor capacity, we're hiring all in time. We increased our workforce in the fourth quarter as well. We brought a couple of new companies on that brings us more resources to -- sorry and then we have a temporary labor organization that we have. So in terms of capacity in the backlog, we feel pretty confident about us doing the work and doing the work that we like and that we can do well. But they're really good companies. All right. Thanks, Justin. I really want to, once again, thanks all of our amazing employees. It's a great industry, and we really appreciate everything everybody does in this organization. Thank you all for your interest in Comfort Systems. I hope everyone has a terrific weekend and look forward to everybody soon. seeing everybody soon. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill George",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.4 billion, a 22% increase, while same-store revenue increased by 18% or $195 million. Full-year revenue for 2023 increased by 26% compared to 2022 to $5.2 billion. For the full-year, our Mechanical segment revenue increased by 24% including a big contribution from our module business. Our Electrical segment increased by an even larger 31% and we now have a $1.3 billion electrical business. Overall, our same-store revenue increased by 23% or $931 million. We are facing tough comparables. However, our best estimate is that we will achieve same-store revenue growth in 2024 in the mid-teens with growth weighted a bit more heavily to the first half of the year. Gross profit was $280 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, a $68 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage improved to 20.6% this quarter, compared to 18.9% for the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by improved electrical margins. The quarterly gross profit percentage in our Electrical segment improved to 22.9% this year as compared to 18.2% last year. Margins in our Mechanical segment also increased in the quarter to 19.8% as compared to 19.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our mechanical segment includes our modular business, which operates at notably lower margins than our remaining businesses. For the full-year 2023, gross profit increased $249 million our annual gross profit margin was 19.0% in 2023 as compared to 17.9% in 2022. For the full-year, segment margins were similar with mechanical gross margins of 19.0% for the full-year, while electrical was 19.1%. Fourth quarter EBITDA increased 42% to $141 million. Our full-year 2023 EBITDA increased by an even greater 48% as our full-year EBITDA was $499 million. As we look to 2024, we are optimistic that overall EBITDA margins will continue to trend in the strong ranges that we achieved in 2023. Gross margins will also continue to be strong, but gross margin percentage may be more variable in 2024 in light of the effect of amortization and certain purchase adjustments arising from our two large acquisitions. SG&A expense for the quarter was $160 million compared to $132 million in the prior year. And as a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses -- expense was consistent again at 11.8%. On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $22 million due to inflation and ongoing investments to support much higher activity levels. For the full-year, SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue was 11.0% in 2023, that's down from 11.8% for 2022. Fourth quarter operating income increased by 50% from last year from $80 million in 4Q 2022 to $120 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. With improved gross profit margins, our operating income percentage increased to 8.9% this quarter from 7.2% for the prior year. Our full-year operating income was $418 million, a remarkable increase of $165 million. OI margin increased from 6.1% in 2022 to 8.0% in 2023. Our year-to-date tax rate of 16.7% included an incremental benefit of $10 million or $0.27 of tax gains that related to prior years. Although individual items have affected our tax rate lately, we estimate that a normalized tax rate for us is approximately 20% to 22%. After considering all these factors, net income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $92 million or $2.55 per share. This compares to net income for the fourth quarter of 2022 of $55 million or $1.54 per share. Our full-year earnings per share for 2023 was $9 and 1% Excluding prior year tax gains in both periods, earnings per share increased to $8.74 per share from $5.29 per share in the prior year, and that's an increase of 65%. Full-year 2023 free cash flow was a remarkable $551 million. We continue to benefit from advanced payments for work that we will fund and complete in the upcoming quarters. 2023 operating cash flow exceeded our earnings by an astounding $300 million. Over the coming quarters, we expect pre-bookings and equipment advances were normalized, creating some cash flow headwind. In the meantime, these early collections have allowed us to invest heavily and fund acquisitions from current cash flows, while at the same time significantly lowering our debt and interest costs. During 2023, we spent $95 million on capital expenditures, almost double the amount we had spent the prior year. The increase includes the build-out of three vast new modular production facilities and the purchase of mini vehicles to catch up from COVID. In 2024, we estimate that our CapEx spend may be roughly $65 million to $75 million, around the midpoint of the spending levels over the past 2 years. Our substantial cash flow allowed us to pay down our revolving credit facility to 0 and to reduce our overall debt by $212 million over the course of 2023. Again, while investing in unprecedented levels of CapEx buying back shares, increasing our dividend and fully funding both of our acquisitions, the purchases of Eldeco and PECO from cash flow. In 2023, we purchased 139 shares of our common stock at an average price of $153. Finally, as Brian mentioned, we acquired Summit Industrial and J&S Mechanical at the beginning of February. Our best estimate is that Summit will contribute annualized revenues of approximately $375 million to $400 million and EBITDA of $35 million to $40 million. We also estimate J&S will have annualized revenues in the range of $145 million to $160 million and EBITDA of $12 million to $15 million. In light of amortization expense, these acquisitions are expected to make a neutral to slightly accretive contribution to earnings per share in 2024 and 2025. Both of these companies will be included in our mechanical segment. That's all I got, Brian. Good morning, Alex. Alex, the way that -- so if you look at the sequential backlog increase, about 6 -- a little over 60% of that was an increase in modular. So that was $800-something million. If you look at the year-over-year increase in backlog, about 20% of it was modular. So we have a situation where we had some big bookings in the fourth quarter of last year, which was actually last year was more than all of our sequential increase. And then big bookings in the fourth quarter of this year. And of course, over the course of the year, we burned down, we performed a lot of that modular. We're back to higher-than-ever levels of modular backlog with these new bookings. But 80% of our year-over-year backlog increase is broad-based. So honestly, we just couldn't be happier with the breadth, the composition, et cetera. And as far as additional bookings absolutely. Right now, we're taking as much as we can, but the people who are buying these services from us tell us they would like to give us more. So modular margins for the full-year were just a little higher than the prior year, but they're at very, very good levels. You may have heard in my script that I mentioned. The gross profit per modular is lower than it is for any of our other businesses. And that's a combination of it. It does have a high component of materials and pass -- the passthrough. It's also performed -- the work we do in the field is performed with licensed electricians and certified medical gas technicians. The work that we perform in our plants is highly skilled, but it isn't as it isn't as difficult to find that labor. So we're very happy with those margins. As far as margin expansion in modular, we'll be thrilled if it stays the same. Of course, we're always working for margin expansion, but man, when you -- after a quarter like this, it's pretty hard to talk about doing better. I think you made all the right points. The one thing I'll just refine a little bit for everyone. So if you think about it, the amortization is always big at comfort because we buy companies on a fairly regular basis. And the companies we buy come with a lot of backlog. So for example, Summit will roll into comfort with something like $400 million of backlog. And the accounting rules require us to put a value on that backlog and amortize it as an expense. In addition to things like customer list and trade name that all businesses have, our amortization is higher than most. Obviously, it's non-cash, the money is gone. It's never coming back. So in a way, it's not sensible to worry about it because you own what you own today and it's going to earn what it earns. But we're required to reduce the sort of the earnings that we present -- the margins we present to you guys for that. And the reason we wanted to call it out is, last year, we had less acquisitions than we have had over the last three or four years proportionate to the size of Comfort Systems. So amortization was probably the lowest and definitely the lowest proportionate to the size of the company that has been in a long time. Well, on February 1, we did our biggest deal ever. We did another top five or six deal ever. And so amortization is going to come back very -- in a very notable way over the next 18 months. And so obviously, that pushes down gross margins because it's an expense. You put tens of millions of dollars, million tens of millions of dollars of expense through your cost of goods sold, and it's all noncash. So the cash flow still does great. EBITDA still -- EBITDA really is what I look at, still looks good. So we're comfortable with the cadence of our EBITDA margins, we are going to have choppiness in the gross profit margins. So sorry, that's a little bit longer, but it's just -- I think it bears -- given the size of the deals we just did and the fact that we were at a low ebb last year, I just wanted to mention all of that. I mean the effects on gross margin from like backlog amortization will be immediate. And then there's also a chance of purchase adjustments later in the year that could make -- could be a little lumpy in a quarter here or there. But if you just -- the business is going to earn a lot of -- it's going to do well. But there would just be a little more noise in those gross margin line. The noise can go either direction, just for the record, that noise can go either direction. You shouldn't just hear, it's all bad. Now the amortization will always be an expense. But anyway, go ahead, I'm sorry. Yes. So I don't think they're worried about the cost of capital. Our -- we're talking the big tech companies, right? The big pharma companies, they have capital. They -- frankly, they want to deploy capital. As far as pricing, pricing is up, it is -- and it's not a -- it's a -- we have to charge people more because we pay our guys, we need to pay our workers very, very well right now. They deserve it. They worked for us, many of them for generations in case some cases, but for decades, and that's what it takes to get the work done. So I would say pricing is definitely up. We're making sure that we get -- we're taking more -- in a sense, we're taking more risk, right, as we're promising to do something at a time when we're already full. We have to make sure that we get pricing that compensates us for that risk and allows us to do a good job for our customers. But for sure, if you thought -- if you started planning a building two years ago and you're building it today, it is costing you a lot more than you were budgeting two years ago. And that's -- by the way, that's true in a lot of parts of the economy, but I think it's especially true in anything that's using skilled labor. Thanks. Thanks, Adam. So you look at Tech whip from 13% to 21% of our revenue. really, we're doing a lot of chip and some other stuff, but that is overwhelmingly data centers. we're seeing data centers not just in our modular business, right? They're very big in Texas and our electrical business. They're very big in like sort of the mid-Atlantic, Virginia. And we're turning -- we're not -- we're disappointing people, right? We're favoring people who've given us -- been partners with us for a long time. But we just -- the demand for data centers is going to force the build to be pushed out over time. And that's one of the great things about modular. Modular is if you're a big data hyperscale, especially data center provider, you really -- people say, well, which modality of building data centers is going to work. We're going to win. And the answer is, is this all of the above world right now. They want to do it modular. They want to do it stick built. They want to do third party. They want to do repurposing. They want to do up adding reconfiguring buildings to support more every way that they can do it is how they're doing it. It reminds me of the way we -- people say, how do you hire people? And the answer is, we hire people every possible way we can think of they're building data centers every possible way they can think of. And for the foreseeable future, if you can help them meet those needs and especially if you can do a really good job, demand, there just seems to be no end to that demand. The demand was big even before artificial intelligence, right, artificial intelligence isn't data center demand is incremental data center. Yes. So round numbers, we did about a 400,000 square foot facility in North Carolina and we did a 400,000 and a 200,000 square foot facility here in Houston. And it's even -- those sizes are great, but these are also buildings that are much bigger -- have much bigger volume. They're taller so you can build. You have the option sometimes or building at levels because remember, these are -- this is volumetric. You're building buildings that get stacked on top of each other. So this new space is really, really great for our guys. We had an opportunity when we came into this space to really take the lessons we have learned in deploying robots and robotic arms and the kind of equipment that can make robotic arms more efficient and faster. And so far, it's doing -- it's going very, very well. As far as increasing the space, I think we certainly have conversations with existing and new customers about what would get us to do that. I think we're probably not going to make serious decisions about that before the middle of the year. But the opportunity is for certain, it's out there right now. But one of the things about comfort is we really want to do a good job for people. And the one thing we never want to do is promise more than we can really deliver at an absolutely industry standard level. And so our number one consideration in taking work is can we do it and do it right, our number -- and almost similar -- almost the same level of consideration is, is this work that will be good for our workforce. Is it in with people who will treat them fairly and work with them where there will be good efficiency so that they can be successful. Is the geography onerous for them or good for them. I mean, in construction right now, a huge consideration is retaining your workforce and you retain your workforce by considering the things that are going to be important to your workforce. So that's actually a very important consideration right now with our best operators. So the factors were remarkably broad-based, remarkably diffuse it's really just good execution, good work at reasons at fair prices and our guys doing a great job of performing it there is very -- is not like -- sometimes historically, when you see stuff like this, there's two or three drivers, right? And certainly, every month and every quarter, there are companies that have an especially good month or quarter, but it's really remarkable right now, how broad-based this is. So I think that makes you more optimistic that it can continue. So it's lumpier than you think. So it's harder to answer that question than you think because the range -- you might think we're within -- we can narrow it to a percentage of it, it's really there's -- to get to 1.5 standard deviations is think you might go from 14 to 23 years or something. So I would say it is certainly the case that if you made me -- if you said Comfort was going to grow 15%, if you made me quarterize that, I'd put 1% or 2% more in the first two quarters than I put in the last two quarters. But I will also say all of the factors that drove us to do better are still at evident. Our guys are really killing it. So honestly, one of the reasons we say it's weighted more heavily towards the first-half as we just have more visibility on the first-half, right? So when you promise something, you know? 18%. I believe. [Multiple Speakers] So just one correction, modular for the full-year was 15%, getting a quarterly number mix up. 15% of our total revenue came through our two modular operations. Well, it's productive capacity. Both of those two companies have more work available if they can take it the revenue ranges we put in is the amount that's supported by their current backlog, it wouldn't be surprising if they did a little more. They can't do orders of magnitude more because there's a time space mass problem with the number of people. But certainly, virtually every acquisition we've done within a couple of years was bigger. So we're hoping that happens again. Now one of the things we don't push people revenue, right? We push them for -- they could do frankly, close to half the time as of a year or two ago, I took a look. Companies shrunk the first full-year we owned them, close to half the time they were smaller, the first full-year we own them. But without with almost -- I don't think with any exception, the third full-year we own them, they're noticeably bigger. So hopefully, that could keep happening. Thank you. So that's a really hard question because you have to predict the timing. So we have two things going on. One, we have really, really good payment terms on almost all of our work. And that is -- we're overbuilt at unprecedented built et cetera, et cetera. But the big different thing that's going on right now is just when we take these modular orders, we have the right to receive advanced payments when we accept the order. So we have significant amounts of money that are being paid to us sometimes a year in advance of when the work will be done. So it's very, very hard to predict when those orders will come in. I will say -- we just had big orders in the fourth quarter. So some of that money was collected in the fourth quarter. Some of that money will be -- still be collected in the first quarter. So we'll start the year off in a good position. And then I believe sometime, maybe later this year in the third, fourth or first quarter, the next quarter or two where our cash flows are less than our earnings. But I will say this time last year, I thought the same thing and the orders kept coming and we stayed ahead. So that's why it's so hard to predict because when my board asks me that, I just tell them, let's just enjoy this. Thanks, everybody."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to your host, Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Valerie. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Our comments today as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws and regulations. What we will say today is based upon the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I am in all of the discipline and execution that our amazing teams continue to demonstrate and build on. They are the true source of our exceptional results this quarter. Our best ever growth earnings and cash flow. We earned $2.93 per share this quarter compared to $1.71 a year ago. Current quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, with same-store growth of 20%. Revenue was higher across our operations and our modular business, in particular, surged while maintaining superb execution for our customers. Service also continues to grow and increase earnings. Thanks in large part, the past and ongoing investments. Our mechanical and electrical operations performed incredibly well. Our backlog continues to track at unprecedented levels, and our pipeline of additional work is still strong. Backlog is $4.3 billion, $1 billion ahead of last year, and we also booked a sequential increase, even though this is our seasonally most active quarter. Demand is especially robust in our industrial sectors. The unprecedented demand for data, chip and battery and strong trends in other areas like food, pharma and health care continue to give our teams the opportunity to show their expertise and commitment. We are carefully selecting work that has good margins and good working conditions for our valuable workforce. Operating cash flow surged this quarter to over $200 million. As our customers continue to recognize our value and performance, with favorable payment terms and timely payments. Today, we also increased our quarterly dividend by $0.025 to $0.25 per share. or a rate of $1 per share on an annualized basis. This reflects our continuing strong cash flow and our commitment to reward our shareholders. We are also excited to announce that on October 2, we acquired Decco, an extremely capable pipe and mechanical company located in New Hampshire, and we welcome that team to Comfort Systems. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes. But first, I'll turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George: Thanks, Brian. We have an amazing third quarter with 20% same-store revenue growth, higher margins and over $200 million of operating cash flow. In addition, compared to last year, both our EPS and EBITDA increased by over 50%. Revenue for the third quarter of 2023 was $1.4 billion, an increase of 23% or $258 million compared to last year. Our mechanical segment revenue increased by $173 million or 20%, and continues to benefit from growth in our modular business. Our electrical segment increased by an even larger [33%] and to $347 million. Combined same-store revenue increased by 20% or $224 million as we continue to benefit from strong demand and some pass-through effects of inflation. We are facing tougher revenue comparables in the fourth quarter of the year, and we currently estimate that same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be in the mid-teens. Gross profit was $277 million for the third quarter a $75 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage improved to 20.1% this quarter compared to 18.1% for the third quarter of 2022, driven by improved mechanical margins. Quarterly gross profit exceeded 20% for the first time in a few years. This quarter, we grew by over 20% on a same-store basis and added 2 full percentage points to our gross profit margin, an extraordinary operational accomplishment. The quarterly gross profit percentage in our mechanical segment improved to 20.4% this year as compared to 17.6% last year. Margins in our electrical segment declined slightly in the quarter to 19.4% as compared to 19.7% in Q3 2022. However, last year, our electrical segment benefited from a litigation win. So core execution and electrical profitability was also notably higher. We are optimistic that for the fourth quarter and next year, margins can trend in the strong ranges that we achieved over the last few quarters. SG&A expense for the quarter was $143 million or 10.4% revenue compared to $121 million or 10.8% of revenue for the third quarter in 2022. On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $18 million due to inflation and ongoing investments to support our much higher activity levels. But the growth in our SG&A cost was slower than our growth in revenue, resulting in SG&A leverage this quarter as compared to last year. Our operating income increased by 66% from last year to $135 million. With improved mechanical margins and SG&A leverage, our operating income percentage improved to 9.8% this quarter, an all-time high from 7.3% for the third quarter of 2022. Interest expense for the first 9 months in 2023 continues to benefit from our extremely strong cash flow. It is also partially and temporarily offset by interest income related to a favorable legal outcome earlier this year. Our year-to-date tax rate of 16.1% included an incremental benefit of $10 million or $0.27 of tax gains related to prior years. Although individual items have affected our tax rate lately, we estimate that a normalized tax rate for us is approximately 20% to 22%. After considering all these factors, net income for the third quarter of 2023 was $105 million or $2.93 per share. This compares to net income for the third quarter of 2022 of $62 million or $1.71 per share. Excluding prior year tax gains, earnings per share increased to $2.74 per share from $1.67 per share in the prior year, an increase of 64%. EBITDA increased from $101 million in the third quarter of last year to $156 million this quarter, an increase of 54%. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2023 was a remarkable $402 million. We continue to benefit from advanced payments for work that we will need to fund and complete in upcoming quarters. Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow exceeds our trailing 12-month earnings by an astounding $300 million. That overcollection must reverse at some point as we pay to perform the work that we have already been paid for. But the timing is unknown, and it is dependent on the timing of future orders and future advanced payments. In the meantime, these collections have allowed us to lower our debt and our interest costs tremendously. So far this year, we have spent $64 million on capital expenditures, which is double the amount we have spent at this time last year. The increase includes the build-out of 2 vast new modular production facilities and the purchase of vehicles as we catch up from COVID. Our substantial cash flow allowed us to pay down our revolving credit facility to 0 this quarter and to reduce our overall debt by $209 million since the year began. And during that time, we also funded the purchase of Eldeco from our current cash flow. We continue to purchase our shares and have acquired 64,000 so far this year at an average price of $134.53. Finally, as Brian mentioned, we acquired Decco at the beginning of October. We expect Decco to initially contribute annualized revenues of approximately $50 million to $65 million at margins that are consistent with our overall business. They will be included in our mechanical segment. So I've got our financials, Brian.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our business and outlook. Our backlog at the end of the third quarter was $4.3 billion. Since last year at this time, our same-store backlog has increased by $0.9 billion, around 27% with increases in our traditional mechanical and electrical business and substantial new bookings in our offsite construction operations. Our sequential backlog increased by $102 million despite the heavy revenue volume over the past 3 months. Our pipeline of future work remains strong. Our revenue mix continues to trend towards data centers, life science, food and other manufacturing such as chip plants and battery. Those industrial customers accounted for 54% of total revenue in the first 9 months of 2023, and they are major drivers of pipeline and backlog. Technology, which is included in industrial was 21% of our revenue in the first 9 months of 2023, a substantial increase from 13% in the prior year. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government are also strong and represent 27% of our revenue. The commercial sector is active, but with our changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 19% of revenue, and most of that commercial revenue is service. Year-to-date, construction was 80% of our revenue with projects for new buildings at 55%, while existing building construction was 25%. Service revenue increased by 14% year-to-date compared to last year. Service was 20% of our total revenues with service projects providing 9% of total revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 11% of revenue. Service revenue continues to be about 20% of our total revenue and our service business is on track to be $1 billion of revenue for full year 2023. In both service and construction, we are encouraging in supporting our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations. And we are committed to being good members of the diverse communities we serve. Comfort Systems is fortunate to have the right capabilities to help meet the surgi need for mechanical and electrical experts to grow data capacity for artificial intelligence and to help increase our country's capacity to build its own chips, manufacture its own medicines, supply its batteries and provide health care resources as our population ages. We are thriving because of our people's commitment, excellence and hard work and because of our field leaders' discernment in choosing projects and managing risk. Thanks to them, we feel confident in our prospects for continued growth and strong profitability into 2024. Our #1 priority remains to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry. We are grateful for their and your trust. I want to end by thanking our over 15,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Valerie for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questions comes from the line of Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: Great quarter. Brian or Bill, I heard your comments that you anticipated margins sort of hanging around the range you spoke of the last few quarters. Any reason to think the margins would be down next year given this year's really strong performance?\nBrian Lane: Not really. As you know, Brent, you're going to have margins move up and down quarter-to-quarter a little bit. But in the aggregate, if you look over the whole year, I think we'll continue to perform at a very high level into 2024. Over 20%, as you know, is extraordinary, right? But the high teens that we've been hitting, I would anticipate continuing to hit that.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. Okay. And then when you refer to a cash flow sort of headwind in the coming quarters, do you anticipate cash flow sort of getting back to that historic conversion rate? Or how are you thinking about that?\nBrian Lane: So it's -- if you combine time period, that's easy, we're going to cash flow our after-tax earnings. We're in an interesting situation now where we've collected hundreds of millions of dollars before we've gone out and done the work to earn it. There will be quarters at some point in the future, maybe middle of next year, but maybe not where we'll be paying the guys doing the work we've already been paid for. So we could have some cash flow quarters where that has to be reflected in our cash flow. At the same time, we'll keep making money on all the work we're doing then. And so it's hard to say where that will bake out. What we won't continue to do is cash flow twice or double our earnings, right? So at some point, we will cash on average over a multiyear period, we're going to cash flow our earnings, no more, no less. So I don't know, it's fantastic news, right? Think about the position you're in when your customers are paying you massive amounts early. But -- and it's really hard to -- we thought we might start to see some of that slide this quarter. So we booked new orders and guys were ahead on their billing. So it's -- I don't really have a lot of faith in our ability to guess which quarter. We'll see some of that turn around because, frankly, our guys keep surprising us in doing better than we thought.\nBrent Thielman: Hopefully, that keeps happening, Bill, but understood. I guess just on modular, could you talk about maybe the dialogue you're having with key customers or new customers now that you've got some additional square footage in place still seems to be some folks that wonder if data center customer spending continues at the rate it has. Just curious any anecdotes you could offer there.\nBill George: So we are doing everything we can to meet the needs of a very large and very loyal customer that we feel like we've really had a great relationship with and we've done our best really to serve them. We have another similar large hyperscale data center customer that has given us some notable amounts of work over $100 million as they try to sort of learn about our capabilities and there's certainly additional work for that customer that we're already looking at on a very collaborative basis. Really at this moment, we couldn't sell as much of that stuff as we can build. As you know, we're in the midst of doubling our capacity. We're not going to decide to go double it again or until we've successfully really done that. But so far, as you can see from our numbers, so good, right? We're in both of those spaces. One, we're doing substantial work in that space. And the other, we're just beginning to build basis. The first thing we're going to do when we really get deployed into the new spaces and get the robotics and stuff in is bring people over from other facilities and let them work during the day. Right now, we're running in some places, 2.5 shifts, and it's not sustainable. So what you can't do is say, well, you're doubling your square footage, so you're going to double your revenue. Some of that -- a big part of that increase has already happened because we had to meet our customers' needs, and we're working those extra shifts. But over time, we hope to just keep getting better, keep finding new ways to automate things. We think there's a really bright future, but what we will not do is get ahead of ourselves.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julio Romero of Sidoti.\nJulio Romero: Just -- maybe thinking about the mechanical segment, I want to kind of dig into a little bit more about what's driving that step up in margins because both sequentially and year-over-year, it's really impressive. So maybe if you could just dig into op leverage, pricing execution, if there's maybe 1 factor that's kind of leaving the others in terms of the mechanical segment?\nBrian Lane: Yes. So as you can imagine, you're over 20%, it's all of the above, right? Good mix of work. It's work we're really good at doing. Margins are good in the work, and we're planning and executing. But at the end of the day, it's going to come down to how well we perform in the field, and they're just performing at a very high level. We don't have -- if you've known us a long time, we don't have a -- we have an absence of significant bad news, and that really does help you. But also, we had a really strong 40% increase in service revenue. We had a very strong service third quarter. As you know, the heat was tremendous. Folks will work night and day to satisfy our customers' needs, both on call-out work, small project, et cetera. the margins are higher in service. That really helps us as well. So we've got good balance, good execution, good work mix and the work that we're good at.\nBill George: Another interesting factor. You may recall a year ago, we were saying we're very early in a lot of our work because we were coming out of COVID, so there was more work starting. Now we really have a nice like cadence of business. We have -- if we look at -- look at our top 100 or 200 jobs out of our 10,000 or so that live are currently on our POC, the big ones. There's lots of 80% complete in there and 65 and 90 whereas a year ago, you were seeing a lot of sub-50 and really low actually the jobs beginning. When you get up to 70, 80, 90, if you're really performing well, you start to get comfortable in releasing contingency. And so part of it is just we're getting to a more normalized book of work. And which just is exactly what we were hoping for, for us in our [indiscernible] stores. These guys are doing it.\nJulio Romero: Really helpful. And then my second question is just on the revenue. You mentioned the same same-store sales growth for the fourth quarter expected in the mid-teens. So I guess that implies like a full year same-store sales around 22% or so. Just -- considering that, I guess, how do we think about -- how should we think about revenue comps for 2024, considering the backlog and growth momentum, but also some of the pass-through costs that may moderate.\nBill George: So we're in budgeting season now. Literally, we're literally going out and getting our field view on that. The comparables get tougher and tougher. Half of the growth until this quarter was inflation. We don't expect net inflation growth, right? We don't expect inflation to reverse currently, but we don't expect it to be a big 10% portion. So I would -- I just don't see how our -- we continue to have same-store revenue growth of 20% next year. The one thing I'll say is we really didn't expect it this quarter, but we do have $1 billion more of backlog than we had a year ago. So it's going to be pretty hard for us to not at least think we're going to have double-digit growth. Quite honestly, we're just -- we're figuring that out right now. This business is a business, you go out and you earn it and you do it every quarter and every day.\nJulio Romero: Yes, that makes sense. And what was the inflation portion of the third quarter sales growth?\nBill George: Almost none. 3%, 4%. I would say. That's our best estimate about what it was for the U.S. economy, but a lot less than it had been recently.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Josh Chan of UBS.\nJosh Chan: Congrats on a really good quarter. Yes. I was thinking about the organic growth. And if only 3 or 4 points of that was price. Could you just kind of talk about how much of the remaining growth is from you successfully hiring more workers or kind of improving productivity within your construction process, kind of how that breaks down to contribute to the really strong growth.\nBrian Lane: Yes. It is a combination of both. We did hire more folks. I mean, we're a good place to work. People want to come and work here. So we had good luck with that. But we also had productivity improvements. The use of prefabrication continues to accelerate. BIM modeling, which is really accelerating at a rapid rates, all this stuff is really helping us out in the field, automation on the welding front, et cetera. So it's a combination of hiring more folks and clearly improve productivity and just really trying to support the folks in the field to make the work as easy as we can for them on the job site.\nBill George: That's crazy. I mean also, we worked a ton of overtime in service, right, with the [heat], that's a point or 2. And then you've got like -- we got 2 points -- we went from 18.1% gross profit to 20.1% gross profit, that's revenue, right? The difference between those 2 is recognized revenue. So this was just a fantastic quarter and really all of the above and we just got to hand it to the guys.\nJosh Chan: Right. Yes, it was definitely a really good quarter. I was wondering if you can talk about the [bid] environment for new projects. I guess for a while now, there's been more work than you and the industry can handle. Is it still the case now? What verticals are you seeing the new projects kind of started to get bid out here?\nBrian Lane: Yes. So I mean, the opportunities are still very strong. It's broad-based, coast to coast, the industrial sectors, and we talked about in our prepared remarks, it's still very strong data, pharma, food, battery, et cetera. So we have not seen a let up in opportunities. As we also said, we've just got to make sure we stay prudent, taking the work we're good at. Don't overextend ourselves and make sure we continue to do good work for our customers. So -- so far, we're in a really good spot right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson, Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer: Congrats on the great quarter. Can you talk about modular for a little bit longer because I'm curious the contract you signed in December, like are you shipping on that now? And then if so, what has been the early experience with margins and productivity? Because I think that was supposed to start with kind of low productivity and ramp up.\nBill George: Yes. So -- just as you know, what was booked in a 10-day period in December was numerous purchase orders. So they range from $20 million to $40 million for individual units that were just all sent over in a batch to get us to help us feel comfortable signing those leases. Some of those have already -- they're already on track. Very small part of them are on track, but a ton of that is already being built up, so we're working [2.5 shares]. And we've received some new orders. The going better than we could have hoped, right? Look at our numbers, right? So far, knock on wood, I don't know.\nAdam Thalhimer: Wait till some new orders versus the ones in December?\nBill George: Yes. So we've gotten more orders. Otherwise, you would have seen our backlog go up by even more, right, in the second quarter, and then it's up in the third quarter, which shows that you couldn't really -- you couldn't be getting 0 orders in modular and hope to have a sequential increase. And by the way, those come in lumpy. I mean, people should not worry about a sequential backlog change unless it's -- unless we're telling you to worry about it. It's -- there's going to be -- if we didn't have some quarters where we had sequentials down, we would spin out of control and go out of business. I mean people I know, love to see that. But right now, what we're telling you is we're turning away work. You're going to see -- I think you're going to see in the overall construction market at some point in the next year or 2 that some -- maybe a little less stuff is being built than a lot of people are projecting. When that happens, it's going to be because the capacity to build it isn't there. It's not going to be because suddenly people aren't going to want AI or chips or our food or because the baby boomers stock getting older, it's just there's so -- there's such a capacity constraint that right now, the governors are the ability to do it. And obviously, that puts us in a pretty good place, right, because we represent a lot of productive capacity.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. Perfect. And then Actually, just a couple of cash flow questions. I'm completely confused in this R&D tax credit. I had a negative in my model like for the next 5 quarters from that -- from the exploration, like a negative cash, a pretty large one, actually. And should I still be baking that in?\nBill George: So here, I'm going to tell you, it got even crazier this quarter. So the IRS released an interpretation where they said, \"Hey, we've got this stuff going on where you can't recognize certain expenses.\" Listen, I'm not -- we'll get you on the phone with our tax guy. But they came out and they said, but you don't need to recognize the revenue related to those expenses this year, it's a 1-year change on a 5-year problem. Suddenly, we didn't need to make a tax payment in the third quarter. It's really complicated. And we just need Congress to pass that extender. It's going to put a lot of little companies out of business if they don't, and we need things to go back to normal. But you're absolutely -- it's a good catch. We expected to make probably $30 million or $40 million tax payment. And we literally -- we'd already -- I think we'd actually literally are ready to -- already approved the payment and then the interpretation came out, which I think might have been the IRS trying to get at least a little bit of relief to the people who are being put out of business by Congress is failure, to be rational. But -- so we didn't pay our -- we didn't have to make that third quarter payment right now. As things stand based on the interpretations that are being agreed by all the gurus, we don't think we'll make a tax payment in the fourth quarter. But then we'll be back. If they don't fix the extender, we'll be back to big tax payments next year because that was like this year interpretation. And if that confused you it is so much more confusing.\nAdam Thalhimer: [Indiscernible] excel spreadsheet.\nBill George: [Indiscernible] insane. By the way, there was a Wall Street Journal article within the last week that would bring you up to about a year ago up-to-date to about the problems for about a year ago, but they didn't even touch on the stuff that's happened in the last couple of weeks. At some point couple of week times.\nAdam Thalhimer: That $30 million to $40 million payment, would that have been for a full year? Are you expecting that every quarter if...\nBill George: That would have been a third quarter payment. And the way the payments work through the course of the year. When you make them sort of 45 days in arrear. So it really wasn't -- yes. It would have just -- it would have been a big payment, but that's not the amount we would pay every quarter on our current earnings. But that's what a third quarter payment would have looked like if we didn't have to make it. It might have been 20 or 30, honestly, I don't know.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. All right. Well, that's fine. And then lastly, what does the CapEx drop to once the new facility builds roll off?\nBill George: I would say it goes down by 1/3. It doesn't go back down to half. So we were in the $30 million range. We're jumping up to the $60 million range. I think we'll go back to like $40 million -- if I had to guess now, we signed a lease for more space, which is not inconceivable. That's a discrete event where one of the spaces we're building out -- what the space we're building out in North Carolina as we're installing 24 overhead track cranes, like cost $7 million, we have to have them. They make -- they're worth it, they're fantastic, the robots we put in, they cost, they're big. They take us a minute to walk past them. So we're making -- but the paybacks on these are like 1 year. So I don't know, hopefully...\nAdam Thalhimer: How much do you pay attention to the core data center demand? Or like what's going on in that market? I mean I know you're getting orders hand over fist, but are you also paying attention to what the market is doing?\nBill George: So 1,000 -- not just are we paying attention. Our guys are literally in some of the meetings inside some of the big -- they're called out to California to sit in planning meetings. And -- yes. So we have guys in our electrical stuff in Texas that are very, very tightly connected. As you might imagine, if you were a hyperscale data center person, you'd have a big incentive to be talking to us as you make decisions and decided what? So we're definitely -- incredibly in connect contact with those people. Now they know what's going to happen, no, what they believe is going to happen is build, build, build.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Crown of Richie Capital Group.\nEric Crown: I guess just one on my end, really. Could you provide just -- I'd love to hear some commentary around the quality of the backlog in its current state during a potential economic slowdown. I guess just to expand on that front. Given the current customer and project mix that you guys have, should we think about the probability of canceled orders or slowdown any differently than kind of the historical cadence for the company during the downturn that...\nBill George: So here's the thing. At any given time, between 80% and 90% of our backlog is work that's already in progress. So it's the cost -- we don't put something in the backlog until after we have a price and a scope and a commitment. And that almost always happens after the building has already started because somebody -- so we have had very, very few cancellations over the last 25 years. Until COVID, we had only had 1 cancellation over $20 million, something that went into our backlog and came out. During COVID, we had $60 million or $70 million that we took out of backlog because they were put -- in the middle of work, some stuff was put on hold with no recommencement date. All of that work has come back and been finished. So our definition of backlog is so strict that we rarely, rarely -- people just don't build -- have build a building in stock, very much in the U.S. Most places, it's illegal to do that. So our backlog is very firmly committed historically. And is it possible that something? Yes, the thing that really when you're exposed to certain clients, it's possible they say stop stuff for a period of time. If anybody says stops stuff, if they don't have a recommenced date, we take it out of backlog because we have a super strict definition of backlog we just always have. But [indiscernible] the quality of our backlog has never been better. It's a astoundingly good. It's really good. It's worked -- yes, it's astoundingly good. It's never been better.\nEric Crown: That's extremely helpful. And yes, I guess that makes a lot of sense. It's less of a concern of cancellations or postponements or anything more just a slowdown things being brought into the backlog? And I guess from that aspect, are there any kind of customer types that you flag maybe on the top of the list, if there was a slowdown, maybe work from their end would slow down a little bit as well.\nBill George: So commercial would 100% be the one that you would worry about right now, especially office building. We only -- less than 20% of our revenue right now is commercial and it's almost all service. So we just happened not to play in that market. And the markets that are important for us I think I would say in the backlog, there's no real discernible risk. In the pipeline stuff that we consider very high potential, what could happen is people can figure out AI is not real or the chip stuff could be get bogged down in, I don't know, they'd be sort of -- or by the way, the biggest risk -- if you look back in the last 20 years, the 2 times we hit a big delay, a big air pocket would have been 9/11, and I guess that's more than 20 years ago and then the financial crisis when the financial crisis first hit, there were some serious delays on jobs. Although even then we were profitable right through it.\nEric Crown: Congrats on a great quarter.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Brian Lane, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks, everyone, for your interest in Comfort Systems. I really want to once again thank our amazing employees, fantastic, fantastic job. I hope everyone has a wonderful upcoming holiday season. Stay safe. We look forward to seeing everyone and have a great weekend. Thank you.\nBill George: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Brian Lane",
            "content": "Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. I am in all of the discipline and execution that our amazing teams continue to demonstrate and build on. They are the true source of our exceptional results this quarter. Our best ever growth earnings and cash flow. We earned $2.93 per share this quarter compared to $1.71 a year ago. Current quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, with same-store growth of 20%. Revenue was higher across our operations and our modular business, in particular, surged while maintaining superb execution for our customers. Service also continues to grow and increase earnings. Thanks in large part, the past and ongoing investments. Our mechanical and electrical operations performed incredibly well. Our backlog continues to track at unprecedented levels, and our pipeline of additional work is still strong. Backlog is $4.3 billion, $1 billion ahead of last year, and we also booked a sequential increase, even though this is our seasonally most active quarter. Demand is especially robust in our industrial sectors. The unprecedented demand for data, chip and battery and strong trends in other areas like food, pharma and health care continue to give our teams the opportunity to show their expertise and commitment. We are carefully selecting work that has good margins and good working conditions for our valuable workforce. Operating cash flow surged this quarter to over $200 million. As our customers continue to recognize our value and performance, with favorable payment terms and timely payments. Today, we also increased our quarterly dividend by $0.025 to $0.25 per share. or a rate of $1 per share on an annualized basis. This reflects our continuing strong cash flow and our commitment to reward our shareholders. We are also excited to announce that on October 2, we acquired Decco, an extremely capable pipe and mechanical company located in New Hampshire, and we welcome that team to Comfort Systems. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes. But first, I'll turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? Okay. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our business and outlook. Our backlog at the end of the third quarter was $4.3 billion. Since last year at this time, our same-store backlog has increased by $0.9 billion, around 27% with increases in our traditional mechanical and electrical business and substantial new bookings in our offsite construction operations. Our sequential backlog increased by $102 million despite the heavy revenue volume over the past 3 months. Our pipeline of future work remains strong. Our revenue mix continues to trend towards data centers, life science, food and other manufacturing such as chip plants and battery. Those industrial customers accounted for 54% of total revenue in the first 9 months of 2023, and they are major drivers of pipeline and backlog. Technology, which is included in industrial was 21% of our revenue in the first 9 months of 2023, a substantial increase from 13% in the prior year. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government are also strong and represent 27% of our revenue. The commercial sector is active, but with our changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 19% of revenue, and most of that commercial revenue is service. Year-to-date, construction was 80% of our revenue with projects for new buildings at 55%, while existing building construction was 25%. Service revenue increased by 14% year-to-date compared to last year. Service was 20% of our total revenues with service projects providing 9% of total revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 11% of revenue. Service revenue continues to be about 20% of our total revenue and our service business is on track to be $1 billion of revenue for full year 2023. In both service and construction, we are encouraging in supporting our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations. And we are committed to being good members of the diverse communities we serve. Comfort Systems is fortunate to have the right capabilities to help meet the surgi need for mechanical and electrical experts to grow data capacity for artificial intelligence and to help increase our country's capacity to build its own chips, manufacture its own medicines, supply its batteries and provide health care resources as our population ages. We are thriving because of our people's commitment, excellence and hard work and because of our field leaders' discernment in choosing projects and managing risk. Thanks to them, we feel confident in our prospects for continued growth and strong profitability into 2024. Our #1 priority remains to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry. We are grateful for their and your trust. I want to end by thanking our over 15,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Valerie for questions. Thank you. Not really. As you know, Brent, you're going to have margins move up and down quarter-to-quarter a little bit. But in the aggregate, if you look over the whole year, I think we'll continue to perform at a very high level into 2024. Over 20%, as you know, is extraordinary, right? But the high teens that we've been hitting, I would anticipate continuing to hit that. So it's -- if you combine time period, that's easy, we're going to cash flow our after-tax earnings. We're in an interesting situation now where we've collected hundreds of millions of dollars before we've gone out and done the work to earn it. There will be quarters at some point in the future, maybe middle of next year, but maybe not where we'll be paying the guys doing the work we've already been paid for. So we could have some cash flow quarters where that has to be reflected in our cash flow. At the same time, we'll keep making money on all the work we're doing then. And so it's hard to say where that will bake out. What we won't continue to do is cash flow twice or double our earnings, right? So at some point, we will cash on average over a multiyear period, we're going to cash flow our earnings, no more, no less. So I don't know, it's fantastic news, right? Think about the position you're in when your customers are paying you massive amounts early. But -- and it's really hard to -- we thought we might start to see some of that slide this quarter. So we booked new orders and guys were ahead on their billing. So it's -- I don't really have a lot of faith in our ability to guess which quarter. We'll see some of that turn around because, frankly, our guys keep surprising us in doing better than we thought. Yes. So as you can imagine, you're over 20%, it's all of the above, right? Good mix of work. It's work we're really good at doing. Margins are good in the work, and we're planning and executing. But at the end of the day, it's going to come down to how well we perform in the field, and they're just performing at a very high level. We don't have -- if you've known us a long time, we don't have a -- we have an absence of significant bad news, and that really does help you. But also, we had a really strong 40% increase in service revenue. We had a very strong service third quarter. As you know, the heat was tremendous. Folks will work night and day to satisfy our customers' needs, both on call-out work, small project, et cetera. the margins are higher in service. That really helps us as well. So we've got good balance, good execution, good work mix and the work that we're good at. Yes. It is a combination of both. We did hire more folks. I mean, we're a good place to work. People want to come and work here. So we had good luck with that. But we also had productivity improvements. The use of prefabrication continues to accelerate. BIM modeling, which is really accelerating at a rapid rates, all this stuff is really helping us out in the field, automation on the welding front, et cetera. So it's a combination of hiring more folks and clearly improve productivity and just really trying to support the folks in the field to make the work as easy as we can for them on the job site. Yes. So I mean, the opportunities are still very strong. It's broad-based, coast to coast, the industrial sectors, and we talked about in our prepared remarks, it's still very strong data, pharma, food, battery, et cetera. So we have not seen a let up in opportunities. As we also said, we've just got to make sure we stay prudent, taking the work we're good at. Don't overextend ourselves and make sure we continue to do good work for our customers. So -- so far, we're in a really good spot right now. Okay. Thanks, everyone, for your interest in Comfort Systems. I really want to once again thank our amazing employees, fantastic, fantastic job. I hope everyone has a wonderful upcoming holiday season. Stay safe. We look forward to seeing everyone and have a great weekend. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill George",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. We have an amazing third quarter with 20% same-store revenue growth, higher margins and over $200 million of operating cash flow. In addition, compared to last year, both our EPS and EBITDA increased by over 50%. Revenue for the third quarter of 2023 was $1.4 billion, an increase of 23% or $258 million compared to last year. Our mechanical segment revenue increased by $173 million or 20%, and continues to benefit from growth in our modular business. Our electrical segment increased by an even larger [33%] and to $347 million. Combined same-store revenue increased by 20% or $224 million as we continue to benefit from strong demand and some pass-through effects of inflation. We are facing tougher revenue comparables in the fourth quarter of the year, and we currently estimate that same-store revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be in the mid-teens. Gross profit was $277 million for the third quarter a $75 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage improved to 20.1% this quarter compared to 18.1% for the third quarter of 2022, driven by improved mechanical margins. Quarterly gross profit exceeded 20% for the first time in a few years. This quarter, we grew by over 20% on a same-store basis and added 2 full percentage points to our gross profit margin, an extraordinary operational accomplishment. The quarterly gross profit percentage in our mechanical segment improved to 20.4% this year as compared to 17.6% last year. Margins in our electrical segment declined slightly in the quarter to 19.4% as compared to 19.7% in Q3 2022. However, last year, our electrical segment benefited from a litigation win. So core execution and electrical profitability was also notably higher. We are optimistic that for the fourth quarter and next year, margins can trend in the strong ranges that we achieved over the last few quarters. SG&A expense for the quarter was $143 million or 10.4% revenue compared to $121 million or 10.8% of revenue for the third quarter in 2022. On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $18 million due to inflation and ongoing investments to support our much higher activity levels. But the growth in our SG&A cost was slower than our growth in revenue, resulting in SG&A leverage this quarter as compared to last year. Our operating income increased by 66% from last year to $135 million. With improved mechanical margins and SG&A leverage, our operating income percentage improved to 9.8% this quarter, an all-time high from 7.3% for the third quarter of 2022. Interest expense for the first 9 months in 2023 continues to benefit from our extremely strong cash flow. It is also partially and temporarily offset by interest income related to a favorable legal outcome earlier this year. Our year-to-date tax rate of 16.1% included an incremental benefit of $10 million or $0.27 of tax gains related to prior years. Although individual items have affected our tax rate lately, we estimate that a normalized tax rate for us is approximately 20% to 22%. After considering all these factors, net income for the third quarter of 2023 was $105 million or $2.93 per share. This compares to net income for the third quarter of 2022 of $62 million or $1.71 per share. Excluding prior year tax gains, earnings per share increased to $2.74 per share from $1.67 per share in the prior year, an increase of 64%. EBITDA increased from $101 million in the third quarter of last year to $156 million this quarter, an increase of 54%. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2023 was a remarkable $402 million. We continue to benefit from advanced payments for work that we will need to fund and complete in upcoming quarters. Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow exceeds our trailing 12-month earnings by an astounding $300 million. That overcollection must reverse at some point as we pay to perform the work that we have already been paid for. But the timing is unknown, and it is dependent on the timing of future orders and future advanced payments. In the meantime, these collections have allowed us to lower our debt and our interest costs tremendously. So far this year, we have spent $64 million on capital expenditures, which is double the amount we have spent at this time last year. The increase includes the build-out of 2 vast new modular production facilities and the purchase of vehicles as we catch up from COVID. Our substantial cash flow allowed us to pay down our revolving credit facility to 0 this quarter and to reduce our overall debt by $209 million since the year began. And during that time, we also funded the purchase of Eldeco from our current cash flow. We continue to purchase our shares and have acquired 64,000 so far this year at an average price of $134.53. Finally, as Brian mentioned, we acquired Decco at the beginning of October. We expect Decco to initially contribute annualized revenues of approximately $50 million to $65 million at margins that are consistent with our overall business. They will be included in our mechanical segment. So I've got our financials, Brian. So we are doing everything we can to meet the needs of a very large and very loyal customer that we feel like we've really had a great relationship with and we've done our best really to serve them. We have another similar large hyperscale data center customer that has given us some notable amounts of work over $100 million as they try to sort of learn about our capabilities and there's certainly additional work for that customer that we're already looking at on a very collaborative basis. Really at this moment, we couldn't sell as much of that stuff as we can build. As you know, we're in the midst of doubling our capacity. We're not going to decide to go double it again or until we've successfully really done that. But so far, as you can see from our numbers, so good, right? We're in both of those spaces. One, we're doing substantial work in that space. And the other, we're just beginning to build basis. The first thing we're going to do when we really get deployed into the new spaces and get the robotics and stuff in is bring people over from other facilities and let them work during the day. Right now, we're running in some places, 2.5 shifts, and it's not sustainable. So what you can't do is say, well, you're doubling your square footage, so you're going to double your revenue. Some of that -- a big part of that increase has already happened because we had to meet our customers' needs, and we're working those extra shifts. But over time, we hope to just keep getting better, keep finding new ways to automate things. We think there's a really bright future, but what we will not do is get ahead of ourselves. Another interesting factor. You may recall a year ago, we were saying we're very early in a lot of our work because we were coming out of COVID, so there was more work starting. Now we really have a nice like cadence of business. We have -- if we look at -- look at our top 100 or 200 jobs out of our 10,000 or so that live are currently on our POC, the big ones. There's lots of 80% complete in there and 65 and 90 whereas a year ago, you were seeing a lot of sub-50 and really low actually the jobs beginning. When you get up to 70, 80, 90, if you're really performing well, you start to get comfortable in releasing contingency. And so part of it is just we're getting to a more normalized book of work. And which just is exactly what we were hoping for, for us in our [indiscernible] stores. These guys are doing it. So we're in budgeting season now. Literally, we're literally going out and getting our field view on that. The comparables get tougher and tougher. Half of the growth until this quarter was inflation. We don't expect net inflation growth, right? We don't expect inflation to reverse currently, but we don't expect it to be a big 10% portion. So I would -- I just don't see how our -- we continue to have same-store revenue growth of 20% next year. The one thing I'll say is we really didn't expect it this quarter, but we do have $1 billion more of backlog than we had a year ago. So it's going to be pretty hard for us to not at least think we're going to have double-digit growth. Quite honestly, we're just -- we're figuring that out right now. This business is a business, you go out and you earn it and you do it every quarter and every day. Almost none. 3%, 4%. I would say. That's our best estimate about what it was for the U.S. economy, but a lot less than it had been recently. That's crazy. I mean also, we worked a ton of overtime in service, right, with the [heat], that's a point or 2. And then you've got like -- we got 2 points -- we went from 18.1% gross profit to 20.1% gross profit, that's revenue, right? The difference between those 2 is recognized revenue. So this was just a fantastic quarter and really all of the above and we just got to hand it to the guys. Yes. So -- just as you know, what was booked in a 10-day period in December was numerous purchase orders. So they range from $20 million to $40 million for individual units that were just all sent over in a batch to get us to help us feel comfortable signing those leases. Some of those have already -- they're already on track. Very small part of them are on track, but a ton of that is already being built up, so we're working [2.5 shares]. And we've received some new orders. The going better than we could have hoped, right? Look at our numbers, right? So far, knock on wood, I don't know. Yes. So we've gotten more orders. Otherwise, you would have seen our backlog go up by even more, right, in the second quarter, and then it's up in the third quarter, which shows that you couldn't really -- you couldn't be getting 0 orders in modular and hope to have a sequential increase. And by the way, those come in lumpy. I mean, people should not worry about a sequential backlog change unless it's -- unless we're telling you to worry about it. It's -- there's going to be -- if we didn't have some quarters where we had sequentials down, we would spin out of control and go out of business. I mean people I know, love to see that. But right now, what we're telling you is we're turning away work. You're going to see -- I think you're going to see in the overall construction market at some point in the next year or 2 that some -- maybe a little less stuff is being built than a lot of people are projecting. When that happens, it's going to be because the capacity to build it isn't there. It's not going to be because suddenly people aren't going to want AI or chips or our food or because the baby boomers stock getting older, it's just there's so -- there's such a capacity constraint that right now, the governors are the ability to do it. And obviously, that puts us in a pretty good place, right, because we represent a lot of productive capacity. So here, I'm going to tell you, it got even crazier this quarter. So the IRS released an interpretation where they said, \"Hey, we've got this stuff going on where you can't recognize certain expenses.\" Listen, I'm not -- we'll get you on the phone with our tax guy. But they came out and they said, but you don't need to recognize the revenue related to those expenses this year, it's a 1-year change on a 5-year problem. Suddenly, we didn't need to make a tax payment in the third quarter. It's really complicated. And we just need Congress to pass that extender. It's going to put a lot of little companies out of business if they don't, and we need things to go back to normal. But you're absolutely -- it's a good catch. We expected to make probably $30 million or $40 million tax payment. And we literally -- we'd already -- I think we'd actually literally are ready to -- already approved the payment and then the interpretation came out, which I think might have been the IRS trying to get at least a little bit of relief to the people who are being put out of business by Congress is failure, to be rational. But -- so we didn't pay our -- we didn't have to make that third quarter payment right now. As things stand based on the interpretations that are being agreed by all the gurus, we don't think we'll make a tax payment in the fourth quarter. But then we'll be back. If they don't fix the extender, we'll be back to big tax payments next year because that was like this year interpretation. And if that confused you it is so much more confusing. [Indiscernible] insane. By the way, there was a Wall Street Journal article within the last week that would bring you up to about a year ago up-to-date to about the problems for about a year ago, but they didn't even touch on the stuff that's happened in the last couple of weeks. At some point couple of week times. That would have been a third quarter payment. And the way the payments work through the course of the year. When you make them sort of 45 days in arrear. So it really wasn't -- yes. It would have just -- it would have been a big payment, but that's not the amount we would pay every quarter on our current earnings. But that's what a third quarter payment would have looked like if we didn't have to make it. It might have been 20 or 30, honestly, I don't know. I would say it goes down by 1/3. It doesn't go back down to half. So we were in the $30 million range. We're jumping up to the $60 million range. I think we'll go back to like $40 million -- if I had to guess now, we signed a lease for more space, which is not inconceivable. That's a discrete event where one of the spaces we're building out -- what the space we're building out in North Carolina as we're installing 24 overhead track cranes, like cost $7 million, we have to have them. They make -- they're worth it, they're fantastic, the robots we put in, they cost, they're big. They take us a minute to walk past them. So we're making -- but the paybacks on these are like 1 year. So I don't know, hopefully... So 1,000 -- not just are we paying attention. Our guys are literally in some of the meetings inside some of the big -- they're called out to California to sit in planning meetings. And -- yes. So we have guys in our electrical stuff in Texas that are very, very tightly connected. As you might imagine, if you were a hyperscale data center person, you'd have a big incentive to be talking to us as you make decisions and decided what? So we're definitely -- incredibly in connect contact with those people. Now they know what's going to happen, no, what they believe is going to happen is build, build, build. So here's the thing. At any given time, between 80% and 90% of our backlog is work that's already in progress. So it's the cost -- we don't put something in the backlog until after we have a price and a scope and a commitment. And that almost always happens after the building has already started because somebody -- so we have had very, very few cancellations over the last 25 years. Until COVID, we had only had 1 cancellation over $20 million, something that went into our backlog and came out. During COVID, we had $60 million or $70 million that we took out of backlog because they were put -- in the middle of work, some stuff was put on hold with no recommencement date. All of that work has come back and been finished. So our definition of backlog is so strict that we rarely, rarely -- people just don't build -- have build a building in stock, very much in the U.S. Most places, it's illegal to do that. So our backlog is very firmly committed historically. And is it possible that something? Yes, the thing that really when you're exposed to certain clients, it's possible they say stop stuff for a period of time. If anybody says stops stuff, if they don't have a recommenced date, we take it out of backlog because we have a super strict definition of backlog we just always have. But [indiscernible] the quality of our backlog has never been better. It's a astoundingly good. It's really good. It's worked -- yes, it's astoundingly good. It's never been better. So commercial would 100% be the one that you would worry about right now, especially office building. We only -- less than 20% of our revenue right now is commercial and it's almost all service. So we just happened not to play in that market. And the markets that are important for us I think I would say in the backlog, there's no real discernible risk. In the pipeline stuff that we consider very high potential, what could happen is people can figure out AI is not real or the chip stuff could be get bogged down in, I don't know, they'd be sort of -- or by the way, the biggest risk -- if you look back in the last 20 years, the 2 times we hit a big delay, a big air pocket would have been 9/11, and I guess that's more than 20 years ago and then the financial crisis when the financial crisis first hit, there were some serious delays on jobs. Although even then we were profitable right through it. Thanks."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff : Thanks, Valerie. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort System USA's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Our comments today as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable security laws and regulations. What we will say today is based upon the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane : All right. Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We had another great quarter. Our teams delivered remarkable execution, and we are grateful for their dedication, especially in this very hot weather. We have never had a stronger demand environment, and we are carefully selecting work that has good margins and good working conditions for our valuable people. We earned $1.93 per share this quarter compared to $1.17 a year ago. Current quarter revenue was $1.3 billion with same-store growth of 24%, reflecting strong ongoing demand in our markets. Our mechanical operations continued to perform at high levels, and Electrical segment margins increased significantly. This quarter includes continued growth and solid performance in our modular business and service has maintained its upward trajectory. Additionally, our backlog continues to track at unprecedented levels despite a strong revenue for the quarter. Backlog is $4.2 billion, which is $1.4 billion higher than it was at the same time last year. Our strong execution and favorable payment terms on new work helped us achieve $100 million of cash flow in the second quarter. Today, we also increased our quarterly dividend by $0.025 to $0.225 per share, which reflects our continuing strong cash flow and our commitment to reward our shareholders. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes but first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George : Thanks, Brian. We had an amazing quarter; with 24% same-store revenue growth, higher margins, SG&A leverage over $100 million of cash flow and our EBITDA increased by a remarkable 45% compared to last year. Specifically, revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $1.3 billion, an increase of 27% or $278 million compared to last year. Our Mechanical segment revenue increased by $199 million or 26%, and it continues to benefit from growth in our modular business. Our Electrical segment increased by an even larger 33% and to $321 million. Combined same-store revenue increased by 24% or $247 million as we continue to benefit from strong demand and some pass-through effects of inflation. We are facing tougher revenue comparables in the second half of the year, and we currently estimate that revenue growth in the second half will be in the high single to low double digits and currently expect that percentage revenue growth for the full year is likely to be in the high teens. Gross profit was $228 million for the second quarter, a $53 million improvement compared to last year. Our gross profit percentage improved to 17.6% this quarter compared to 17.2% for the second quarter of 2022, driven by improved electrical margins. Quarterly gross profit percentage in our Mechanical segment was the same this year and last year at 17.8%. Margins in our Electrical segment rose in the quarter to 17.0% as compared to 15.1% in Q2 2022. It's hard to predict how margins will unfold for the remainder of 2023 and in light of material cost variability and increasing modular in our mix. However, we remain optimistic that margins in 2023 will continue to trend at or slightly above the margins we achieved in 2022. SG&A expense for the quarter was $136 million or 10.5% of revenue compared to $119 million or 11.7% of revenue for the second quarter in 2022. On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $14 million due to inflation and ongoing investments to support our much higher activity levels. But the growth in our SG&A cost was considerably slower than our growth in revenue, resulting in exceptionally good SG&A leverage this quarter as compared to last year. Our operating income increased from last year by 62% to $92 million. Our operating income percentage improved to 7.1% this quarter from 5.6% for the second quarter of 2022 as electrical margins increased and as we had great SG&A leverage. We still expect interest expense in 2023 to increase from 2022. However, so far this year, our higher interest payments were partially and temporarily offset by interest income related to a favorable legal outcome in the first quarter as well as extremely strong cash flow in the first half of the year. Our year-to-date tax rate of 16.1% included an incremental benefit of $6 million or $0.15 from a conforming adjustment for the R&D tax credit, of which $0.08 related to 2022. If Congress restores immediate deductibility of research expenditures and rescind this conforming adjustment, we will have to reverse that $0.15 income statement gain in the period that this occurs. Although many individual items have affected our tax rate lately, we estimate that a normalized tax rate for us is approximately 20% to 22%. After considering all these factors, net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $69 million or $1.93 per share, and this compares to net income for the second quarter of 2022 of $42 million or $1.17 per share. EBITDA increased from $77 million in the second quarter of last year to $112 million this quarter, an increase of 45%. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2023 was a remarkable $213 million. And I want to take a few minutes to discuss 4 factors that are impacting our cash flow and have helped us achieve much higher cash flow than net income, but which will also create more variability than usual in our cash flow results over the next few quarters. Two of the factors have been helping cash flow and 2 of the factors are creating cash flow headwinds. The first positive driver is very straightforward. We are achieving profitability that's fantastic and we're able to obtain fair and favorable payment terms across our book of business. The second positive factor helping our cash flow is the fact that we received large advanced payments in the first half of 2023 and in late 2022 for some modular projects as a result of our commitment to add capacity. We also currently have some customer cash relating to large and ongoing equipment purchases. Although we continue to benefit from these advanced payments, this benefit will normalize as project costs are incurred. We estimate that the advanced payments received in late 2022 and the first 6 months of 2023, currently aggregate to $175 million to $200 million. So in other words, we currently have around $200 million of cash that we have not earned. As these early collections normalize, a substantial portion of this money will be reduced from ongoing cash flow because we already have the money. The first negative factor affecting our cash flow is the extra taxes we are paying as a result of the deferral of tax deductions for research expenditures. So far this year, we have disbursed approximately $80 million in tax payments that would not have been made under the prior regulation. Unless Congress acts to restore current deductibility, we expect to make additional tax payments during the last 6 months of 2023 of $50 million to $60 million as the deductible of those business cost is spread over the next 5 years. The fourth and final factor impacting our cash flow is temporarily heightened capital expenditures as we build out 1 million square feet of new modular capacity and as we purchase more vehicles as a result of reduced vehicle availability during COVID. Year-to-date, we had $39 million of net capital expenditures, double what we spent in the same period the prior year, and we expect this higher expenditure level will continue in the second half of 2023. So during the first half of this year, the 2 positive factors I just described overwhelmed the 2 negative factors. However, as those advanced payments amortize into a more normal cadence and as we fund our equipment commitments, free cash flow might be lower than you might otherwise expect over the next few quarters. Our debt was lower at quarter end as our substantial free cash flow allowed us to reduce our debt by $109 million since year-end, in addition to funding the purchase of Eldeco in the first quarter. We also continue to purchase our shares, acquiring 53,000 shares at an average price of $126.89 in the first half of the year and adding to the over 10 million shares we've repurchased since 2007. Finally, as Brian noted, we implemented another meaningful dividend increase this quarter.  That's all I have, Brian.\nBrian Lane : All right. Thanks, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our business and outlook. Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was $4.2 billion. Since last year at this time, our same-store backlog has increased $1.4 billion, around 50% with increases in our traditional mechanical and electrical business and substantial new bookings in our offsite construction operations. Our sequential backlog decreased by $259 million, with most of that reflecting the good progress we are making on the prebookings in our modular business. Excluding modular, our backlog was roughly flat despite a heavy midyear burn rate. Our revenue mix continues to trend towards industrial work, and industrial customers were 52% of our total revenue in the first half of 2023. Data centers, life sciences, food processing and other manufacturing such as chip plants and battery are major drivers of new prospects in backlog. Technology, which is included in Industrial, was 20% of our revenue in the first 6 months of 2023, a substantial increase from 12% in the prior year. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government are also strong and represent 28% of our revenue. The commercial sector is active but with our changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 20% of revenue, and commercial is disproportionately service revenue. Year-to-date, construction was 80% of our revenue with projects for new buildings at 53%, while existing building construction was 27%. Service revenue increased by 16% year-to-date compared to last year. Service was 20% of our total revenues, with service projects providing 9% of total revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 11% of revenue. In both service and construction, we are encouraging and supporting our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their businesses, buildings and operations, and we are committed to being good members of the diverse communities we serve. Comfort Systems is thriving because of our best-in-class people and their superb execution. Thanks to them and in light of the enduring need for the unique skills and capabilities we feel confident in our prospects for continued growth and strong profitability in 2023. Our #1 priority remains to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry. We are grateful for their and your trust. I want to end by thanking our over 15,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Valerie for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc.\nSean Eastman : Team, nice quarter. I wanted to just dive into the backlog trend a little bit. It's very helpful to know that excluding modular, which had the big prebookings dynamic, the backlog is pretty flat, and that's actually pretty bullish and a heavy burn quarter. I think that's very helpful. But perhaps you could comment on just the overall bid activity, the proposal dialogue, how that's trended maybe since the start of the year? And perhaps give you guys an opportunity to set an expectation on how this modular burn and how optically the backlog might trend over the balance of the year?\nBrian Lane: All right, Sean, this is Brian. I'll go first, and I'll let Bill comment a little bit more on modular. As you noted and we noted in our formal words that we had big preorders and we're operating through that work right now. The opportunities in the markets are still very robust. And as you know, we're a little bit different now. We do have bigger projects. It's going to be lumpier. So you might have some quarter-to-quarter pluses and minuses. But the overall trend that we're seeing from a demand environment is still very good. We are still making sure we're looking for good work with good margins in it. That's really in our wheelhouse. So we're still very optimistic and feel very good about the position that we're in. Bill?\nBill George : Yes. So I'll just talk about modular for a second. Modular, the difference is -- our entire book of business is doing amazingly well. But at the margin, the interesting things you see in the quarter are heavily driven by modular. So modular booked $800 million of work in a week in December. They had additional prebookings in January. And now they're burning that they're building those -- that equipment. And keeping in mind the new million square feet of space hasn't even come online yet, so that will burn quicker. They have a very, very good order flow and the they're evaluating how much more of that work they can take. It's also really affected our cash because when we took those big prebookings, we had the right to some of that works not even until '24, but we had the right to build a notable portion of it and be paid that immediately. That was part of them inducing us to add that capacity. So it's added some lumpiness but as Brian said, we've never had stronger demand characteristics in our business than we're experiencing right now.\nSean Eastman : I think that's all very helpful. And just as we think through the go-forward growth potential on top line, we have a few different moving parts to consider. We have inflation abating. We've got tight capacity. But then we also have this massive backlog growth trend. So I'm just trying to piece all those together. I mean is there any way you can help us think through those and what a good way to think about kind of next year's organic revenue potential could be how much visibility you have on what that would look like into next year at this point?\nBill George : So you've sort of nailed the bigger than usual variability in there, especially the price of the revenue that's a pass through, generally a pass-through for us, like materials and equipment. But if we sort of assume out a way and we can assume that a way and say, \"Listen, we're not going to assume deflation in that area, but we're going to sue much, much less normal inflation, meaning next to no inflation.\" I still think we would expect to be -- have higher revenues for sure in '24 than in '23, just in light of our backlog and our pipeline and the demand. That is going to, to a certain extent, be held back by our guys. Like we have a fantastic workforce. They have been working very hard for a few years. Human beings can only do so much. We're growing our workforce, but we play a long game at Comfort. We've had growth and positive cash flow for 20 years. And we're not going to -- we're trying to take work that's favorable to our guys that has favorable locations, that have reasonable GCs who don't run a miserable project. Our focus right now is build and preserve that workforce and the long term -- the things we need to do in the long term to do that is what's going to really benefit our shareholders. Having said that, the demand is so great, it's almost irresistible.\nSean Eastman : Okay. And then last one for me. It's nice to see the revenue outlook being taken up for 2023 but you guys are standing by this gross margin at or near 2022 levels. So I guess I was just curious to me because we're running above 2022 levels in the first half and I can't really think of a reason why we should be down year-over-year gross margin in the second half. But maybe you tell me, perhaps there's a tough comp on margins as well in the second half?\nBill George : Well, one thing, just to correct what you said. We actually said in our prepared remarks that we expected to trend at or above, slightly above the margins And how far above. That's a lot of work between here and when we know that.\nBrian Lane: But Sean, thanks for helping us correct that also we're performing at a very high level right now in the field. We couldn't have some more than we're getting from these folks right now.\nSean Eastman : Okay. Great. So I mean everything is going great. Execution is good, and we\u2019re looking at least a little bit better than we would have thought before on margins in addition to the stronger revenue outlook. So thanks for clarifying. And I\u2019ll turn it over there. Thanks a lot, team.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julio Romero of Sidoti.\nJulio Romero : I wanted to talk about the SG&A leverage you're seeing in the model. It's really impressive. How do you -- what's going on there? And how do you expect SG&A as a percentage of sales to trend for the remainder of the year?\nBill George : So we're optimistic that we can hold it at the levels that we had at the first half, which, of course, are unprecedented for us. As a percent of revenue, our SG&A has never been lower. Part of what's driving that is service -- even though service has grown every single quarter since you -- long before you were an analyst and our service profits have grown, they just aren't growing as fast as construction and construction has lower SG&A. It's really impressive. If you think about that SG&A leverage, people think, oh, you control your cost. But in reality, all we really did was held our gross margins as we grew and didn't add as much cost. And that we certainly hope to continue to do that. But at the level where our goal is to just hold these levels we're at. Now the risk to gross -- to the SG&A as a percent of revenue would be that revenue, let's say, there's some deflation in some of the big equipment, which is selling for a lot more today than it sold for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 years ago in any way you want to look at it. Here's the thing, though. If that happens, our gross margin should go up, right? Because our materials as a percent of cost of goods sold are like in the 40% low mid-digit range, 43%, 42%, 44%. And historically, they're about 1/3 of our costs. So if they go down even a little bit, that you'd see our SG&A tick up a little, but you want to see our gross margins make up for or possibly more than make up for that. So just it's a hard moment to predict that because there's that big elephant in the room of cost that passed through us.\nJulio Romero : Yes. No, that totally makes sense about the service business not growing to the extent of the construction business and that affects the SG&A. I really appreciate that explanation there. Maybe you could talk about the service business, the trends you're seeing there? And I guess, could service maybe outgrow construction in 2024, just given the tough comps that construction would have?\nBrian Lane: So it's Brian, Julio, if you look at service in general, we've tripled it over the last 10 years, doubled it over the last 5. We'll continue to get good solid growth, but a slow incremental growth that's very consistent in service. for it to outpace construction in 2023, 2024, I don't believe that will happen. I think it will still grow. But these construction markets are still very strong this year and next year. So we will get more growth out of construction than we will out of service.\nJulio Romero : Okay. Great. And then just last one for me is just maybe talk about if artificial intelligence is kind of driving any newer activity within data centers lately? And is it just the hyperscalers or are there others out there at the moment?\nBill George : So there was an already big demand for data centers has gone up a lot. So the answer is, of course, yes, absolutely. It's not just driving the number of projects, it's driving the value of the projects. These new servers can burn 2, 3, 4x hotter. And guess what, we're in the cooling business. So it's really advantageous for us.\nBrian Lane: And also the electrical demand is in the same range, 2 to 4x more requirements. So is this more work for us to do in each of these buildings, Julio.\nBill George : The other thing that happens is that buildings become even more technically complex and hard to execute, which pushes people towards us, right, because we have the big workforces, the very, very capable people are much less likely to think cheap and cheerful right now.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Chan of UBS.\nJoshua Chan : Brian, Bill and Julie, congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to ask about the project outlook, I guess, basically projects that are even beyond your backlog, what you're seeing across the different end markets of work that you're possibly preparing to bid on?\nBill George : So it's still never been better. Right now, there's more work, we're turning away work. That's why we're able to be picky about trying to find work that's good for our people and it's never been better. It's the amount of demand, you are -- so you have -- we're over 50% industrial, right? So on the technology side, you have data center demand that's really taken another leg up from already a strong positioning. And then you've got totally new sources of demand. We're deployed very heavily on 2 of the largest silicon manufacturer projects in the United States. Battery is starting to roll revenue through more. And then you've got really good manufacturing. You've got really good pharma. You've got -- it's just extraordinary. The offshoring hurt us for 15 or 20 years, and restoring feels like it's got legs right now.\nJoshua Chan : That's good to hear. And then on the modular business, could you remind us when the million square foot capacity comes online and kind of your time line of completing the large order and when you might be able to assume newer orders on the module side?\nBill George : So we may have some production in that space by the end of the third quarter, but if so, in one of the 2 new spaces, so it won't even be detectable. By the middle of the fourth quarter, we should have at least some production in both of the new big buildings. We are still -- our prospects for additional bookings in modular like every other part of our business. They've never been better. We have conversations. Right now, we have orders we could take that we are waiting to make sure we can execute on what we have, quite honestly.\nBrian Lane: Josh, the larger projects, it's all about the time you could have won one in the middle of June, right, that's going to come into July. So on the larger work, time is different than it is on the smaller work would be quickly awarded. The bigger ones just take a little bit longer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: I guess, Brian or Bill, can you just maybe talk about some of the discussions you're having with customers on the modular side? Are there similar order opportunities out there like you saw kind of late in 2022 that might be additive over the course of the next 12-plus months?\nBill George : So we can only talk a certain amount about that, right? But our single largest customer that we've done work with since really before we bought really either of the 2 companies that do modular for us. So it's one case, more than 10 years. We're looking at ways to adapt their scope so that we can do more for them and also leave good work for contractors. We have new orders that we're in design on for a new major customer and quite honestly, we're in conversations, we've been visited by others. But frankly, we're capacity constrained for the foreseeable future, right? And we're going to -- the people who've been good to us forever, we have to take care of them and give them -- make sure we give them what they need because they treat us well. But we're absolutely out there developing -- really, for all of these especially on the data center side for all of these people, it's all of the above strategy. they want to build modular. They want to build -- they built...\nBrian Lane: They're doing it all.\nBill George : They're doing for that what we're doing for hiring people. And that is everything we can think of.\nBrian Lane: It's amazing how many opportunities are Altea just in the state of Texas, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: Got it. Maybe just sticking with modular, how much of an impact is that? It sounds like it's ramped up a lot here maybe in the quarter or first half, much of an impact is that having on your margins in mechanical?\nBill George : So their margins are slightly lower than the average of our mechanical margins. Their margins per dollar spend on labor are as good or better, right? They use a less skilled on average, less very skilled, but not as skilled as journey out in the field labor force. But no, I mean, they average our margins down as far as how much. It's in the tens of basis points because they're still as big as they are, the rest of Comfort still forfeits to the business, right?\nBrent Thielman: Okay. I guess lastly, Bill, I mean, $6 in free cash flow through the first half, caught all the comments about the moving pieces attached to that. I think you're telling us don't expect to repeat of that, but is it feasible that you could still do it because second half of the year tends to be a pretty strong cash generation for you historically speaking?\nBill George : So it would take a new prebooking to maintain this. It would take -- and most likely, if that were to come, it would not come in time for us to collect the money. We literally have $200 million we haven't earned. That is a lot of money. And it's only good news, right? The fact that we have those relationships with our customers, and they understand the kind of risks we take for them, but you can't earn the same money twice. So we just -- you know us, like we just want to be perfectly clear with people about what's happening, right? We made it clear to people when we got the prebookings that was going to be lumpy and there'd be a quarter or 2 where there'd be some normalization of that, and we want to make it clear that all this advanced cash we're getting has to normalize over time. We still have -- you can collect money early, but you can't collect it twice.\nBrent Thielman: Right. Just last one. Maybe just if you could talk about the implications of the heat waves you all experienced where you're at but seems like it's hit a lot of the markets that you have operations and what does that mean for the company?\nBrian Lane: Well, we -- as you can imagine, it is hot a lot of places from a work perspective, right, 100% utilization, if not more. If anybody living in these places, try to get some of the company a house. So we don't -- it's just very difficult. But -- so the implication for us really is the health and safety of our workers, making sure they're seeing hydrated regulating new work because it is -- down here in the South, it is really hard, Brent. So we can really -- there's plenty of work for them to do. We just want to make sure that we take care of them for the long term. That's the bigger implication. There's plenty of work out there. That's not the problem.\nBrent Thielman: Got you. Brian, is that driving outsized contributions from service as well?\nBrian Lane: Yes. Service is fully utilized, fully capacity working weekends, you just got to make sure you take him so you don't run them into the ground. Some of these folks are on roofs down in Texas, you're probably talking 120, 130 degrees on those roofs, same in Arizona. So you just got to be careful how much you're working them and what the conditions are, but it is driving a lot of work, a lot of repair work, et cetera, as you would imagine.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thomson Davis.\nAdam Thalhimer : Bill, I just wanted to confirm the revenue targets that you gave, those were organic, right? They do not include Eldeco?\nBill George : Yes, they're organic. I've always said it's a fantastic company, but percentage-wise, they get was $30 million in the quarter. So -- but no, those are organic. But it's a rounding error indifference.\nAdam Thalhimer : And then well, I was hoping you could comment on 2024 revenue because well, you guys kind of brought it up in terms of having some visibility and just playing around with the model last night. I don't really know where to set that as a start.\nBill George : So I expect 2024 revenue will be larger than 2023 revenue. I think if you keep the margins close to the same, you can count on some growth. If you don't show growth, you should expect our margins to get higher. So the problem is it's not an independent variable, right, because it changes really the operative part of it is mix.\nBrian Lane: Yes. I mean we already have a significant amount of work for 2024 already, Adam. So we're looking at 2025 in some cases. So we're feeling good about 2024 for July for sure.\nAdam Thalhimer : Okay. But Bill, I guess, if you have the opinion that the revenue growth is going to decelerate then you get a little bit more optimistic about margins?\nBill George : 100%.\nAdam Thalhimer : Got you. And then what do we do with CapEx going forward? When does this -- and I thought it was one modular facility, you said too. But when do those stop constructing?\nBill George : So it's 400,000-plus square feet in North Carolina and 600,000-plus square feet in Texas. The money for those build-outs should be substantially fully funded by the end of the year. I think vehicle catch-up actually has really got a long way to go. So if we were we're bigger now, but I would say we're 2 years from getting back to our traditional level of CapEx that you know, and we'd probably get halfway back there next year, we'll be down sort of halfway back to normal. So it's doubled now, maybe from its long-term trends. It's 150% of its long-term trends next year, and it's back to normal by the following year. That's obviously just a guess, but it's -- and keep in mind, CapEx is so small for us, right? We're such an asset-light business that it's not going to drive your model on the cash side.\nAdam Thalhimer : Perfect. And then just lastly, does the margin profile of the business changed at all as the revenue shifts more to modular? I'm just thinking over multiple years.\nBill George : So the gross margin -- yes, I would say, if you were just to freeze everything and say, \"Hey, freeze everything, but double modular.\" What you would see is materials as a percent of cost of goods sold would be higher. And you would see gross margins would be lower and SG&A would be lower. And we'd make a lot -- yes, we make a lot of money. Yes, we make a lot of money. One way to look at the productivity of modular, people get concerned that it has slightly lower gross margin. And the reality is the margin per dollar of labor is as good or better than anything we have and think about that because it's pretty damn good in the rest of our business, right? So you just -- you have to -- these are not the same businesses. they have different characteristics, cost characteristics. There is a lot of material, steel, chillers, generators going into those things we're building in those plants.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Brian Lane for any closing remarks.\nBrian Lane : Okay. Thank you, Valerie. In closing, I want once again to thank all our amazing employees. I hope everybody takes care of themselves out there. And everybody else, I hope you have a great rest of your summer and we look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for all participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

            "content": "All right. Thank you, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We had another great quarter. Our teams delivered remarkable execution, and we are grateful for their dedication, especially in this very hot weather. We have never had a stronger demand environment, and we are carefully selecting work that has good margins and good working conditions for our valuable people. We earned $1.93 per share this quarter compared to $1.17 a year ago. Current quarter revenue was $1.3 billion with same-store growth of 24%, reflecting strong ongoing demand in our markets. Our mechanical operations continued to perform at high levels, and Electrical segment margins increased significantly. This quarter includes continued growth and solid performance in our modular business and service has maintained its upward trajectory. Additionally, our backlog continues to track at unprecedented levels despite a strong revenue for the quarter. Backlog is $4.2 billion, which is $1.4 billion higher than it was at the same time last year. Our strong execution and favorable payment terms on new work helped us achieve $100 million of cash flow in the second quarter. Today, we also increased our quarterly dividend by $0.025 to $0.225 per share, which reflects our continuing strong cash flow and our commitment to reward our shareholders. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes but first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? All right. Thanks, Bill. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing our business and outlook. Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was $4.2 billion. Since last year at this time, our same-store backlog has increased $1.4 billion, around 50% with increases in our traditional mechanical and electrical business and substantial new bookings in our offsite construction operations. Our sequential backlog decreased by $259 million, with most of that reflecting the good progress we are making on the prebookings in our modular business. Excluding modular, our backlog was roughly flat despite a heavy midyear burn rate. Our revenue mix continues to trend towards industrial work, and industrial customers were 52% of our total revenue in the first half of 2023. Data centers, life sciences, food processing and other manufacturing such as chip plants and battery are major drivers of new prospects in backlog. Technology, which is included in Industrial, was 20% of our revenue in the first 6 months of 2023, a substantial increase from 12% in the prior year. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government are also strong and represent 28% of our revenue. The commercial sector is active but with our changing mix, it is now a smaller part of our business at about 20% of revenue, and commercial is disproportionately service revenue. Year-to-date, construction was 80% of our revenue with projects for new buildings at 53%, while existing building construction was 27%. Service revenue increased by 16% year-to-date compared to last year. Service was 20% of our total revenues, with service projects providing 9% of total revenue and pure service, including hourly work, providing 11% of revenue. In both service and construction, we are encouraging and supporting our customers as they seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their businesses, buildings and operations, and we are committed to being good members of the diverse communities we serve. Comfort Systems is thriving because of our best-in-class people and their superb execution. Thanks to them and in light of the enduring need for the unique skills and capabilities we feel confident in our prospects for continued growth and strong profitability in 2023. Our #1 priority remains to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry. We are grateful for their and your trust. I want to end by thanking our over 15,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Valerie for questions. Thank you. All right, Sean, this is Brian. I'll go first, and I'll let Bill comment a little bit more on modular. As you noted and we noted in our formal words that we had big preorders and we're operating through that work right now. The opportunities in the markets are still very robust. And as you know, we're a little bit different now. We do have bigger projects. It's going to be lumpier. So you might have some quarter-to-quarter pluses and minuses. But the overall trend that we're seeing from a demand environment is still very good. We are still making sure we're looking for good work with good margins in it. That's really in our wheelhouse. So we're still very optimistic and feel very good about the position that we're in. Bill? But Sean, thanks for helping us correct that also we're performing at a very high level right now in the field. We couldn't have some more than we're getting from these folks right now. So it's Brian, Julio, if you look at service in general, we've tripled it over the last 10 years, doubled it over the last 5. We'll continue to get good solid growth, but a slow incremental growth that's very consistent in service. for it to outpace construction in 2023, 2024, I don't believe that will happen. I think it will still grow. But these construction markets are still very strong this year and next year. So we will get more growth out of construction than we will out of service. And also the electrical demand is in the same range, 2 to 4x more requirements. So is this more work for us to do in each of these buildings, Julio. Josh, the larger projects, it's all about the time you could have won one in the middle of June, right, that's going to come into July. So on the larger work, time is different than it is on the smaller work would be quickly awarded. The bigger ones just take a little bit longer. They're doing it all. It's amazing how many opportunities are Altea just in the state of Texas, Brent. Well, we -- as you can imagine, it is hot a lot of places from a work perspective, right, 100% utilization, if not more. If anybody living in these places, try to get some of the company a house. So we don't -- it's just very difficult. But -- so the implication for us really is the health and safety of our workers, making sure they're seeing hydrated regulating new work because it is -- down here in the South, it is really hard, Brent. So we can really -- there's plenty of work for them to do. We just want to make sure that we take care of them for the long term. That's the bigger implication. There's plenty of work out there. That's not the problem. Yes. Service is fully utilized, fully capacity working weekends, you just got to make sure you take him so you don't run them into the ground. Some of these folks are on roofs down in Texas, you're probably talking 120, 130 degrees on those roofs, same in Arizona. So you just got to be careful how much you're working them and what the conditions are, but it is driving a lot of work, a lot of repair work, et cetera, as you would imagine. Yes. I mean we already have a significant amount of work for 2024 already, Adam. So we're looking at 2025 in some cases. So we're feeling good about 2024 for July for sure. Okay. Thank you, Valerie. In closing, I want once again to thank all our amazing employees. I hope everybody takes care of themselves out there. And everybody else, I hope you have a great rest of your summer and we look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill George",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. We had an amazing quarter; with 24% same-store revenue growth, higher margins, SG&A leverage over $100 million of cash flow and our EBITDA increased by a remarkable 45% compared to last year. Specifically, revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was $1.3 billion, an increase of 27% or $278 million compared to last year. Our Mechanical segment revenue increased by $199 million or 26%, and it continues to benefit from growth in our modular business. Our Electrical segment increased by an even larger 33% and to $321 million. Combined same-store revenue increased by 24% or $247 million as we continue to benefit from strong demand and some pass-through effects of inflation. We are facing tougher revenue comparables in the second half of the year, and we currently estimate that revenue growth in the second half will be in the high single to low double digits and currently expect that percentage revenue growth for the full year is likely to be in the high teens. Gross profit was $228 million for the second quarter, a $53 million improvement compared to last year. Our gross profit percentage improved to 17.6% this quarter compared to 17.2% for the second quarter of 2022, driven by improved electrical margins. Quarterly gross profit percentage in our Mechanical segment was the same this year and last year at 17.8%. Margins in our Electrical segment rose in the quarter to 17.0% as compared to 15.1% in Q2 2022. It's hard to predict how margins will unfold for the remainder of 2023 and in light of material cost variability and increasing modular in our mix. However, we remain optimistic that margins in 2023 will continue to trend at or slightly above the margins we achieved in 2022. SG&A expense for the quarter was $136 million or 10.5% of revenue compared to $119 million or 11.7% of revenue for the second quarter in 2022. On a same-store basis, SG&A was up approximately $14 million due to inflation and ongoing investments to support our much higher activity levels. But the growth in our SG&A cost was considerably slower than our growth in revenue, resulting in exceptionally good SG&A leverage this quarter as compared to last year. Our operating income increased from last year by 62% to $92 million. Our operating income percentage improved to 7.1% this quarter from 5.6% for the second quarter of 2022 as electrical margins increased and as we had great SG&A leverage. We still expect interest expense in 2023 to increase from 2022. However, so far this year, our higher interest payments were partially and temporarily offset by interest income related to a favorable legal outcome in the first quarter as well as extremely strong cash flow in the first half of the year. Our year-to-date tax rate of 16.1% included an incremental benefit of $6 million or $0.15 from a conforming adjustment for the R&D tax credit, of which $0.08 related to 2022. If Congress restores immediate deductibility of research expenditures and rescind this conforming adjustment, we will have to reverse that $0.15 income statement gain in the period that this occurs. Although many individual items have affected our tax rate lately, we estimate that a normalized tax rate for us is approximately 20% to 22%. After considering all these factors, net income for the second quarter of 2023 was $69 million or $1.93 per share, and this compares to net income for the second quarter of 2022 of $42 million or $1.17 per share. EBITDA increased from $77 million in the second quarter of last year to $112 million this quarter, an increase of 45%. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2023 was a remarkable $213 million. And I want to take a few minutes to discuss 4 factors that are impacting our cash flow and have helped us achieve much higher cash flow than net income, but which will also create more variability than usual in our cash flow results over the next few quarters. Two of the factors have been helping cash flow and 2 of the factors are creating cash flow headwinds. The first positive driver is very straightforward. We are achieving profitability that's fantastic and we're able to obtain fair and favorable payment terms across our book of business. The second positive factor helping our cash flow is the fact that we received large advanced payments in the first half of 2023 and in late 2022 for some modular projects as a result of our commitment to add capacity. We also currently have some customer cash relating to large and ongoing equipment purchases. Although we continue to benefit from these advanced payments, this benefit will normalize as project costs are incurred. We estimate that the advanced payments received in late 2022 and the first 6 months of 2023, currently aggregate to $175 million to $200 million. So in other words, we currently have around $200 million of cash that we have not earned. As these early collections normalize, a substantial portion of this money will be reduced from ongoing cash flow because we already have the money. The first negative factor affecting our cash flow is the extra taxes we are paying as a result of the deferral of tax deductions for research expenditures. So far this year, we have disbursed approximately $80 million in tax payments that would not have been made under the prior regulation. Unless Congress acts to restore current deductibility, we expect to make additional tax payments during the last 6 months of 2023 of $50 million to $60 million as the deductible of those business cost is spread over the next 5 years. The fourth and final factor impacting our cash flow is temporarily heightened capital expenditures as we build out 1 million square feet of new modular capacity and as we purchase more vehicles as a result of reduced vehicle availability during COVID. Year-to-date, we had $39 million of net capital expenditures, double what we spent in the same period the prior year, and we expect this higher expenditure level will continue in the second half of 2023. So during the first half of this year, the 2 positive factors I just described overwhelmed the 2 negative factors. However, as those advanced payments amortize into a more normal cadence and as we fund our equipment commitments, free cash flow might be lower than you might otherwise expect over the next few quarters. Our debt was lower at quarter end as our substantial free cash flow allowed us to reduce our debt by $109 million since year-end, in addition to funding the purchase of Eldeco in the first quarter. We also continue to purchase our shares, acquiring 53,000 shares at an average price of $126.89 in the first half of the year and adding to the over 10 million shares we've repurchased since 2007. Finally, as Brian noted, we implemented another meaningful dividend increase this quarter.  That's all I have, Brian. Yes. So I'll just talk about modular for a second. Modular, the difference is -- our entire book of business is doing amazingly well. But at the margin, the interesting things you see in the quarter are heavily driven by modular. So modular booked $800 million of work in a week in December. They had additional prebookings in January. And now they're burning that they're building those -- that equipment. And keeping in mind the new million square feet of space hasn't even come online yet, so that will burn quicker. They have a very, very good order flow and the they're evaluating how much more of that work they can take. It's also really affected our cash because when we took those big prebookings, we had the right to some of that works not even until '24, but we had the right to build a notable portion of it and be paid that immediately. That was part of them inducing us to add that capacity. So it's added some lumpiness but as Brian said, we've never had stronger demand characteristics in our business than we're experiencing right now. So you've sort of nailed the bigger than usual variability in there, especially the price of the revenue that's a pass through, generally a pass-through for us, like materials and equipment. But if we sort of assume out a way and we can assume that a way and say, \"Listen, we're not going to assume deflation in that area, but we're going to sue much, much less normal inflation, meaning next to no inflation.\" I still think we would expect to be -- have higher revenues for sure in '24 than in '23, just in light of our backlog and our pipeline and the demand. That is going to, to a certain extent, be held back by our guys. Like we have a fantastic workforce. They have been working very hard for a few years. Human beings can only do so much. We're growing our workforce, but we play a long game at Comfort. We've had growth and positive cash flow for 20 years. And we're not going to -- we're trying to take work that's favorable to our guys that has favorable locations, that have reasonable GCs who don't run a miserable project. Our focus right now is build and preserve that workforce and the long term -- the things we need to do in the long term to do that is what's going to really benefit our shareholders. Having said that, the demand is so great, it's almost irresistible. Well, one thing, just to correct what you said. We actually said in our prepared remarks that we expected to trend at or above, slightly above the margins And how far above. That's a lot of work between here and when we know that. So we're optimistic that we can hold it at the levels that we had at the first half, which, of course, are unprecedented for us. As a percent of revenue, our SG&A has never been lower. Part of what's driving that is service -- even though service has grown every single quarter since you -- long before you were an analyst and our service profits have grown, they just aren't growing as fast as construction and construction has lower SG&A. It's really impressive. If you think about that SG&A leverage, people think, oh, you control your cost. But in reality, all we really did was held our gross margins as we grew and didn't add as much cost. And that we certainly hope to continue to do that. But at the level where our goal is to just hold these levels we're at. Now the risk to gross -- to the SG&A as a percent of revenue would be that revenue, let's say, there's some deflation in some of the big equipment, which is selling for a lot more today than it sold for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 years ago in any way you want to look at it. Here's the thing, though. If that happens, our gross margin should go up, right? Because our materials as a percent of cost of goods sold are like in the 40% low mid-digit range, 43%, 42%, 44%. And historically, they're about 1/3 of our costs. So if they go down even a little bit, that you'd see our SG&A tick up a little, but you want to see our gross margins make up for or possibly more than make up for that. So just it's a hard moment to predict that because there's that big elephant in the room of cost that passed through us. So there was an already big demand for data centers has gone up a lot. So the answer is, of course, yes, absolutely. It's not just driving the number of projects, it's driving the value of the projects. These new servers can burn 2, 3, 4x hotter. And guess what, we're in the cooling business. So it's really advantageous for us. The other thing that happens is that buildings become even more technically complex and hard to execute, which pushes people towards us, right, because we have the big workforces, the very, very capable people are much less likely to think cheap and cheerful right now. So it's still never been better. Right now, there's more work, we're turning away work. That's why we're able to be picky about trying to find work that's good for our people and it's never been better. It's the amount of demand, you are -- so you have -- we're over 50% industrial, right? So on the technology side, you have data center demand that's really taken another leg up from already a strong positioning. And then you've got totally new sources of demand. We're deployed very heavily on 2 of the largest silicon manufacturer projects in the United States. Battery is starting to roll revenue through more. And then you've got really good manufacturing. You've got really good pharma. You've got -- it's just extraordinary. The offshoring hurt us for 15 or 20 years, and restoring feels like it's got legs right now. So we may have some production in that space by the end of the third quarter, but if so, in one of the 2 new spaces, so it won't even be detectable. By the middle of the fourth quarter, we should have at least some production in both of the new big buildings. We are still -- our prospects for additional bookings in modular like every other part of our business. They've never been better. We have conversations. Right now, we have orders we could take that we are waiting to make sure we can execute on what we have, quite honestly. So we can only talk a certain amount about that, right? But our single largest customer that we've done work with since really before we bought really either of the 2 companies that do modular for us. So it's one case, more than 10 years. We're looking at ways to adapt their scope so that we can do more for them and also leave good work for contractors. We have new orders that we're in design on for a new major customer and quite honestly, we're in conversations, we've been visited by others. But frankly, we're capacity constrained for the foreseeable future, right? And we're going to -- the people who've been good to us forever, we have to take care of them and give them -- make sure we give them what they need because they treat us well. But we're absolutely out there developing -- really, for all of these especially on the data center side for all of these people, it's all of the above strategy. they want to build modular. They want to build -- they built... They're doing for that what we're doing for hiring people. And that is everything we can think of. So their margins are slightly lower than the average of our mechanical margins. Their margins per dollar spend on labor are as good or better, right? They use a less skilled on average, less very skilled, but not as skilled as journey out in the field labor force. But no, I mean, they average our margins down as far as how much. It's in the tens of basis points because they're still as big as they are, the rest of Comfort still forfeits to the business, right? So it would take a new prebooking to maintain this. It would take -- and most likely, if that were to come, it would not come in time for us to collect the money. We literally have $200 million we haven't earned. That is a lot of money. And it's only good news, right? The fact that we have those relationships with our customers, and they understand the kind of risks we take for them, but you can't earn the same money twice. So we just -- you know us, like we just want to be perfectly clear with people about what's happening, right? We made it clear to people when we got the prebookings that was going to be lumpy and there'd be a quarter or 2 where there'd be some normalization of that, and we want to make it clear that all this advanced cash we're getting has to normalize over time. We still have -- you can collect money early, but you can't collect it twice. Yes, they're organic. I've always said it's a fantastic company, but percentage-wise, they get was $30 million in the quarter. So -- but no, those are organic. But it's a rounding error indifference. So I expect 2024 revenue will be larger than 2023 revenue. I think if you keep the margins close to the same, you can count on some growth. If you don't show growth, you should expect our margins to get higher. So the problem is it's not an independent variable, right, because it changes really the operative part of it is mix. 100%. So it's 400,000-plus square feet in North Carolina and 600,000-plus square feet in Texas. The money for those build-outs should be substantially fully funded by the end of the year. I think vehicle catch-up actually has really got a long way to go. So if we were we're bigger now, but I would say we're 2 years from getting back to our traditional level of CapEx that you know, and we'd probably get halfway back there next year, we'll be down sort of halfway back to normal. So it's doubled now, maybe from its long-term trends. It's 150% of its long-term trends next year, and it's back to normal by the following year. That's obviously just a guess, but it's -- and keep in mind, CapEx is so small for us, right? We're such an asset-light business that it's not going to drive your model on the cash side. So the gross margin -- yes, I would say, if you were just to freeze everything and say, \"Hey, freeze everything, but double modular.\" What you would see is materials as a percent of cost of goods sold would be higher. And you would see gross margins would be lower and SG&A would be lower. And we'd make a lot -- yes, we make a lot of money. Yes, we make a lot of money. One way to look at the productivity of modular, people get concerned that it has slightly lower gross margin. And the reality is the margin per dollar of labor is as good or better than anything we have and think about that because it's pretty damn good in the rest of our business, right? So you just -- you have to -- these are not the same businesses. they have different characteristics, cost characteristics. There is a lot of material, steel, chillers, generators going into those things we're building in those plants."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Rica [ph]. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's first quarter 2023 earnings call. Our comments today, as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws and regulation. What we will say today is based upon the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. The presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We have had a great beginning to 2023 with increased revenue and pre-tax earnings, unusually strong cash flow, and another increase in backlog. Our teams delivered amazing execution and we are very grateful for their hard work. Excluding the private tax gain that Bill will discuss in a few minutes, we are in $1.51 per share and that included $0.15 related to the favorable resolution of certain claims related disputes. Current year revenue was $1.2 billion and unprecedented same-store revenue growth of 30%. Our backlog is now over $4.4 billion, which is a same-store increase of $1.6 billion or 58% from a year ago. Our backlog growth is tangible evidence of the ongoing demand and traditional and modular construction. Cash flow this quarter was exceptional. This morning, we also increased our dividend by $0.025 per share to $0.20 per share. This increase reflects our continuing strong cash flow and our commitment to reward our shareholders. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes. But first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George: Thanks Brian. So revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was $1.2 billion, an increase of $289 million or 33% compared to last year. Our mechanical services segment revenue increased $236 million or 35% and our electrical services segment increased by 26% to $200 -- or 236 million. Thanks to our revenue increased by 30% or $265 million with remaining $24 million increase resulting from acquisitions. Our revenue growth resulted from increased activity combined with the past-through effects of inflation including higher costs for equipment and materials. The same-store percentage increase is influenced by the fact that first quarter revenue last year was lower than the rest of the year. And we will compound much higher prior year revenue comparables over the next few quarters. So our percentage growth is unlikely to remain at these levels. Revenue trends have a lot of moving pieces. But overall, we now expect full year same-store revenue growth percentage for 2023 to finish the year in the mid teens. Gross profit was $205 million for the first quarter, a $52 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage was 17.5% this quarter compared to 17.3% for the year first quarter in 2022, including the benefit from strong wins on claims that Brian mentioned. Quarterly gross profit percentage and our mechanical segment declined from 18.6% in 2022 to 17.9% in 2023. That revenue -- that decline is largely driven by the relative growth in modular construction as a portion of our revenue. Modular construction has lower gross profit margins than build construction, and then our service businesses. Margins in the electrical segment rose to 16.1% this year from 13.0% in 2022. It is currently challenging to predict how our margins will unfold for the remainder of 2023. Important factors that will influence our margins include increases in materials intensive modular and new construction, ongoing cost inflation, and the fact that with the surge in bookings, we continue to be early in many projects. Modular is also growing as a proportion of our revenue, and we are managing ramp up considerations as we bring that new modular capacity online. Despite these structural trends that might put some pressure on margins we expect good continued profitability and we are optimistic that overall our margins in 2023 will be at or near the strong levels that we achieved in 2022 on higher revenue. SG&A expense for the quarter was $135 million or 11.5% of revenue compared to $118 million or 13.3% of revenue for the first quarter in 2022. On the same-store basis, SG&A was approximately $1.4 million due to inflation, and ongoing investments to support our much higher activity levels. Our operating income roughly doubled, increasing by 99% in the first quarter of 2023 to $71 million compared to the quarter last year. We still expect interest expense in 2023 to increase from 2022. However this quarter, the higher interest expense was partially and temporarily offset by an increase in interest income related to a favorable legal outcome. Our tax rate for the quarter was 13.1%. This included an incremental benefit of $5 million or $0.12 from a conforming adjustment for the R&D tax credit of which $0.08 related to 2022. If Congress restores immediate deductibility of research expenditures and rescind this conforming adjustment, we will have to reverse that $0.12 income statement gain in the period that this occurs. Although many individual items have affected our tax rate lately, we continue to estimate that a normalized tax rate is approximately 21% to 23%. After considering all the factors above, net income for the first quarter of 2023 was $57 million or $1.59 per share. When comparing EPS to last year, it is important to recall that in the first quarter of last year, we booked a massive incremental $1.49 per share tax gain that was related to prior years. With those gains removed from both years, our first quarter 2023 earnings per share was $1.51 as compared to $0.91 in the prior year. And on that basis, our quarterly EPS increased 66% with about a fourth of that increase coming from our positive claim outcomes. Another way of looking at the year-over-year profitability comparison without tax complications is to simply compare our EBITDA, which increased 49% from last year to $90 million. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2023 was $111 million. The main driver of this outperformance was advanced billings and deferred revenue as we benefited from favorable upfront payment terms upon receipt of large orders. The benefit from these advanced payments will reverse as project costs are incurred, except to the extent that additional advanced payments are received. So please note the following. We're facing a large cash flow headwind in the coming quarters as a result of Congress's ongoing failure to extend the current deductibility of research expenditures. Unless current expensing is restored, we will make additional tax payments during the last nine months of 2023 of approximately $120 million to $140 million, because the deductibility of a large portion of our business costs will be spread over the next five years. Also capital expenditures will be higher than usual this year as we add over 1 million square feet to our modular capacity and as we purchase vehicles at a higher than usual rate, resulting from deferrals and vehicle availability during COVID. This quarter we had $ 17 million of capital expenditures, which is an 80% increase compared to the prior year. Overall, we estimate that our CapEx spend in 2023 will be roughly $60 million to $70 million. Our debt was lower at quarter as our substantial free cash flow allowed us to reduce debt by $47 million and even fund the purchase of Eldeco from cash received during the quarter. We also continued to purchase our shares, acquiring 29,000 shares at an average price of $121.36 in the first quarter and adding to the over 10 million shares we have repurchased since 2007 at an average price of $24.80. As Brian noted, we implemented another meaningful dividend increase this quarter as well. That's all I have got with financials, Brian.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thank you, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. And I will also comment on our outlook for the rest of 2023. Our backlog at the end of the first quarter was a record $4.4 billion. Since last year this time, our same-store a backlog has increased by $1.6 billion or 58% with increases in our traditional mechanical and electrical business and substantial new bookings and our off site construction operations, where we are continuing to invest in new capacity. During the first three months of 2023, our same-store backlog increased $300 million despite heavy backlog burn in the first quarter. With a number of advanced bookings, our backlog will burn over a longer period and include audits that will be produced in 2024. Industrial customers were 51% of total revenue in the first quarter. This is the first time that industrial customers were the source of more than 50% of Comfort [ph] volume. This sector, which includes technology, life sciences, and food processing, remain strong for us as industrial is a major driver of new backlog. Starting this year, we are breaking out technology in our industrial revenue and technology with 19% of our revenue in the first quarter is substantial increase from 11% in the prior year. Institutional markets which include education, health care and government are also strong and represent 28% of our revenue. The commercial sector is active. But without changing mix, it is now a small part of our business and about 21% of revenue, much of that concentrated in our service revenue. Construction, with 80% of our revenue this quarter, with construction projects for new buildings at 54% while construction projects in existing buildings was 26%. Service grew rapidly this quarter as revenue increased by 21% compared to last year and virtually all of this increase was same-store. Service was 20% of our total revenues with service projects providing 9% of revenue and pure service including hourly work, providing 11% of revenue. We just published our annual sustainability report and in addition to the actions that we are taking in our business, we continue to encourage and support our customers as they focus on the efficiency and sustainability of their buildings and operations. Before I close, I want to briefly point out a few things about certain trends in our business. As noted earlier, construction this quarter is now 80% of our revenue, which means that over the last several years service has declined on a percentage basis as a proportion of our overall business. This is not because service is underperforming. To the absolute contrary, service was up over 20% just this quarter. In fact, our overall service business today is twice as large as it was in 2016. Construction has just increased even more. Also, when looking at the increasing share of our business than industrial and technology represents, you might ask yourself if other sectors are declining. In fact, when you look at absolute volumes as opposed to percentages, this quarter, every one of our sectors actually increased. Comfort Systems is thriving in nearly every possible way. And that is because of our teams across the country continue their superb execution. Thanks to that excellence, and then later the strong ongoing demand that we are experiencing, we remain optimistic about our prospects for continued growth and strong profitability in 2023. Our number one priority remains to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry, so we can continue our legacy of investing to meet the needs of our customers and our communities. We are grateful for their and your trust. I want to end by thanking our over 14,000 employees for their hard work and their dedication. I'll turn it back over to Rica for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julio Romero of Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.\nJulio Romero: Thanks. Hey, good morning. Maybe starting on the backlog, if you could speak to the organic sales growth you saw on the backlog quarter-over-quarter. And what type of customers or activity type were the drivers? Was it all just modular? Or were there other drivers there?\nBrian Lane: Yes. I'll go first. And then Bill can follow up. But anyway, good morning, Julio. And its broad based increase in backlog quite frankly, coast-to-coast, obviously we had strong performance out of technology. But we're getting it in multi sectors. It just not one or one part of the country. So it's still very active out there. And we don't see it stopping in the short-term for sure.\nBill George: Yes, Julio, we got a nice order from a new customer in modular this quarter. But the majority of our backlog increase within the sequential backlog increase was broad-based. And it really just where you'd want it to be in a lot of our most successful companies.\nJulio Romero: Got it that's helpful. And then maybe turning to the cash flow, second straight quarter of very strong cash flow, but you talk about the uncertainty you have there for the next nine months or so. How are you managing through that uncertainty? And does that affect anything regarding to CapEx, your M&A pipeline or cash usage?\nBill George: That's one of the great things about having a fantastically strong balance sheet. We float $111 million of cash this quarter. So, it's very unfortunate that the federal government needs to borrow some money from us over the course of the rest of the year. But it's not a problem. It won't really impact anything else that we need to do.\nJulio Romero: Got it. That makes sense. And then conversely, I guess, could that change in deductibility to the R&D expenditures, maybe create some M&A opportunities from smaller companies who may not be as able to handle that change to their balance sheets?\nBill George: Maybe when some of them realize it. I think it's going to be devastating for companies, certain companies on the West Coast, certain places where research is really what they do as a company. I don't know how they'll be able to cope with this. But in our industry, I don't think it will have that big of an effect on the smaller companies. Most of them are unaware of it. And we might clear up by the time they figure it out. But it's black letter law. If you're a big company like ours, you have to just follow the law.\nJulio Romero: Got it. I'll pass it on. Thanks so much.\nBrian Lane: Thanks Julio.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Please standby for our next caller [Operator Instructions]\nBill George: Hello, Rica.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nSean Eastman: Hi team. Great start to the year. Thanks for taking my questions.\nBrian Lane: Thanks, Sean.\nSean Eastman: So, I mean, clearly a message that the demand environment remains strong and the strength is broad based. And we're still seeing it in the bookings. But we also have this kind of unique dynamic where customers have changed their behavior. They are kind of booking you guys up early. There is more duration in the backlog. So, how would you kind of set expectations around the trajectory of the backlog around those kind of two dynamics?\nBill George: So, if I being honest, I was surprised our backlog went up further this quarter. I think some of our, we're now booked into 2025 then a lot of places. It is possible that this is a new trend in our industry, just based on the extraordinary really scarcity of productive capacity. But I suspect that for healthy reasons, our backlog at some point will come down at later, probably late this year. There are two things that will trigger that. One is, less advanced commitment. And certainly the advanced commitments that were made to induce us to enter into some leases will roll out of our backlog and the commitments that are being made by that customer will go back to a normal basis. But also I think most likely, you'll see backlog decline both when inflation moderates. And as lead times get shorter. Having said that, the demand is real -- the underlying demand is really, really strong. It's just the backlog is lumpy. And this is probably a very lumpy moment for us.\nBrian Lane: Sean, if you look at the bigger picture as well, backlog and demand strong, and we're just seeing the beginning of all the money the government pass in terms of these various acts sort of coming out of engineering and state going. So, we're early days of that as well. So I think the demand environment is going to be strong for a while.\nBill George: For years I've said that if you are following our stock, it's very important to listen to what we say about backlog, right, because we're very transparent about sort of factors that are outside of demand that are affecting our backlog, and will be that for the rest of this year, right? We'll be very clear about if we see backlog start to come down, I think we'll be very clear about whether that's demand based or whether that's just a normalization. But as of right now there is no sign of demand weakness. \nSean Eastman: Yes. Okay. Very helpful. And then just for clarity, Bill, you highlighted the modular margins are dilutive at the gross margin level. But I would imagine when you look -- when you drop that down to operating margin, they are accretive, is that right?\nBill George: Well, so they're absolutely a creative to cash flow and earnings, so we wouldn't be doing it. We don't take risk if we can, and we'd rather be smaller than take work for which we're not paid for the risk, because there's a lot of risk in what we do. There's probably lower overhead in that business. But yes, and keep in mind that that business can be done with less skilled labor. So one of the reasons that it's, if you need a lot of licensed electricians on something, you're going to pay a higher margin for that than if you need skilled plant workers even though they are really, really at a premium. They're not nearly as same premium as a pipe fitter that's licensed in a state and is the only person who can touch certified.\nSean Eastman: So you're trying to say low, perhaps lower operating margin, but higher return? Or --\nBill George: No, not at all, I would say higher scalability, and higher ability to expand. Because you can hire somebody to work in a plant and they can be making your money within a week. There's a couple of days of safety training and other stuff, then they will start doing one task. They will then train on the tasks that are left in there, right. When you hire a construction worker, you might lose money on that worker for years as you train them and bring them up to speed and then they're incredibly valuable forever. So it's just a different -- it\u2019s a different -- we are willing to take with you want to demand our most scarce resources, we charge you more for it than if you want to, if your demand is for less scarce resources.\nSean Eastman: Yes, that's helpful. And how is the service business continuing to grow so fast? We kind of get into the drivers in a lot of detail on the new construction side, but maybe a refresh on the revenue build there would be interesting?\nBrian Lane: Yes. Thanks Sean for pointing it out. We've been talking about 10 years ago, we made a organizational wide commitment to grow our service business, and all aspects that made significant commitment to training, sales side, leadership side and the tech side, we've been able to use a number of innovative tools that Trent McKenna heads up for us that we're bringing over into the service tech. So, we are still very active in hiring salespeople, hiring technicians, expanding our base, both from some of the companies we bought, but most of it same-stores. So that commitment is still 100%. And we will still fully embrace growth, because the profitability has been terrific for us in the service business. And I expect that to continue for many, many more years, Sean.\nSean Eastman: And so, is that a market share story, just to be clear, is that a market share story there? Or is it there's some, kind of juicy market growth story happening under the hood there?\nBrian Lane: Yes. I think some of its market share, I just think there's a lot more opportunity, right? We have a lot of very skilled technicians. You might look at energy efficiency in a building or just upgrading the system. So I think it's a combination of both. I think we're able to expand our services, higher capability of check now we have within the organization, all our companies are doing service. So one thing is probably 10 things.\nSean Eastman: Great. I'll turn it over there. Thanks for the insights, guys.\nBrian Lane: Yes. Thanks, Sean.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, good morning, guys. Great quarter.\nBill George: Thanks Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey, on the tax. So if Congress doesn't fix that, Bill, one question I've had is if there's a free cash flow impact next year?\nBill George: Yes. So interestingly enough, that what they're doing is they're saying this expense of your business has to be -- you have to take the deduction for the expense over five years. And so next year, there would be a smaller headwind, because we would be in year and year twos, 60% of it would be deferred rather than 80% this year, the following year, there would be a smaller headwind, then you would normalize in the fifth year, so this would be a this is a headwind for five years, if they don't, for everybody that takes the credit or that actually does, frankly, taking the credits, zero irrelevant whether you owe this money. But -- and it's a much broader definition of expenses than you find in the R&D tax credit. But yes, it's a thinking thing over five years, but Sean, I mean Adam I think it'll put people at many people especially sort of research based businesses, auto business if they don't fix it at some point. They have to at least moderate it, but we'll see.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay, helpful. And then, on modular, how are the capacity additions coming? Are you still thinking that comes online this summer? And then what would you do if you had another order similar to the one that you had in December?\nBill George: Well. So we get to decide whether we can take orders, right? But keep in mind that the one in December was for a couple of years. And they also made some other commitments over a longer period to permit us to make those really to permit it really, it was to permit us to make those investments without raising our prices. And so, with these additions, we have capacity to take some more work. Some of the space we're adding is also taller, which gives you an opportunity to work at two levels. But if we -- at some point, if we get an opportunity to expand further, we'll take a look at the risk and reward of that opportunity. And how are those expansion then we'll make a decision at that point. Right now, we're working on what's right in front of us.\nBrian Lane: We are on schedule in terms of getting him up and running.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then just lastly, maybe you can opine on the M&A outlook?\nBill George: So, we advanced a certain amount of M&A in '21, with a concern people had about an increase in capital gains, right. So we are in a very patient mindset. And we are only buying companies where we have very high conviction or had a very long gestation. I think that would certainly continue this year. I was surprised we did Eldeco this year. But this is a company we've talked to since 2016. We had a great deal of admiration for that company. When they were ready to sell we were ready to buy. I would say the middle of it is we're coming up on the middle of the year I don't know if most if there could be zero or one more deal this year. But we're not. Right now we're in a -- we're also watching the market change. The cost of capital is changing. The people who compete with us for those companies are facing very, very different circumstances than they have in the past. We've always been patient about these things. And I would say we definitely have a patient, high conviction mindset. But we're doing development all the time. In fact, I probably will do more development visits this year than I've done on track to do far more than I've done in the last three years keeping in mind COVID. So we're really trying to make sure we're working hard on development to the future.\nAdam Thalhimer: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, thanks. Good morning.\nBill George: Hey, Good morning, Brent.\nBrent Thielman: Hey, Brian. Hey, Bill, just on that R&D tax issue, you made a comment, could put a lot of people out of business. Are you referring to folks within your own industry?\nBill George: No, I'm really referring to technological companies, pharmaceutical company like startup pharmaceuticals, or they'll have to go sell very quickly to somebody. I mean, what you do as a primary part of your business is research, and you are only allowed to treat 20% of every dollar you spend on research as a expense for that year, you can take a company that's losing money in the real world and tax it as if it's got 70% margins. Many of those companies do not have the balance sheets to stand up to that. So, I think that's the kind of thing I'm talking about.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. And in the context of your own sort of capital deployment, I guess strategy over the next coming quarters is that top of mind for you before you decide to look at buybacks and deals and things like that?\nBill George: If we're being honest, our cash flow has trended better than we would have expected a year ago or two years ago by more than this headwind. So it doesn't feel like a terrible constraint. It feels like, I think we have cash that our guys are really executing people value plumbers and pipefitters. So, I don't see how this is a big issue other than we'll pay interest. We have less cash flow, we'll either earn less interest or pay less interest, depending on whether we're cash positive or in debt a little bit.\nBrent Thielman: Right. Okay. Okay. And then, the hyperscale data center activities been a huge driver modular business, I guess, for the company overall. It still kind of have some varying views out there about future prospects. Could you talk about the levels of inquiries, maybe reviews that you guys are seeing? And how does that market compared to the last couple of years? What's been pretty robust activity you've already seen?\nBrian Lane: I'll go first. Yes, the activity is very, it's still very strong, both in modular and traditional construction. Quite frankly, we're not concerned about the datacenter market. We got plenty of work.\nBill George: I would say some of the hyperscale guys, they're all, the level of inquiry is as high or higher than it's ever been. They are more, they're putting cost into the conversation earlier and more prominently than they have in the past. The thing about us is that we really, when we do this kind of work for people, we partner with people. We work hard with them to get them a really, really good value. And they typically understand that we take a ton of risk and have to make investments to really give them the quality they expect. So I'm optimistic that the demand is high. And I'm optimistic that actually we're the best way to meet that demand right now for them.\nBrent Thielman: And then, on the modular side, at least, I think it's been mostly focused in that specific market with one sort of single large customer, correct me if I'm wrong. Is that expanding to new potential customers now in that market?\nBill George: So, it would be premature to say it's expanding. Well, so first of all, that one big order was from one customer. They were keen to make sure they got some things they needed, frankly, for their business, as far as we can tell. We did get a trial order from somebody else like them. And we'll see how that goes. But there is definitely interest. Really, the reality is, these guys who need to build hyperscale data centers, they're like us, we need to hire people. When people say, oh, what are you doing to hire people, we say everything that can be done is what we're doing to hire people. I think these hyperscale data center guys, when you ask them, what are they doing to build hyperscale data centers, I think every path towards getting these things into high quality production is what they're taking. And so, the overwhelming majority of the data centers are not built modular, right, where the math couldn't possibly support that. But we think there's a nice opportunity here for us to grow and provide for our customers that are a really good, more scalable than most path to getting what they need.\nBrent Thielman: Got it. And I guess just lastly, I think you've said past few quarters sort of ambitions and getting the electrical margins to match the mechanical margins over time presumably with the work you're seeing in bound. I guess any views on that turns into bid margins things attached with a new project that gives us more confidence around that?\nBrian Lane: Yes. Brent, for sure we've had a really as steady state increase in the margins in the electrical business over the last few years. I think that's going to continue. There is plenty of electrical out there work that we're good at, that we like to do. And the work coming forward is sufficiently challenging for us that we can raise our prices a little bit. So I'm really optimistic that we will see continued margin strength in the electrical business.\nBrent Thielman: Okay, all right. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.\nBrian Lane: All right, thanks.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for your continued interest in Comfort Systems. And once again, thank you to all our diligent employees for just doing a really an outstanding job. I mean, these results just show what happen when commitment is being made. We are looking forward to the summer [ph] and we are very optimistic for the remainder of 2023. Hope everyone has a great day and we hope to see you on the road soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Lane",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We have had a great beginning to 2023 with increased revenue and pre-tax earnings, unusually strong cash flow, and another increase in backlog. Our teams delivered amazing execution and we are very grateful for their hard work. Excluding the private tax gain that Bill will discuss in a few minutes, we are in $1.51 per share and that included $0.15 related to the favorable resolution of certain claims related disputes. Current year revenue was $1.2 billion and unprecedented same-store revenue growth of 30%. Our backlog is now over $4.4 billion, which is a same-store increase of $1.6 billion or 58% from a year ago. Our backlog growth is tangible evidence of the ongoing demand and traditional and modular construction. Cash flow this quarter was exceptional. This morning, we also increased our dividend by $0.025 per share to $0.20 per share. This increase reflects our continuing strong cash flow and our commitment to reward our shareholders. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes. But first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? Okay. Thank you, Bill. I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our backlog and markets. And I will also comment on our outlook for the rest of 2023. Our backlog at the end of the first quarter was a record $4.4 billion. Since last year this time, our same-store a backlog has increased by $1.6 billion or 58% with increases in our traditional mechanical and electrical business and substantial new bookings and our off site construction operations, where we are continuing to invest in new capacity. During the first three months of 2023, our same-store backlog increased $300 million despite heavy backlog burn in the first quarter. With a number of advanced bookings, our backlog will burn over a longer period and include audits that will be produced in 2024. Industrial customers were 51% of total revenue in the first quarter.

I'll go first. And then Bill can follow up. But anyway, good morning, Julio. And its broad based increase in backlog quite frankly, coast-to-coast, obviously we had strong performance out of technology. But we're getting it in multi sectors. It just not one or one part of the country. So it's still very active out there. And we don't see it stopping in the short-term for sure. Thanks Julio. Thanks, Sean.

You might look at energy efficiency in a building or just upgrading the system. So I think it's a combination of both. I think we're able to expand our services, higher capability of check now we have within the organization, all our companies are doing service. So one thing is probably 10 things. Yes. Thanks, Sean. We are on schedule in terms of getting him up and running. I'll go first. Yes, the activity is very, it's still very strong, both in modular and traditional construction. Quite frankly, we're not concerned about the datacenter market. We got plenty of work. Yes. Brent, for sure we've had a really as steady state increase in the margins in the electrical business over the last few years. I think that's going to continue. There is plenty of electrical out there work that we're good at, that we like to do. And the work coming forward is sufficiently challenging for us that we can raise our prices a little bit. So I'm really optimistic that we will see continued margin strength in the electrical business. All right, thanks. Okay. Thank you, everyone, for your continued interest in Comfort Systems. And once again, thank you to all our diligent employees for just doing a really an outstanding job. I mean, these results just show what happen when commitment is being made. We are looking forward to the summer [ph] and we are very optimistic for the remainder of 2023. Hope everyone has a great day and we hope to see you on the road soon. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks Brian. So revenue for the first quarter of 2023 was $1.2 billion, an increase of $289 million or 33% compared to last year. Our mechanical services segment revenue increased $236 million or 35% and our electrical services segment increased by 26% to $200 -- or 236 million. Thanks to our revenue increased by 30% or $265 million with remaining $24 million increase resulting from acquisitions. Our revenue growth resulted from increased activity combined with the past-through effects of inflation including higher costs for equipment and materials. The same-store percentage increase is influenced by the fact that first quarter revenue last year was lower than the rest of the year. And we will compound much higher prior year revenue comparables over the next few quarters. So our percentage growth is unlikely to remain at these levels. Revenue trends have a lot of moving pieces. But overall, we now expect full year same-store revenue growth percentage for 2023 to finish the year in the mid teens. Gross profit was $205 million for the first quarter, a $52 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage was 17.5% this quarter compared to 17.3% for the year first quarter in 2022, including the benefit from strong wins on claims that Brian mentioned. Quarterly gross profit percentage and our mechanical segment declined from 18.6% in 2022 to 17.9% in 2023. That revenue -- that decline is largely driven by the relative growth in modular construction as a portion of our revenue. Modular construction has lower gross profit margins than build construction, and then our service businesses. Margins in the electrical segment rose to 16.1% this year from 13.0% in 2022. It is currently challenging to predict how our margins will unfold for the remainder of 2023. Important factors that will influence our margins include increases in materials intensive modular and new construction, ongoing cost inflation, and the fact that with the surge in bookings, we continue to be early in many projects. Modular is also growing as a proportion of our revenue, and we are managing ramp up considerations as we bring that new modular capacity online. Despite these structural trends that might put some pressure on margins we expect good continued profitability and we are optimistic that overall our margins in 2023 will be at or near the strong levels that we achieved in 2022 on higher revenue. SG&A expense for the quarter was $135 million or 11.5% of revenue compared to $118 million or 13.3% of revenue for the first quarter in 2022. On the same-store basis, SG&A was approximately $1.4 million due to inflation, and ongoing investments to support our much higher activity levels. Our operating income roughly doubled, increasing by 99% in the first quarter of 2023 to $71 million compared to the quarter last year. We still expect interest expense in 2023 to increase from 2022. However this quarter, the higher interest expense was partially and temporarily offset by an increase in interest income related to a favorable legal outcome. Our tax rate for the quarter was 13.1%. This included an incremental benefit of $5 million or $0.12 from a conforming adjustment for the R&D tax credit of which $0.08 related to 2022. If Congress restores immediate deductibility of research expenditures and rescind this conforming adjustment, we will have to reverse that $0.12 income statement gain in the period that this occurs. Although many individual items have affected our tax rate lately, we continue to estimate that a normalized tax rate is approximately 21% to 23%. After considering all the factors above, net income for the first quarter of 2023 was $57 million or $1.59 per share. When comparing EPS to last year, it is important to recall that in the first quarter of last year, we booked a massive incremental $1.49 per share tax gain that was related to prior years. With those gains removed from both years, our first quarter 2023 earnings per share was $1.51 as compared to $0.91 in the prior year. And on that basis, our quarterly EPS increased 66% with about a fourth of that increase coming from our positive claim outcomes. Another way of looking at the year-over-year profitability comparison without tax complications is to simply compare our EBITDA, which increased 49% from last year to $90 million. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2023 was $111 million. The main driver of this outperformance was advanced billings and deferred revenue as we benefited from favorable upfront payment terms upon receipt of large orders. The benefit from these advanced payments will reverse as project costs are incurred, except to the extent that additional advanced payments are received. So please note the following. We're facing a large cash flow headwind in the coming quarters as a result of Congress's ongoing failure to extend the current deductibility of research expenditures. Unless current expensing is restored, we will make additional tax payments during the last nine months of 2023 of approximately $120 million to $140 million, because the deductibility of a large portion of our business costs will be spread over the next five years. Also capital expenditures will be higher than usual this year as we add over 1 million square feet to our modular capacity and as we purchase vehicles at a higher than usual rate, resulting from deferrals and vehicle availability during COVID. This quarter we had $ 17 million of capital expenditures, which is an 80% increase compared to the prior year. Overall, we estimate that our CapEx spend in 2023 will be roughly $60 million to $70 million. Our debt was lower at quarter as our substantial free cash flow allowed us to reduce debt by $47 million and even fund the purchase of Eldeco from cash received during the quarter. We also continued to purchase our shares, acquiring 29,000 shares at an average price of $121.36 in the first quarter and adding to the over 10 million shares we have repurchased since 2007 at an average price of $24.80. As Brian noted, we implemented another meaningful dividend increase this quarter as well. That's all I have got with financials, Brian. Yes, Julio, we got a nice order from a new customer in modular this quarter. But the majority of our backlog increase within the sequential backlog increase was broad-based. And it really just where you'd want it to be in a lot of our most successful companies. That's one of the great things about having a fantastically strong balance sheet. We float $111 million of cash this quarter. So, it's very unfortunate that the federal government needs to borrow some money from us over the course of the rest of the year. But it's not a problem. It won't really impact anything else that we need to do. Maybe when some of them realize it. I think it's going to be devastating for companies, certain companies on the West Coast, certain places where research is really what they do as a company. I don't know how they'll be able to cope with this. But in our industry, I don't think it will have that big of an effect on the smaller companies. Most of them are unaware of it. And we might clear up by the time they figure it out. But it's black letter law. If you're a big company like ours, you have to just follow the law. Hello, Rica. So, if I being honest, I was surprised our backlog went up further this quarter. I think some of our, we're now booked into 2025 then a lot of places. It is possible that this is a new trend in our industry, just based on the extraordinary really scarcity of productive capacity. But I suspect that for healthy reasons, our backlog at some point will come down at later, probably late this year. There are two things that will trigger that. One is, less advanced commitment. And certainly the advanced commitments that were made to induce us to enter into some leases will roll out of our backlog and the commitments that are being made by that customer will go back to a normal basis. But also I think most likely, you'll see backlog decline both when inflation moderates. And as lead times get shorter. Having said that, the demand is real -- the underlying demand is really, really strong. It's just the backlog is lumpy. And this is probably a very lumpy moment for us. For years I've said that if you are following our stock, it's very important to listen to what we say about backlog, right, because we're very transparent about sort of factors that are outside of demand that are affecting our backlog, and will be that for the rest of this year, right? We'll be very clear about if we see backlog start to come down, I think we'll be very clear about whether that's demand based or whether that's just a normalization. But as of right now there is no sign of demand weakness. Well, so they're absolutely a creative to cash flow and earnings, so we wouldn't be doing it. We don't take risk if we can, and we'd rather be smaller than take work for which we're not paid for the risk, because there's a lot of risk in what we do. There's probably lower overhead in that business. But yes, and keep in mind that that business can be done with less skilled labor. So one of the reasons that it's, if you need a lot of licensed electricians on something, you're going to pay a higher margin for that than if you need skilled plant workers even though they are really, really at a premium. They're not nearly as same premium as a pipe fitter that's licensed in a state and is the only person who can touch certified. No, not at all, I would say higher scalability, and higher ability to expand. Because you can hire somebody to work in a plant and they can be making your money within a week. There's a couple of days of safety training and other stuff, then they will start doing one task. They will then train on the tasks that are left in there, right. When you hire a construction worker, you might lose money on that worker for years as you train them and bring them up to speed and then they're incredibly valuable forever. So it's just a different -- it's a different -- we are willing to take with you want to demand our most scarce resources, we charge you more for it than if you want to, if your demand is for less scarce resources. Thanks Adam. Yes. So interestingly enough, that what they're doing is they're saying this expense of your business has to be -- you have to take the deduction for the expense over five years. And so next year, there would be a smaller headwind, because we would be in year and year twos, 60% of it would be deferred rather than 80% this year, the following year, there would be a smaller headwind, then you would normalize in the fifth year, so this would be a this is a headwind for five years, if they don't, for everybody that takes the credit or that actually does, frankly, taking the credits, zero irrelevant whether you owe this money. But -- and it's a much broader definition of expenses than you find in the R&D tax credit. But yes, it's a thinking thing over five years, but Sean, I mean Adam I think it'll put people at many people especially sort of research based businesses, auto business if they don't fix it at some point. They have to at least moderate it, but we'll see. Well. So we get to decide whether we can take orders, right? But keep in mind that the one in December was for a couple of years. And they also made some other commitments over a longer period to permit us to make those really to permit it really, it was to permit us to make those investments without raising our prices. And so, with these additions, we have capacity to take some more work. Some of the space we're adding is also taller, which gives you an opportunity to work at two levels. But if we -- at some point, if we get an opportunity to expand further, we'll take a look at the risk and reward of that opportunity. And how are those expansion then we'll make a decision at that point. Right now, we're working on what's right in front of us. So, we advanced a certain amount of M&A in '21, with a concern people had about an increase in capital gains, right. So we are in a very patient mindset. And we are only buying companies where we have very high conviction or had a very long gestation. I think that would certainly continue this year. I was surprised we did Eldeco this year. But this is a company we've talked to since 2016. We had a great deal of admiration for that company. When they were ready to sell we were ready to buy. I would say the middle of it is we're coming up on the middle of the year I don't know if most if there could be zero or one more deal this year. But we're not. Right now we're in a -- we're also watching the market change. The cost of capital is changing. The people who compete with us for those companies are facing very, very different circumstances than they have in the past. We've always been patient about these things. And I would say we definitely have a patient, high conviction mindset. But we're doing development all the time. In fact, I probably will do more development visits this year than I've done on track to do far more than I've done in the last three years keeping in mind COVID. So we're really trying to make sure we're working hard on development to the future. Hey, Good morning, Brent. No, I'm really referring to technological companies, pharmaceutical company like startup pharmaceuticals, or they'll have to go sell very quickly to somebody. I mean, what you do as a primary part of your business is research, and you are only allowed to treat 20% of every dollar you spend on research as a expense for that year, you can take a company that's losing money in the real world and tax it as if it's got 70% margins. Many of those companies do not have the balance sheets to stand up to that. So, I think that's the kind of thing I'm talking about. If we're being honest, our cash flow has trended better than we would have expected a year ago or two years ago by more than this headwind. So it doesn't feel like a terrible constraint. It feels like, I think we have cash that our guys are really executing people value plumbers and pipefitters. So, I don't see how this is a big issue other than we'll pay interest. We have less cash flow, we'll either earn less interest or pay less interest, depending on whether we're cash positive or in debt a little bit. I would say some of the hyperscale guys, they're all, the level of inquiry is as high or higher than it's ever been. They are more, they're putting cost into the conversation earlier and more prominently than they have in the past. The thing about us is that we really, when we do this kind of work for people, we partner with people. We work hard with them to get them a really, really good value. And they typically understand that we take a ton of risk and have to make investments to really give them the quality they expect. So I'm optimistic that the demand is high. And I'm optimistic that actually we're the best way to meet that demand right now for them. So, it would be premature to say it's expanding. Well, so first of all, that one big order was from one customer. They were keen to make sure they got some things they needed, frankly, for their business, as far as we can tell. We did get a trial order from somebody else like them. And we'll see how that goes. But there is definitely interest. Really, the reality is, these guys who need to build hyperscale data centers, they're like us, we need to hire people. When people say, oh, what are you doing to hire people, we say everything that can be done is what we're doing to hire people. I think these hyperscale data center guys, when you ask them, what are they doing to build hyperscale data centers, I think every path towards getting these things into high quality production is what they're taking. And so, the overwhelming majority of the data centers are not built modular, right, where the math couldn't possibly support that. But we think there's a nice opportunity here for us to grow and provide for our customers that are a really good, more scalable than most path to getting what they need."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Michelle. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's third quarter 2024 earnings call. Our comments today as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws and regulations. What we will say today is based upon the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual or future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation is provided as a companion to our remarks and is posted on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we are reporting record earnings and extraordinary cash flow as our teams continued great execution for our customers. We earned $4.09 per share this quarter, up 40% from last year. Our Electrical segment achieved unprecedented margins and Mechanical margins continued to be strong. Operating income is 50% higher than even our strong third quarter last year. Backlog continues far above last year as bookings were strong even though we burned through work at a record pace. Same-store quarterly revenue was higher by 18% and revenue was up 23% year-to-date. Entering the fourth quarter, same-store backlog is 21% higher than it was at this time last year and we are experiencing exceptional strength in our pipelines. We are in a fortunate position of being able to choose the work we take. Given these strong conditions and the confidence we have in our unmatched workforce, we expect continued strong results in the fourth quarter and in 2025. Cash flow surpassed any previous quarter and that extraordinary cash flow is both a great base for continued investment and a clear indicator of strong underlying trends in our execution, customer relationships and prospects. We also increased our quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $0.35 per share. This increase reflects our continuing strong cash-flow and our commitment to reward our shareholders. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes, but first I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George: Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results are remarkable with quarterly EPS exceeding $4 per share for the first time ever. Margins continue to improve and we had further SG&A leverage and we enjoyed over $300 million in operating cash flow. This quarter, we also achieved $238 million in quarterly EBITDA, a 53% increase over this quarter last year. Our newest companies continue to exceed expectations. Third-quarter revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of $434 million or 32% compared to last year. Our Mechanical segment revenue increased by 39%, benefiting from recent acquisitions, modular expansion and substantial organic construction and service growth. Electrical segment revenue increased by 8% and overall same-store revenue increased by 18% or $241 million with the remaining $193 million increase resulting from acquisitions. Through nine months, our same-store revenue has grown by 23% from the same-period last year. We are facing tougher revenue comparables in the next few quarters and currently we estimate that our fourth quarter of 2024 revenue increase will be comparable to this quarter. We also expect revenue will continue to rise in 2025, most likely by high single or low double-digit percentage growth. Gross profit was $382 million for the third quarter of 2024, a $104 million improvement compared to a year-ago. Our gross profit percentage grew to 21.1% this quarter compared to 20.1% for the third quarter of 2023. Quarterly gross profit percentage in our Electrical segment increased to 23.9% this year compared to 19.4% last year and margins in our Mechanical segment were roughly flat at 20.3%. EBITDA increased by over 50% to $238 million this quarter from a strong $156 million in the third quarter of 2023. Same-store EBITDA increased by over 30%. And even without recent acquisitions, our EBITDA exceeded $200 million. EBITDA margin for the first-nine months is 12.2%, a result of excellent execution by our workforce and strong demand in the markets we serve. Trailing 12-month EBITDA exceeds $770 million. Margins are at all-time high levels and given ongoing strong demand, we expect that our EBITDA margins for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 will continue in the strong ranges we have achieved over the last several quarters. SG&A expense for the quarter was $180 million or 9.9% of revenue compared to $143 million or 10.4% of revenue in the third quarter of 2023. The investments that we have made, including investments through SG&A, are paying off. Our operating income increased from $135 million in the third quarter of 2023 to $203 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 50%. With improved gross profit margins and favorable SG&A leverage, our operating income percentage increased to 11.2% this quarter from 9.8% in the prior year. Through nine months, we achieved a noteworthy operating income percentage of 10.1%. Our year-to-date tax-rate was 21.6%. We estimate that the full-year 2024 tax-rate will be in the 21% to 22% range. After considering all these factors, net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $146 million or $4.09 per share and that's a 39% improvement from last year. Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2024 was $572 million. We continue to benefit from advanced payments as operating cash-flow continues to exceed our earnings by about $340 million on a trailing 12-month basis, so we are well ahead of earnings and collecting our cash. We increased the pace of our share repurchases in the third quarter and have now returned $42 million to shareholders in 2024 by retiring over 130,000 shares. As we began the year, our cash balances exceeded our total debt by $161 million. With our remarkable cash flow and even after our share repurchases and funding hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase two great new companies, our cash now exceeds debt by $347 million. That's what I've got, Brian.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks a lot, Bill. I am going to discuss our business and outlook. Backlog at the end-of-the third quarter was $5.7 billion, a large year-over-year increase and a modest sequential decline. Since last year, our backlog has increased by $1.4 billion or 32%. On a same-store basis, our backlog is now $900 million higher than it was this time last year. We are entering the fourth quarter of 2024 with 21% more same-store backlog despite our strong revenue growth. Our revenue mix continues to trend towards data centers, kit fabrication, battery plants, life science and food. Industrial customers accounted for 60% of total revenue in the nine months of 2024 and they are major drivers of pipeline and backlog. Technology, which is included in industrial, was 32% of our revenue, a substantial increase from 21% in the prior year. Institutional markets, which include education, healthcare and government are also strong and represent 23% of our revenue. The commercial sector is active, but it is smaller -- but it is a smaller part of our business at about 17% of revenue. Most of our service revenue is for commercial customers, so the share of our construction revenue that is commercial is now relatively small. Construction accounted for 84% of our revenue with projects for new buildings representing 57% and existing building construction 27%. Project pipelines remain at unprecedented high levels. We include modular and new building construction and year-to-date modular was 17% of our revenue. Service revenue was up 7% this quarter and was 16% of total revenue. Service is a reliable source of profit and cash-flow and is on-track to exceed $1 billion in revenue for 2024. As noted earlier, we are entering the fourth quarter with a backlog that is 21% higher on a same-store basis than at this time last year and we have a superb team working hard for our customers every single day. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of our employees across the country, we are positive about our ongoing projects. I want to close by thanking our over 18,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Michelle for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hi, good morning, guys. Congrats on another strong quarter.\nBrian Lane: All right, Adam, thanks. Good morning.\nAdam Thalhimer: So you guys typically burn backlog in the summer, build it in the winter. I'm curious if you think we could hit a new record backlog over the next couple of quarters?\nBill George: I'd be surprised if one of the next two quarters that doesn't happen. There's really the demand -- we could book so much work if we could -- if we were willing to and could take it. So the challenge for us right now is having really disciplined project selection.\nBrian Lane: Yes, Adam, the follow up on that, it's close to coast. So we're seeing a lot of good opportunities still with no let-up in sight. So, we're pretty confident going forward into 2025.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. And then Brian, I wanted to ask you about your comment on Electrical margins, which I think you said unprecedented. I'm curious where you think those shake-out long-term? Is there like a specific project that's driving the really high margins this year or if you think that that group -- this is just what they can achieve over-time?\nBrian Lane: Well, first things, first, our electrical companies are just doing a superb job and the work they're finding, the markets are good. But as always, it comes down to execution usually and we're just executing at a really high-level. We are really fortunate to have the companies we have and the markets they are in. Those margins as we said are unprecedented, but I would think at least for a while, the characteristics are still good for the margins to stay strong, but they are really performing at a very-high level. It is very impressive and it's -- and it's each one of our electrical companies, Adam. Thanks for noticing.\nAdam Thalhimer: Great. Okay. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Alex Dwyer with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAlex Dwyer: Good morning, Brian, Bill, Trent and Julie. Thanks for taking my questions.\nBrian Lane: Good morning, Alex.\nAlex Dwyer: Good morning. So I guess first question on modular, I know the last expansion kind of came with more automation and higher roofs and I think this is a big focus for the team to drive efficiencies. Can you just kind of expand on what exactly you're working on in these efficiency initiatives next year for modular? Is this mainly happening in Houston or is it in Greensboro or is it kind of spread across both?\nBill George: It's 100% both in Texas and North Carolina. It's -- we're building up quite a fleet of robots. They are doing a really -- they're reconfiguring even incremental new space with bigger cranes really changing the workflows in ways that we think are advantageous that the new space allows us to change. But the new -- we have a new customer in modular that is starting to get really order quite a bit of product and that's given us an opportunity to sort of both design something and sort of design the way we manufacture it having learned a lot of lessons. And obviously, we're working with our existing customers to do the same thing. So, our goal is to just get better and better and I wouldn't bet against our guys.\nAlex Dwyer: Got it. That's very interesting. And then there's a lot of talk about liquid cooling in the industry, which I guess is going to be needed in addition to air-cooling for these new data centers coming up. I know you guys have a lot of experience installing liquid cooling systems already. But I just -- is there anything that changes going forward when we get to these new AI datacenter builds as liquid cooling is increasingly implemented in these projects? Just any thoughts there would be helpful.\nBill George: The density of the new stuff is amazing, like just the -- like when you look at the -- like the big pipe welds in the shop, there are far more connections up-and-down the pipe because you're putting more chillers per sort of per building per square foot. And it's just -- it's density. Things are happening to be designed really with an eye towards reducing distances because the amount of copper that's going in is just so expensive that things -- in the past where you'd say, oh, it's okay for this to be 90 feet from that, now you want it to be 15 feet from that because you're going to have 10 times as much copper in between the two spots. So it's really been changing. Liquid cooling is just -- the heat transfer happening in liquid is primarily what we've always done. We've never really been a source for air-cooled, the kind of air-cooled rooftop data centers that people build because we have more of a pipe fitting expertise. But it's definitely -- I don't think any of the new data centers that are being built for the -- for any hyperscalers or anybody who's interested in AI are air-cooled. And then inside of liquid cooling, now it's just how close can you get the heat transfer to where the heat is being shut-off of the chip. And it's kind of an all-of-the-above strategy, right? Used to think it was exciting when we could bring the liquid up under the racks and then it was exciting when we brought it into the racks and now you bring it into the box. And there are -- they're designing chips for there to be contact, the cool liquid that's not direct but near direct contact. In just about every way of doing it, people are -- other than immersion, which I think is still a challenge, I think every way of doing it, people are just employing an all-of-the-above strategy. And the good news for us is, no matter how you do it, you got to get -- you got to have the cooling, right? And to do that, you have to have pipes and chillers and electrical switch gear. So I don't know, it's a great trend for us. And the demand for data center stuff, I mean, it's really becoming more than talk. Like there's data's -- data centers now in states that we never -- it never occurred to us that there would ever be data centers in, so the demand there is really extraordinary.\nAlex Dwyer: Thank you. I'll turn it over here.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrian Lane: Hi, Julio.\nJulio Romero: Thanks. Hi, good morning, everyone. Hi, good morning.\nBrian Lane: Good morning.\nJulio Romero: So, appreciate you guys providing preliminary sales thoughts for 2025 of the high-single-digit to low double-digit percentage growth. Just wanted to get your thoughts on what it would take for margins to continue to expand with the conditions that are allowing you to execute and achieve these high margins have to kind of sustain, would they have to get better? Just any thoughts there.\nBrian Lane: Well, if you look at the margins, we got -- I probably have said this every quarter for the last few, they were record levels for us. It's a combination of pricing as always and executing and we're executing really at a high-level, but it's a long process to get these margins, right. It starts with developing the workforce we have, applying technology and innovation that works for us and we got a great team that trends leading on those efforts and using things such as BIM prefabrication, et cetera. And then managing the risk we have in our projects, which we spend a lot of time training our people on. So the results is, one number we talk about here, but it's a lot of work that goes into it. And we will probably stay around this ballpark as long I think as the market stays as good and we continue to stay focused on our execution.\nJulio Romero: Okay. And you mentioned mitigating risk and project selection is a big part of that. You're in a position where you can kind of afford to be picky. Just if you could speak to what factors within projects help them rise to the top of your selection list?\nBrian Lane: Well, if you look at any contract, it's -- we have too much work is when you get in trouble, not too little. So no, we're really looking at work in locations around the offices that we have, usually for a customer who worked at for a long-time, we know them. It's work we've done for a while and we're good at. And like you stay in those key metrics is others. But if you keep yourself in that wheelhouse, you usually work-out pretty well on a long-term basis.\nBill George: Yes. I mean, I think an interesting major consideration for a lot of our business development people and really our leadership at the field-level right now is what jobs will be good for the people, right? Because does it have -- is the location good for our people? Does it have a GC that runs a good job and does it make people's lives miserable? Is there parking? Is there a place to get lunch? Are the other contractors on the job, people that we work with frequently because our -- people know them and it's a better world, better life for them to be around the people that they know. And then, of course, hugely important is are these existing customers who have been good to us in the past and who we can be good to now and we can succeed with based on a history of track-record. And then finally, what is the amount of gross profit sort of for the amount of labor that we have to commit, right? Or ultimately, we use -- people used to talk about gross profit per hour worked. Sometimes now you think more in terms of gross profit per $100 of labor, but I think that's where we look for profitability. It's not really gross profit percentage because not all jobs have the same amount of the same cost of goods sold, the same mix of material and things that go through them. And -- so I think it's people first, partner second, profit third, but they're not independent variables. They're highly dependent variables and the ones that are best for any of the three are probably best for the other two.\nBill George: And wholly on top of all this, you got to make sure we can do it safely and protect the health and welfare of our folks that are doing the job. So, we spend a lot of time focused on obviously projects, acquire them and execute them.\nJulio Romero: Understood. I appreciate the color. I'll pass it on.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: And one moment. Our next question is going to come from the line of Josh Chan with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJosh Chan: Hi, good morning, Brian, Trent, Bill, Julie. Maybe sticking with a question on the field...\nBrian Lane: Good morning.\nJosh Chan: Hi, good morning. Hi, Brian. In the last couple of years, you've done a great job kind of driving productivity gains in the field. I know that everybody has been really busy. So could you just talk to your ability to kind of further drive your field productivity and how you feel about that going-forward?\nBill George: I'll say, I think a big source of -- so we're really being held by technology. One really salient way that technology helps is, as your drawings get better, your performance gets better. Your opportunity to prefabricate things even to maybe modularize things and at various levels gets better. But frankly, really good drawings allow you to avoid rework. The other thing that I think is really gratifying and amazing at comfort is our ability to keep people in a place and at a time when they can continuously work in a productive way. So, utilization in -- is really the magic key to outcome -- to financial outcomes for us and having people on jobs where they can be productive because it's a well-run job. But also having the ability to level load the work you do. And one of the things that is really helping us with that is our company is working together. So, if a job has an air pocket or if a job -- if there's a good opportunity, we -- our company's ability to share workforce can really help us level load and utilization isn't -- and frankly, just when you're busy, your opportunity to have high levels of like utilization, effectiveness per hour worked is just -- it's really good.\nBrian Lane: You know, Josh, one thing I talked about Trent and his team a minute ago, one thing that group is really helping us with is that there's a lot of technologies rolling through construction right now. Their ability to filter them and see which ones we can apply in the field to make us more efficient, productive and safe, has been a huge help to us and they've done it -- just continue to do an outstanding job helping our folks on job sites and service calls, in particular. So I really want to tip my hat to those folks. They're doing a hell of a job for us.\nJosh Chan: Yes, thank you. That's really great color. Bill, you mentioned the balance sheet and obviously you guys have done really good with M&A over time. Could you just talk to the uses of cash from here, especially when free cash flow generation has been stronger than historical? Thank you.\nBill George: So we did -- I noted that we picked up our share repurchases in the third quarter. That's a combination of really fantastic cash flow and a lot of confidence about our prospects going forward. I think our first use of cash is always going to be great companies, but in a really disciplined way. And so far whenever we've had cash, we've been able to find great opportunities to bring additional workforce, people, businesses, customer relationships into the -- into Comfort Systems, which is a really great place to be a contractor.\nJosh Chan: Great. Thank you for the color and good luck for the rest of the year.\nBill George: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thielman: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Brian or Bill, I guess when I go through the different end-markets, the manufacturing vertical was sort of the one I guess of real size that had taken a step-back relative to last year and maybe even next to the second quarter. And what are you seeing in that area in particular? Is it your view of this is just sort of timing-related? Anything to say around the opportunity pipeline in that vertical?\nBill George: So for the -- as far as opportunity goes, the opportunity is very strong, especially in food. And frankly, pharma is very, very strong. I will say the trend you saw this year was really a movement towards -- a choice being made to move towards some data center work by a couple of our largest industrial subsidiaries because it was the best work available and that was their best opportunity to give their guys good work to work on and make the most money. So that's -- we could switch to manufacture -- our guys get to pick and choose right now. So, when you see movements between those major segments, it's a reflection of choices that are being made and customers that are sort of giving us terms that we find to be attractive.\nBrent Thielman: Okay. And I think you guys have sort of a level of visibility, especially on some of these larger kind of multi-phase projects where maybe you don't have a signed award, but you're sort of in the seat for future phases. Can you talk around that? Is that partially what's given you the confidence to say this demand environment isn't really fading? Is it something else?\nBrian Lane: Yes, Brent, absolutely right on the money. And even before that, right, in terms of us assisting general contractors and customers when they're looking at jobs in the early phase down to award and a lot of these projects get rewarded in phases now, right, maybe 5%, 10%, 20% that goes into backlog at that pace. So you're right on the money and that's why we're really upbeat about next year because we know it's in our pipeline, quote-unquote it's in our soft backlog. And we're in good shape right now.\nBill George: And we're in budget meetings right now, including this week and the percentage of our work that's negotiated is much higher right now. It's always been high and it's higher than ever. And so some of that, there's a lead-time. They release you to do a certain amount of work early-on because you're -- it's just that -- you're just one company working with another company. There aren't other factors involved. So, there's not necessarily as much of an award moment. There's just moments when the scope gets to where it needs to go and you sign a piece of paper that meets our financial accounting rules definition of backlog. But there is -- there really is plenty of work to do.\nBrent Thielman: Yes, that's helpful. I guess just on the cash-flow, I mean, obviously extraordinary here. Are the terms that you're getting, I guess, under these new contracts confined to a particular group of customers? Or are you really able to negotiate some favorable terms across-the-board? I'd just be curious around that.\nBill George: But without it -- so there is certainly, for example, we've talked about how in modular there are upfront payments sometimes for work that won't be performed right now until 2026. That's considerable. But I would say in virtually all of our businesses, we -- because -- when you have the ability to pick and choose work, you pick and choose based on pricing, based on the things I talked about relating to your people earlier, but payment terms are important, right. Every contract has a schedule of values. And sometimes there are large customers who would rather give you better payment terms if they can -- than give you even more money in profit. I don't know. And at some point, there are trade-offs there. But without a doubt, this is true -- by the way, this has been true forever in the construction industry. Whenever you have -- you're in a position to have bargaining power, your cash flows get better because you get better schedules and values, of course, right, everything's traded.\nBrent Thielman: The other thing, Bill, I know you by the way - yes, go ahead.\nBill George: The other thing I'll say is customers and this is in -- Brian has a quote in the sentence in the press release that alludes to this, customers are just more willing to pay you when they're interested in not just making sure you finish the current job, but that you take the next job from them. And you'd be surprised how much of an effect that can have.\nBrent Thielman: And Bill, I know you're adamant that this can't continue on forever, but if you looked at the contracts you're signing today, I mean, are those terms is as favorable as they were 12 months ago such that you could still continue to see this sort of free-cash conversion?\nBill George: Yes. So we're not signing any work today that's worse than the work we've signed -- we're signed last year. And as far as how long this goes, there's two answers to that question. There's the immediate what do you actually see, know about, has holes being dug in the ground, that's never been better. That's really, really good, right? We have more visibility than we've ever had. There's never been a time when in October of 2024, we would have been talking about having work in 2026. This is new for us. But also the underlying -- it is very plausible that people -- that the things that are being built like the chip fabrication factories and the data centers and the pharma, which is just starting, it is very, very plausible to me that that has many, many years to run. And some of this new business is incremental. It's not as if -- it's not as if just because we've decided in the United States even before the CHIPS Act that we needed to build a bunch of chip fabrication. It's not as if the things Comfort Systems USA was building before stopped. It's not as if people stop putting mayonnaise on their sandwiches and stopped feeding their dogs pet food and stopped needing hospitals. The baby boomers are still aging. So these are all incremental sources of demand. And after 15 years of headwind from offshoring, having the United States be such a favorable destination for capital is really helpful if you're -- if what you do for a living is deploy and form capital?\nBrent Thielman: Excellent. Sorry, just last question. Again, I know you've wanted to take some time to absorb the Summit transaction, looks like that's going really well among the others you've done, obviously can't time when deals happen, but maybe more a question just around the -- given the strength of the industry, your own business, the multiples you're seeing out there for potential transactions dramatically changed from maybe what you've talked about in the past?\nBill George: You know multiples, people talked about multiples, but a far, far more potent variable when you're thinking about what you're paying for something is what you're multiplying by. So what the reliable source of cash-flow that you're buying will be, what the earnings of what you're buying will be. I think that multiples are very, very strong when you compare them or there are people who are willing to pay a lot, a high multiple for certain things if you look at a multiyear trailing average. But I think ultimately the people who sell to us, the ones that we want to buy, they really understand the nature of our business. And so far, I think we -- so far, we've been able to get deals at what we think are the same very, very reasonable multiples of what the future of these businesses look like. That's why I think we're good at acquisitions. I think we have a really, really good insight into the businesses we're buying and what they're really worth. And so certain businesses -- it's one of the reasons we've been moving towards these industrial complex companies for a long-time. I think we just really believe that they have an embedded advantage that's very valuable right now. So I know that was not a very -- that didn't answer your question on the basis you wanted it, but it answered your question on the basis that I think is the most important way to think about it. I think pricing is very reasonable, especially when you consider a lot of people who look at pricing trends over 10 years or 12 years in our industry, they forget that corporate tax rates dropped not that long ago. And so when you buy these companies, you're getting a whole different amount of free-cash flow than you were getting. When you bought -- it used to be if I -- if we bought a company, we got to keep $0.60 of every dollar they earned today because they give us tax-deductible goodwill. Our acquired companies have a lower effective tax-rate than our existing business. We're keeping well over $0.80 of every dollar. So, if you break all of that together, I think pricing is pretty good and I think you're seeing that in sort of the value accretion that these wonderful companies have been able to accomplish for us.\nBrent Thielman: All right. I appreciate all the context. Best of luck. Thanks, guys.\nBrian Lane: See you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And we have a follow up question from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAdam Thalhimer: Thanks, guys. I was just curious on the data centers, the total addressable market for Comfort. As these guys start talking about one all the way up to 5 gigawatt data centers, as the data center gets bigger, does that increase your TAM?\nBill George: So every data center that we build today has way more content for us. The dollars for the same sort of piece of land are much, much higher. As far as the addressable market, I don't really think there is an addressable market in the sense that, oh, there's X out there to be done. I think that what is out there to be done in the area of data centers is what can be done. And what can be done will be less than they're hoping to do, but they'll size -- they're going to build as much as they can. It's a -- it's sort of think about it like chip speed. There is not an amount of compute they want and then they'd be done. There's not a size of a data lake that they want and then they'll just be happy and done. They -- there's two things they want. They want as much compute and as much data as they can get and they want to make very certain that the other people that they compete with don't have more than they do.\nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. The other question I've been getting is on - I'm still getting a question on uses of cash. If you - because you guys are at a record amount of net cash...\nBill George: So am I.\nAdam Thalhimer: Just curious if that makes buybacks more attractive?\nBill George: We are definitely prepared to buy shares on dips. We always have been and we buy -- we started for the first time ever, like this quarter, we increased our share buyback in the third quarter without a dip. Now it then went up by more, so we ended up getting a ton of shares in the low $300s and it looked like a good deal. But when we were buying them, we were buying them at all-time highs. So we have a lot of confidence that we have an ability to run a good business for some years to come.\nBrian Lane: We have the dividend a little bit this quarter to $0.05, so...\nBill George: But it's not going to use the free cash flow now.\nBrian Lane: No. But I'm just trying to help you out, Adam, where you note.\nAdam Thalhimer: I appreciate that. I think I'm all set. I'm going to get it out quickly. Have a good weekend.\nBill George: Every year we -- yes.\nBrian Lane: Take care, bro.\nAdam Thalhimer: No go ahead, Bill. I didn't want to interrupt you.\nBrian Lane: Yes, we thought you had a half foot off the door.\nBill George: So every year we know that we have cash and we have the goal to deploy it into companies that we have conviction are fantastic -- have fantastic workforces. So far, we've succeeded. I think our pipeline is very good, mainly because Comfort's reputation as a place to be is very good. So I like our chances of deploying that cash. But I will say, like some of our competitors or some of our comparables, if we don't find stuff that we have conviction around, we won't do deals. We will not be hurried. We won't do deals that we don't have belief in. So, I'm optimistic, but I will say discipline first.\nAdam Thalhimer: I look forward to seeing what you do this winter. Thanks guys.\nBill George: Yes.\nBrian Lane: All right. See you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question is a follow up question from the line of Josh Chan with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJosh Chan: Hi, guys. Just a quick clarifying question. When you guys say margins stay around current levels, it's still within the context that there is seasonality to your margins in Q3 and possibly Q2 is usually the high quarter and Q1, Q4 are lower. Is that a fair characterization at least on the EBITDA level?\nBill George: Yes. And it's especially true for Q1s. Our Q1s are notably lower than our other three quarters. The other three, it is absolutely the case. 18 out of 20 years, Q4 is going to go down from Q3. Not -- but 20 out of 20 years, Q1 margins are going to be lower because of just with the volumes, the opportunity for that utilization I was talking about. We don't -- in the summer, we have more service and service pushes up your gross profit margins as the highest gross profit margins in our business. So there's a bunch of things that keep it being less than you than -- less seasonal than it used to be, but for sure, still seasonal.\nJosh Chan: Right. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for clarifying that, Bill. Have a good weekend, guys.\nBill George: Thanks.\nBrian Lane: You too.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Brian Lane for any closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. In closing, I really want to thank all our employees again. Our folks continue to deliver for our customers with a good-quality product that we do safely and efficiently. As you can tell, we're very excited closing out the year and optimistic about 2025. Thanks, everyone, for joining our call. Hope you all have a wonderful weekend. I look forward to seeing you soon. Thank you.\nBill George: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we are reporting record earnings and extraordinary cash flow as our teams continued great execution for our customers. We earned $4.09 per share this quarter, up 40% from last year. Our Electrical segment achieved unprecedented margins and Mechanical margins continued to be strong. Operating income is 50% higher than even our strong third quarter last year. Backlog continues far above last year as bookings were strong even though we burned through work at a record pace. Same-store quarterly revenue was higher by 18% and revenue was up 23% year-to-date. Entering the fourth quarter, same-store backlog is 21% higher than it was at this time last year and we are experiencing exceptional strength in our pipelines. We are in a fortunate position of being able to choose the work we take. Given these strong conditions and the confidence we have in our unmatched workforce, we expect continued strong results in the fourth quarter and in 2025. Cash flow surpassed any previous quarter and that extraordinary cash flow is both a great base for continued investment and a clear indicator of strong underlying trends in our execution, customer relationships and prospects. We also increased our quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $0.35 per share. This increase reflects our continuing strong cash-flow and our commitment to reward our shareholders. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes, but first I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? All right. Thanks a lot, Bill. I am going to discuss our business and outlook. Backlog at the end-of-the third quarter was $5.7 billion, a large year-over-year increase and a modest sequential decline. Since last year, our backlog has increased by $1.4 billion or 32%. On a same-store basis, our backlog is now $900 million higher than it was this time last year. We are entering the fourth quarter of 2024 with 21% more same-store backlog despite our strong revenue growth. Our revenue mix continues to trend towards data centers, kit fabrication, battery plants, life science and food. Industrial customers accounted for 60% of total revenue in the nine months of 2024 and they are major drivers of pipeline and backlog. Technology, which is included in industrial, was 32% of our revenue, a substantial increase from 21% in the prior year. Institutional markets, which include education, healthcare and government are also strong and represent 23% of our revenue. The commercial sector is active, but it is smaller -- but it is a smaller part of our business at about 17% of revenue. Most of our service revenue is for commercial customers, so the share of our construction revenue that is commercial is now relatively small. Construction accounted for 84% of our revenue with projects for new buildings representing 57% and existing building construction 27%. Project pipelines remain at unprecedented high levels. We include modular and new building construction and year-to-date modular was 17% of our revenue. Service revenue was up 7% this quarter and was 16% of total revenue. Service is a reliable source of profit and cash-flow and is on-track to exceed $1 billion in revenue for 2024. As noted earlier, we are entering the fourth quarter with a backlog that is 21% higher on a same-store basis than at this time last year and we have a superb team working hard for our customers every single day. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of our employees across the country, we are positive about our ongoing projects. I want to close by thanking our over 18,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Michelle for questions. Thank you. All right, Adam, thanks. Good morning. Yes, Adam, the follow up on that, it's close to coast. So we're seeing a lot of good opportunities still with no let-up in sight. So, we're pretty confident going forward into 2025. Well, first things, first, our electrical companies are just doing a superb job and the work they're finding, the markets are good. But as always, it comes down to execution usually and we're just executing at a really high-level. We are really fortunate to have the companies we have and the markets they are in. Those margins as we said are unprecedented, but I would think at least for a while, the characteristics are still good for the margins to stay strong, but they are really performing at a very-high level. It is very impressive and it's -- and it's each one of our electrical companies, Adam. Thanks for noticing. All right. Thanks, Adam. Good morning, Alex. All right. Thanks. Hi, Julio. Good morning. Well, if you look at the margins, we got -- I probably have said this every quarter for the last few, they were record levels for us. It's a combination of pricing as always and executing and we're executing really at a high-level, but it's a long process to get these margins, right. It starts with developing the workforce we have, applying technology and innovation that works for us and we got a great team that trends leading on those efforts and using things such as BIM prefabrication, et cetera. And then managing the risk we have in our projects, which we spend a lot of time training our people on. So the results is, one number we talk about here, but it's a lot of work that goes into it.

And even before that, right, in terms of us assisting general contractors and customers when they're looking at jobs in the early phase down to award and a lot of these projects get rewarded in phases now, right, maybe 5%, 10%, 20% that goes into backlog at that pace. So you're right on the money and that's why we're really upbeat about next year because we know it's in our pipeline, quote-unquote it's in our soft backlog. And we're in good shape right now.

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results are remarkable with quarterly EPS exceeding $4 per share for the first time ever. Margins continue to improve and we had further SG&A leverage and we enjoyed over $300 million in operating cash flow. This quarter, we also achieved $238 million in quarterly EBITDA, a 53% increase over this quarter last year. Our newest companies continue to exceed expectations. Third-quarter revenue was $1.8 billion, an increase of $434 million or 32% compared to last year. Our Mechanical segment revenue increased by 39%, benefiting from recent acquisitions, modular expansion and substantial organic construction and service growth. Electrical segment revenue increased by 8% and overall same-store revenue increased by 18% or $241 million with the remaining $193 million increase resulting from acquisitions. Through nine months, our same-store revenue has grown by 23% from the same-period last year. We are facing tougher revenue comparables in the next few quarters and currently we estimate that our fourth quarter of 2024 revenue increase will be comparable to this quarter. We also expect revenue will continue to rise in 2025, most likely by high single or low double-digit percentage growth. Gross profit was $382 million for the third quarter of 2024, a $104 million improvement compared to a year-ago. Our gross profit percentage grew to 21.1% this quarter compared to 20.1% for the third quarter of 2023. Quarterly gross profit percentage in our Electrical segment increased to 23.9% this year compared to 19.4% last year and margins in our Mechanical segment were roughly flat at 20.3%. EBITDA increased by over 50% to $238 million this quarter from a strong $156 million in the third quarter of 2023. Same-store EBITDA increased by over 30%. And even without recent acquisitions, our EBITDA exceeded $200 million. EBITDA margin for the first-nine months is 12.2%, a result of excellent execution by our workforce and strong demand in the markets we serve. Trailing 12-month EBITDA exceeds $770 million. Margins are at all-time high levels and given ongoing strong demand, we expect that our EBITDA margins for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025 will continue in the strong ranges we have achieved over the last several quarters. SG&A expense for the quarter was $180 million or 9.9% of revenue compared to $143 million or 10.4% of revenue in the third quarter of 2023. The investments that we have made, including investments through SG&A, are paying off. Our operating income increased from $135 million in the third quarter of 2023 to $203 million for the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 50%. With improved gross profit margins and favorable SG&A leverage, our operating income percentage increased to 11.2% this quarter from 9.8% in the prior year. Through nine months, we achieved a noteworthy operating income percentage of 10.1%. Our year-to-date tax-rate was 21.6%. We estimate that the full-year 2024 tax-rate will be in the 21% to 22% range. After considering all these factors, net income for the third quarter of 2024 was $146 million or $4.09 per share and that's a 39% improvement from last year. Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2024 was $572 million. We continue to benefit from advanced payments as operating cash-flow continues to exceed our earnings by about $340 million on a trailing 12-month basis, so we are well ahead of earnings and collecting our cash. We increased the pace of our share repurchases in the third quarter and have now returned $42 million to shareholders in 2024 by retiring over 130,000 shares. As we began the year, our cash balances exceeded our total debt by $161 million. With our remarkable cash flow and even after our share repurchases and funding hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase two great new companies, our cash now exceeds debt by $347 million. That's what I've got, Brian. I'd be surprised if one of the next two quarters that doesn't happen. There's really the demand -- we could book so much work if we could -- if we were willing to and could take it. So the challenge for us right now is having really disciplined project selection. It's 100% both in Texas and North Carolina. It's -- we're building up quite a fleet of robots. They are doing a really -- they're reconfiguring even incremental new space with bigger cranes really changing the workflows in ways that we think are advantageous that the new space allows us to change. But the new -- we have a new customer in modular that is starting to get really order quite a bit of product and that's given us an opportunity to sort of both design something and sort of design the way we manufacture it having learned a lot of lessons. And obviously, we're working with our existing customers to do the same thing. So, our goal is to just get better and better and I wouldn't bet against our guys. The density of the new stuff is amazing, like just the -- like when you look at the -- like the big pipe welds in the shop, there are far more connections up-and-down the pipe because you're putting more chillers per sort of per building per square foot. And it's just -- it's density. Things are happening to be designed really with an eye towards reducing distances because the amount of copper that's going in is just so expensive that things -- in the past where you'd say, oh, it's okay for this to be 90 feet from that, now you want it to be 15 feet from that because you're going to have 10 times as much copper in between the two spots. So it's really been changing. Liquid cooling is just -- the heat transfer happening in liquid is primarily what we've always done. We've never really been a source for air-cooled, the kind of air-cooled rooftop data centers that people build because we have more of a pipe fitting expertise. But it's definitely -- I don't think any of the new data centers that are being built for the -- for any hyperscalers or anybody who's interested in AI are air-cooled. And then inside of liquid cooling, now it's just how close can you get the heat transfer to where the heat is being shut-off of the chip. And it's kind of an all-of-the-above strategy, right? Used to think it was exciting when we could bring the liquid up under the racks and then it was exciting when we brought it into the racks and now you bring it into the box. And there are -- they're designing chips for there to be contact, the cool liquid that's not direct but near direct contact. In just about every way of doing it, people are -- other than immersion, which I think is still a challenge, I think every way of doing it, people are just employing an all-of-the-above strategy. And the good news for us is, no matter how you do it, you got to get -- you got to have the cooling, right? And to do that, you have to have pipes and chillers and electrical switch gear. So I don't know, it's a great trend for us. And the demand for data center stuff, I mean, it's really becoming more than talk. Like there's data's -- data centers now in states that we never -- it never occurred to us that there would ever be data centers in, so the demand there is really extraordinary. Yes. I mean, I think an interesting major consideration for a lot of our business development people and really our leadership at the field-level right now is what jobs will be good for the people, right? Because does it have -- is the location good for our people? Does it have a GC that runs a good job and does it make people's lives miserable? Is there parking? Is there a place to get lunch? Are the other contractors on the job, people that we work with frequently because our -- people know them and it's a better world, better life for them to be around the people that they know. And then, of course, hugely important is are these existing customers who have been good to us in the past and who we can be good to now and we can succeed with based on a history of track-record. And then finally, what is the amount of gross profit sort of for the amount of labor that we have to commit, right? Or ultimately, we use -- people used to talk about gross profit per hour worked. Sometimes now you think more in terms of gross profit per $100 of labor, but I think that's where we look for profitability. It's not really gross profit percentage because not all jobs have the same amount of the same cost of goods sold, the same mix of material and things that go through them. And -- so I think it's people first, partner second, profit third, but they're not independent variables. They're highly dependent variables and the ones that are best for any of the three are probably best for the other two. And wholly on top of all this, you got to make sure we can do it safely and protect the health and welfare of our folks that are doing the job. So, we spend a lot of time focused on obviously projects, acquire them and execute them. I'll say, I think a big source of -- so we're really being held by technology. One really salient way that technology helps is, as your drawings get better, your performance gets better. Your opportunity to prefabricate things even to maybe modularize things and at various levels gets better. But frankly, really good drawings allow you to avoid rework. The other thing that I think is really gratifying and amazing at comfort is our ability to keep people in a place and at a time when they can continuously work in a productive way. So, utilization in -- is really the magic key to outcome -- to financial outcomes for us and having people on jobs where they can be productive because it's a well-run job. But also having the ability to level load the work you do. And one of the things that is really helping us with that is our company is working together. So, if a job has an air pocket or if a job -- if there's a good opportunity, we -- our company's ability to share workforce can really help us level load and utilization isn't -- and frankly, just when you're busy, your opportunity to have high levels of like utilization, effectiveness per hour worked is just -- it's really good. So we did -- I noted that we picked up our share repurchases in the third quarter. That's a combination of really fantastic cash flow and a lot of confidence about our prospects going forward. I think our first use of cash is always going to be great companies, but in a really disciplined way. And so far whenever we've had cash, we've been able to find great opportunities to bring additional workforce, people, businesses, customer relationships into the -- into Comfort Systems, which is a really great place to be a contractor. Great. Thank you. So for the -- as far as opportunity goes, the opportunity is very strong, especially in food. And frankly, pharma is very, very strong. I will say the trend you saw this year was really a movement towards -- a choice being made to move towards some data center work by a couple of our largest industrial subsidiaries because it was the best work available and that was their best opportunity to give their guys good work to work on and make the most money. So that's -- we could switch to manufacture -- our guys get to pick and choose right now. So, when you see movements between those major segments, it's a reflection of choices that are being made and customers that are sort of giving us terms that we find to be attractive. And we're in budget meetings right now, including this week and the percentage of our work that's negotiated is much higher right now. It's always been high and it's higher than ever. And so some of that, there's a lead-time. They release you to do a certain amount of work early-on because you're -- it's just that -- you're just one company working with another company. There aren't other factors involved. So, there's not necessarily as much of an award moment. There's just moments when the scope gets to where it needs to go and you sign a piece of paper that meets our financial accounting rules definition of backlog. But there is -- there really is plenty of work to do. But without it -- so there is certainly, for example, we've talked about how in modular there are upfront payments sometimes for work that won't be performed right now until 2026. That's considerable. But I would say in virtually all of our businesses, we -- because -- when you have the ability to pick and choose work, you pick and choose based on pricing, based on the things I talked about relating to your people earlier, but payment terms are important, right. Every contract has a schedule of values. And sometimes there are large customers who would rather give you better payment terms if they can -- than give you even more money in profit. I don't know. And at some point, there are trade-offs there. But without a doubt, this is true -- by the way, this has been true forever in the construction industry. Whenever you have -- you're in a position to have bargaining power, your cash flows get better because you get better schedules and values, of course, right, everything's traded. The other thing I'll say is customers and this is in -- Brian has a quote in the sentence in the press release that alludes to this, customers are just more willing to pay you when they're interested in not just making sure you finish the current job, but that you take the next job from them. And you'd be surprised how much of an effect that can have. Yes. So we're not signing any work today that's worse than the work we've signed -- we're signed last year. And as far as how long this goes, there's two answers to that question. There's the immediate what do you actually see, know about, has holes being dug in the ground, that's never been better. That's really, really good, right? We have more visibility than we've ever had. There's never been a time when in October of 2024, we would have been talking about having work in 2026. This is new for us. But also the underlying -- it is very plausible that people -- that the things that are being built like the chip fabrication factories and the data centers and the pharma, which is just starting, it is very, very plausible to me that that has many, many years to run. And some of this new business is incremental. It's not as if -- it's not as if just because we've decided in the United States even before the CHIPS Act that we needed to build a bunch of chip fabrication. It's not as if the things Comfort Systems USA was building before stopped. It's not as if people stop putting mayonnaise on their sandwiches and stopped feeding their dogs pet food and stopped needing hospitals. The baby boomers are still aging. So these are all incremental sources of demand. And after 15 years of headwind from offshoring, having the United States be such a favorable destination for capital is really helpful if you're -- if what you do for a living is deploy and form capital? You know multiples, people talked about multiples, but a far, far more potent variable when you're thinking about what you're paying for something is what you're multiplying by. So what the reliable source of cash-flow that you're buying will be, what the earnings of what you're buying will be. I think that multiples are very, very strong when you compare them or there are people who are willing to pay a lot, a high multiple for certain things if you look at a multiyear trailing average. But I think ultimately the people who sell to us, the ones that we want to buy, they really understand the nature of our business. And so far, I think we -- so far, we've been able to get deals at what we think are the same very, very reasonable multiples of what the future of these businesses look like. That's why I think we're good at acquisitions. I think we have a really, really good insight into the businesses we're buying and what they're really worth. And so certain businesses -- it's one of the reasons we've been moving towards these industrial complex companies for a long-time. I think we just really believe that they have an embedded advantage that's very valuable right now. So I know that was not a very -- that didn't answer your question on the basis you wanted it, but it answered your question on the basis that I think is the most important way to think about it. I think pricing is very reasonable, especially when you consider a lot of people who look at pricing trends over 10 years or 12 years in our industry, they forget that corporate tax rates dropped not that long ago. And so when you buy these companies, you're getting a whole different amount of free-cash flow than you were getting. When you bought -- it used to be if I -- if we bought a company, we got to keep $0.60 of every dollar they earned today because they give us tax-deductible goodwill. Our acquired companies have a lower effective tax-rate than our existing business. We're keeping well over $0.80 of every dollar. So, if you break all of that together, I think pricing is pretty good and I think you're seeing that in sort of the value accretion that these wonderful companies have been able to accomplish for us. So every data center that we build today has way more content for us. The dollars for the same sort of piece of land are much, much higher. As far as the addressable market, I don't really think there is an addressable market in the sense that, oh, there's X out there to be done. I think that what is out there to be done in the area of data centers is what can be done. And what can be done will be less than they're hoping to do, but they'll size -- they're going to build as much as they can. It's a -- it's sort of think about it like chip speed. There is not an amount of compute they want and then they'd be done. There's not a size of a data lake that they want and then they'll just be happy and done. They -- there's two things they want. They want as much compute and as much data as they can get and they want to make very certain that the other people that they compete with don't have more than they do. So am I. We are definitely prepared to buy shares on dips. We always have been and we buy -- we started for the first time ever, like this quarter, we increased our share buyback in the third quarter without a dip. Now it then went up by more, so we ended up getting a ton of shares in the low $300s and it looked like a good deal. But when we were buying them, we were buying them at all-time highs. So we have a lot of confidence that we have an ability to run a good business for some years to come. But it's not going to use the free cash flow now. Every year we -- yes. So every year we know that we have cash and we have the goal to deploy it into companies that we have conviction are fantastic -- have fantastic workforces. So far, we've succeeded. I think our pipeline is very good, mainly because Comfort's reputation as a place to be is very good. So I like our chances of deploying that cash. But I will say, like some of our competitors or some of our comparables, if we don't find stuff that we have conviction around, we won't do deals. We will not be hurried. We won't do deals that we don't have belief in. So, I'm optimistic, but I will say discipline first. Yes. Yes. And it's especially true for Q1s. Our Q1s are notably lower than our other three quarters. The other three, it is absolutely the case. 18 out of 20 years, Q4 is going to go down from Q3. Not -- but 20 out of 20 years, Q1 margins are going to be lower because of just with the volumes, the opportunity for that utilization I was talking about. We don't -- in the summer, we have more service and service pushes up your gross profit margins as the highest gross profit margins in our business. So there's a bunch of things that keep it being less than you than -- less seasonal than it used to be, but for sure, still seasonal. Thanks. Thanks."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead.\nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Daniel. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings call. Our comments today as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws and regulations. What we will say today is based on the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release covering these earnings. A slide presentation has provided as a companion to our remarks. This presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company\u2019s website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We had a fantastic quarter as our teams achieved superb execution for our customers. We earned $3.74 per share this quarter, which is an increase of over 90% compared to a year ago. Our Mechanical business exceeded last year and our Electrical segment achieved unprecedented margins. Both operating income and EBITDA dollars increased by 100% this quarter compared to 2023. Demand remains strong, especially in the industrial sector, including technology and other manufacturing customers. Our backlog continues to track at high levels, despite our strong revenue for the quarter. Backlog is $5.8 billion, far higher on both an absolute and a same-store basis than this time last year, and we continue to select work that has good margins and good working conditions for our valuable people. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes, but first I'll turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill?\nBill George: Thanks Brian. So second quarter results were really remarkable. We had 30% same-store revenue growth, higher margins, good SG&A leverage and over $165 million in free cash flow. We achieved more than $200 million in quarterly EBITDA for the first time and our EBITDA doubled compared to the same quarter last year. Revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $1.8 billion, and that is an increase of $514 million or 40% compared to last year. Our Mechanical segment revenue increased by 49%, benefiting from organic construction and service growth. Recent acquisitions and modular expansion, Electrical segment revenue increased by 12% and overall our same-store revenue increased by 30% or $383 million with the remaining $131 million of increased resulting from acquisitions. We are facing tougher prior year comparable results for the remainder of the year. Through 6 months, our same-store revenue growth has been 26% and currently our best estimate is that for full year 2024, our same-store revenue growth will be in the low to mid 20% range. Gross profit was $364 million for the second quarter of 2024, a noteworthy $136 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage grew to 20.1% this quarter compared to 17.6% for the second quarter of 2023. Quarterly gross profit percentage in our Electrical segment jumped to 23.6% this year as compared to 17% last year. Margins in our Mechanical segment also increased significantly to 19.2% as compared to 17.8% in the second quarter of 2023. EBITDA doubled to $223 million this quarter from a strong $112 million in the second quarter of 2023. Same-store EBITDA increased by over 80% and even without recent acquisitions, our EBITDA exceeded $200 million. Considering the strong ongoing demand, we expect that for 2024 EBITDA margins will continue in the strong ranges that we have achieved over the last several quarters. SG&A expense for the quarter was $180 million or 9.9% of revenue compared to $136 million or 10.5% of revenue in the second quarter of 2023. Our operating income increased by just over 100% from last year, from $92 million in the second quarter of 2023 to $185 million for the second quarter of 2024. With improved gross profit margins and favorable SG&A leverage, our operating income percentage surged to 10.2% this quarter from 7.1% in the prior year. This is the first time that we have achieved 10% OI margins in a quarter. Since I became CFO, Comfort Systems has not used adjusted numbers to make our results look better. However, today I do want to point out a notable factor in our results. Our recent acquisitions have exceeded our high expectations resulting in larger than usual earn out expense. Without the changes in the fair value of our earn out obligations this quarter, certain earnings would've been notably stronger. We always have purchase related adjustments in the periods following an acquisition, however, they currently are and likely will continue to be much larger over the next several quarters because of the significant contingent consideration opportunity included in recent transactions. Our year-to-date tax rate was 21.3%. We currently estimate that the full year 2024 tax rate will likely be in the 21% to 22% range. After considering all of these factors, net income for the second quarter of 2024 was $134 million or $3.74 per share, and this is a 90% improvement from last year. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2024 was $290 million. We continue to benefit from advanced payments for work that we will fund and complete in upcoming quarters, and operating cash flow continues to exceed our earnings by about $300 million on a trailing 12-month basis. So we are well ahead of earnings in collecting our cash. Even with two notable acquisitions earlier this year, we have succeeded in retiring all of our bank debt as of June 30, 2024, and other debt was $91 million with cash balances exceeding our debt. We also spent around $11 million on share repurchases this quarter. That's what I got, Brian.\nBrian Lane: Okay. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to discuss our business and outlook. Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was $5.8 billion, a large year-over-year increase and a modest sequential decline. Since last year, our backlog has increased by $1.6 billion or 38%. $1 billion of the increase was same-store and $0.6 billion was new backlog from recent acquisitions. We are entering the second half of 2024 with 25% more same-store backlog than we had at this time last year despite a roughly 30% surge in organic revenue. Our revenue mix continues to trend towards data centers, chip fab, battery plants, life science and food. Industrial customers accounted for 60% of total revenue in the first half of 2024, and they are major drivers of pipeline and backlog. Technology, which is included in industrial was 31% of our revenue, a substantial increase from 20% the prior year. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government, are also strong and represent 23% of our revenue. The commercial sector remains reasonably active in the regions that we serve, but it is now a smaller part of our business at about 17% of revenue. Most of our service revenue is for commercial customers. Of the share of our construction revenue that is commercial is not relatively small. Construction activities continue to be extraordinarily strong and our project pipelines continue at unprecedented high levels. Construction accounted for 84% of our revenue with projects for new buildings representing 59% and existing building construction 25%. We include modular in new building construction and year-to-date modular was 18% of our revenue. Service revenue was 16% of our total revenue as our service revenue increased by 10% and service profit grew by 20% this quarter. Service is a reliable source of profit and cash flow and is on track to exceed $1 billion in revenue for 2024. As noted above, we are entering the second half of 2024 with a backlog that is 25% higher on the same-store basis that we had at this time last year, and we have a superb team working hard for our customers every single day. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of our employees across the country. We are optimistic about our future. As always, I want to close by thanking our over 17,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Daniel for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Dwyer with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAlex Dwyer: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\nBrian Lane: Good morning.\nAlex Dwyer: Good morning. So it's nice to see the continued strength in margins and the guidance calls for this to continue this year. But how sustainable do you think these margins are as we think about the business on a longer term basis? Is there any reason to think these margins would ultimately revert back more towards the historical averages over time?\nBrian Lane: I think, Alex, particularly, the upcoming short-term, I think we're in pretty good shape to maintain these margins. We're getting good pricing and we're getting excellent execution in the field. And also, you can't forget, we are growing service 10% and you see profitability increase there. So I think we're pretty optimistic in the near future that we should maintain these margins.\nBill George: Yes, I would say every factor that is creating these margins is continuing at least as strong as it has been and in some cases continues to get stronger.\nAlex Dwyer: Got it. And then the modular construction performance in the quarter, was most of that project activity for data centers? And then more broadly, how do we think about the growth algorithm in modular going forward, capacity additions, and the ability for the business to gain efficiencies over time?\nBill George: So modular, like really every single part of our business, did great this quarter. And it's -- as you can see, it's growing. It's up to near 18% of our revenue and -- so its adding a percentage while the revenue is growing very quickly. So that's continued to grow. As far as the future, people have been asking a lot, are we going to make new large commitments to space. I don't think that that is something that we are taking incremental commitments. We have added incremental space within the last few months. We're more likely to do things incrementally and I do want to say that one of the things that we emphasized when we took the additional million square foot of space that we took recently, we took space that was much -- had much higher roots and was much more configured for automation. And so I think a lot of our goal is going to be to improve the production and productivity of the newly deployed space. Ultimately, comfort is going to take the amount of work we can execute. And with people -- there are businesses that you can scale easily. This is a business that you're doing things in the real world. You're delivering things that are three-storied tall and 100 yards long and have incredible complexity inside them. And you have to respect the difficulty of what you're doing and make sure we will always put our ability to keep our promises to our customers above sort of pushing for growth on the top line.\nAlex Dwyer: Thank you. I'll turn it over.\nBrian Lane: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.\nAdam Thalhimer: Hey good morning, guys. Great quarter.\nBill George: Hey, Adam.\nBrian Lane: Thanks, Adam. How are you doing?\nAdam Thalhimer: Good. All right. So also on modular, I think it was late -- was it December of 2022 you had like a program award for modular? I'm curious if you see the potential for more of those going forward or if future modular awards are more one-off?\nBill George: So I don't know about one-off, they're just constant. So in 2021 December, there was a big commitment that was part of a really more than a year's negotiation with a large customer that induced us to make a really big investment in a million square feet of additional space. Since then, we've been able to re-keep the backlog at at least the levels that we achieved sort of in that time frame. But it's the award sort of come in as programs are completed, right? There's short, there are redesigns that happen in the products that we sell. And I don't know if it will continue, but I will say in the last 3 years, we tended to get more of the modular bookings in the winter months, sort of December, January, February, and we've had sort of a net burn in the middle of the year. We certainly had a net burn in modular this quarter, but we -- it's because we had really big bookings over the winter. And I think our prospects are good for that, but obviously it depends if people are still planning on having data and computing power, right, which we think they are.\nAdam Thalhimer: All right, well, that was my next question, backlog seasonality, because for a couple years now it's been burn over the summer and build over the winter. Can that happen again?\nBrian Lane: Yes, so if you look at last year, we sort of went through the same cycle. I mean, the thing you look at, we look at, Adam, is, what's the demand, what's our pipelines look like? They're robust. It's in all the markets we served. It's probably as strong. I've been doing this for 40-some years. It's probably the best market I've ever been in. So we're pretty optimistic. There's going to be plenty of work for a while.\nAdam Thalhimer: And then lastly, can you just comment on Texas electrical? The margin's over 22% again for the third straight quarter. What's the outlook for that business?\nBrian Lane: Yes. Well, first of all, the electrical company we have here was really a -- is really a superb company that Bill found for sure. They're in the four big markets that we like in Texas. We have more electricians than anyone else, and Texas is booming. We got a lot of mission-critical work, which is really in the sweet spot. So we're really humming along in that business right now and I think it'll go on for a while.\nBill George: It's also important to know it's the electrical segment is not just Texas. We have unbelievable results right now in Kentucky and North Carolina. We have just fantastic electrical businesses. People need what they do. They do a great job for their customers, and they make sure that they get paid for the capacity that they can bring to bear in for the risks that they take. So it's really -- it's really to hit those kind of numbers, pretty much everybody had to be just having an amazing outcome. It's good to have electricians right now, Adam.\nAdam Thalhimer: Good to hear. All right. Thank you, guys.\nBrian Lane: All right. Take care.\nBill George: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Chan with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJosh Chan: Hi. Good morning, guys. Congrats on a really good quarter.\nBrian Lane: Thanks, Josh.\nJosh Chan: I guess, Brian, if you really look at the bidding pipeline, do you see kind of new projects popping up for bid at similar or stronger rates? And where are those verticals, any difference versus sort of the recent past?\nBrian Lane: I think -- if you look at the pipelines in the backlog, it's probably pretty -- been pretty consistent for the last 18 months to 2 years. We're still seeing, as we mentioned in the script, similar opportunities, data centers, pharma, life sciences, food, et cetera. So we're seeing the mix pretty consistent in the markets that we serve, and there's been no let up, Josh.\nBill George: If you don't mind, I'll just comment on data centers. People -- there are people right now who seem to be concerned that something's happening with the data center build. What we are hearing from our customers and experiencing in the market is that they are continuing to believe in deploying data centers. They've bought a lot of very, very expensive computer chips. They're taking delivery of those on a regular basis. Our understanding is they're going to be deployed into servers and put in buildings that are going to need to be cooled. They're going to need to be heated. I mean, sorry, they're going to need electricity because they'll be heated by the data -- by the servers. And also, we're seeing data center work pop up in places that hasn't started yet in states where we hadn't seen data centers before. So it's possible, I guess that that's slowing down, but I will say if that's happening, it's certainly not in anything that we can see or experience in our vision or our markets or in our conversations with our customers.\nJosh Chan: That's encouraging. And thanks for the color there. I guess in this current environment, how do you keep your employees happy? And I know no one is like relaxed working this hard, but any concerns about the sustainability of everybody working this hard for a long time?\nBrian Lane: Yes, Josh, that is a great question. Thanks for asking it. We really take great pride in protecting our folks from a health and safety perspective. Treat them fair, we treat them with respect. We have a lot of work for them to do, which is great for themselves and their families. But at the end of the day, we are extremely grateful for the hard work and commitment they're all making. But we really go out of our way. We're very field-focused in this company, which I'm really proud of, and we really do try to take care of them as best we can. So they like a lot of work. They like to work. So we're in a good time for them as well. So thanks -- but thanks for asking.\nJosh Chan: That's good. And maybe I can sneak one more in. If people were to ask you what percentage of your business do you think is exposed to AI, how would you address that? Is that the data center portion, or how would you kind of think about that?\nBrian Lane: Well, I think AI, let's say the demand for data, right, because even the AI build really only started last year, 15 months, right? There's been heavy data center construction because people were getting ready for streaming. Everybody's forgotten about that. Compute power, the AI thing is an incremental add to what was already a very, very solid pipeline. I would say that it's both AI and chips that are affected by, driven by, decisions by hyperscalers to protect their core businesses by making sure they're not left behind and to prepare for opportunities of the future by building out this capacity. I don't know if that helps, but ...\nJosh Chan: Yes. Yes. Thanks, Bill, and thanks -- thank you both for the response and the time.\nBill George: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Your line is now open.\nJulio Romero: Thanks. Hey, good morning, guys.\nBrian Lane: Good morning.\nJulio Romero: You guys talked about -- good morning. You guys talked about same-store sales growth in the low to mid 20% range for the full year. I guess that implies at least 15%-ish growth in the back half. Just any thoughts about how we should think about same-store sales growth percentages in 3Q and then in 4Q?\nBill George: So, through 11 months, it was 26%. So it would be in the low mid. Seems that it would have to -- it would come down some, but maybe not down to 15%, right, if you -- if the second half was 15%, that's going to average below 20%. So we're -- it's a little stronger than that. We don't really know what's going to happen. There's a lot --\u2013 we are -- on July 1 of this year, we had 25% more booked work on a same-store basis than we had last year. So we believe we're going to have very strong growth for the full year. Our best estimate is that low-mid 20% range. But I will say there's a range around that of what could happen, and we do -- we have seemed to be surprised to the upside lately.\nJulio Romero: Got it. That's helpful. And then you guys talked about factors that are creating these margins. One of them I would think would be project selection. Can you maybe just talk about that and how crucial a factor that is in creating these margins? And is that kind of like a rising tide of sorts where you can just continue to see greater quantity of opportunities than you're able to do? And therefore you're able to become more and more selective on these projects?\nBill George: Yes, I think we have a process like most people do, go, no-go, but we're very careful to select. We're putting our valuable resources with good customers and doing good work. So it's really important that you go through your factors and selecting what work you're going to take in a market like this when there's a lot of work out there, Julio.\nJulio Romero: Okay. Okay. And then last one for me would just be on that 10% operating margin milestone that you hit in this quarter. I think it may also be the first time, at least in quite a while, that your SG&A margin has a nine [ph] handle on it. So maybe if you could just touch on SG&A leverage and how we should be thinking about that going forward?\nBill George: That's a great question. It's going to be hard to get much more SG&A leverage just mathematically, right? But I do think this range is we should continue in because we're continuing to get the revenue growth. We did have notable dollar increases in SG&A this quarter. It does take money to do this work. So I guess I would say, I guess if that were a modeling question, I wouldn't count on a whole lot more leverage. But I don't think, I think the leverage we've gotten so far is pretty solid until revenue, trends were to change here.\nJulio Romero: Got it. I'll pass it along. Thanks very much, guys.\nBrian Lane: Thanks.\nBill George: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Brian Lane for closing remarks.\nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, everyone, for listening in today. I really want to thank our amazing employees again. We're really grateful for the work that they do. I hope everyone enjoyed this summer and the weekend, and we look forward to seeing everybody in the road soon. Thank you.\nA - Bill George: Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. We had a fantastic quarter as our teams achieved superb execution for our customers. We earned $3.74 per share this quarter, which is an increase of over 90% compared to a year ago. Our Mechanical business exceeded last year and our Electrical segment achieved unprecedented margins. Both operating income and EBITDA dollars increased by 100% this quarter compared to 2023. Demand remains strong, especially in the industrial sector, including technology and other manufacturing customers. Our backlog continues to track at high levels, despite our strong revenue for the quarter. Backlog is $5.8 billion, far higher on both an absolute and a same-store basis than this time last year, and we continue to select work that has good margins and good working conditions for our valuable people. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes, but first I'll turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? Okay. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to discuss our business and outlook. Our backlog at the end of the second quarter was $5.8 billion, a large year-over-year increase and a modest sequential decline. Since last year, our backlog has increased by $1.6 billion or 38%. $1 billion of the increase was same-store and $0.6 billion was new backlog from recent acquisitions. We are entering the second half of 2024 with 25% more same-store backlog than we had at this time last year despite a roughly 30% surge in organic revenue. Our revenue mix continues to trend towards data centers, chip fab, battery plants, life science and food. Industrial customers accounted for 60% of total revenue in the first half of 2024, and they are major drivers of pipeline and backlog. Technology, which is included in industrial was 31% of our revenue, a substantial increase from 20% the prior year. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government, are also strong and represent 23% of our revenue. The commercial sector remains reasonably active in the regions that we serve, but it is now a smaller part of our business at about 17% of revenue. Most of our service revenue is for commercial customers. Of the share of our construction revenue that is commercial is not relatively small. Construction activities continue to be extraordinarily strong and our project pipelines continue at unprecedented high levels. Construction accounted for 84% of our revenue with projects for new buildings representing 59% and existing building construction 25%. We include modular in new building construction and year-to-date modular was 18% of our revenue. Service revenue was 16% of our total revenue as our service revenue increased by 10% and service profit grew by 20% this quarter. Service is a reliable source of profit and cash flow and is on track to exceed $1 billion in revenue for 2024. As noted above, we are entering the second half of 2024 with a backlog that is 25% higher on the same-store basis that we had at this time last year, and we have a superb team working hard for our customers every single day. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of our employees across the country. We are optimistic about our future. As always, I want to close by thanking our over 17,000 employees for their hard work and dedication. I'll now turn it back over to Daniel for questions. Thank you. Good morning. I think, Alex, particularly, the upcoming short-term, I think we're in pretty good shape to maintain these margins. We're getting good pricing and we're getting excellent execution in the field. And also, you can't forget, we are growing service 10% and you see profitability increase there. So I think we're pretty optimistic in the near future that we should maintain these margins. Thanks. Thanks, Adam. How are you doing? Yes, so if you look at last year, we sort of went through the same cycle. I mean, the thing you look at, we look at, Adam, is, what's the demand, what's our pipelines look like? They're robust. It's in all the markets we served. It's probably as strong. I've been doing this for 40-some years. It's probably the best market I've ever been in. So we're pretty optimistic. There's going to be plenty of work for a while. Yes. Well, first of all, the electrical company we have here was really a -- is really a superb company that Bill found for sure. They're in the four big markets that we like in Texas. We have more electricians than anyone else, and Texas is booming. We got a lot of mission-critical work, which is really in the sweet spot. So we're really humming along in that business right now and I think it'll go on for a while. All right. Take care. Thanks, Josh. I think -- if you look at the pipelines in the backlog, it's probably pretty -- been pretty consistent for the last 18 months to 2 years. We're still seeing, as we mentioned in the script, similar opportunities, data centers, pharma, life sciences, food, et cetera. So we're seeing the mix pretty consistent in the markets that we serve, and there's been no let up, Josh. Yes, Josh, that is a great question. Thanks for asking it. We really take great pride in protecting our folks from a health and safety perspective. Treat them fair, we treat them with respect. We have a lot of work for them to do, which is great for themselves and their families. But at the end of the day, we are extremely grateful for the hard work and commitment they're all making. But we really go out of our way. We're very field-focused in this company, which I'm really proud of, and we really do try to take care of them as best we can. So they like a lot of work. They like to work. So we're in a good time for them as well. So thanks -- but thanks for asking. Well, I think AI, let's say the demand for data, right, because even the AI build really only started last year, 15 months, right? There's been heavy data center construction because people were getting ready for streaming. Everybody's forgotten about that.

            "content": "Thanks Brian. So second quarter results were really remarkable. We had 30% same-store revenue growth, higher margins, good SG&A leverage and over $165 million in free cash flow. We achieved more than $200 million in quarterly EBITDA for the first time and our EBITDA doubled compared to the same quarter last year. Revenue for the second quarter of 2024 was $1.8 billion, and that is an increase of $514 million or 40% compared to last year. Our Mechanical segment revenue increased by 49%, benefiting from organic construction and service growth. Recent acquisitions and modular expansion, Electrical segment revenue increased by 12% and overall our same-store revenue increased by 30% or $383 million with the remaining $131 million of increased resulting from acquisitions. We are facing tougher prior year comparable results for the remainder of the year. Through 6 months, our same-store revenue growth has been 26% and currently our best estimate is that for full year 2024, our same-store revenue growth will be in the low to mid 20% range. Gross profit was $364 million for the second quarter of 2024, a noteworthy $136 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage grew to 20.1% this quarter compared to 17.6% for the second quarter of 2023. Quarterly gross profit percentage in our Electrical segment jumped to 23.6% this year as compared to 17% last year. Margins in our Mechanical segment also increased significantly to 19.2% as compared to 17.8% in the second quarter of 2023. EBITDA doubled to $223 million this quarter from a strong $112 million in the second quarter of 2023. Same-store EBITDA increased by over 80% and even without recent acquisitions, our EBITDA exceeded $200 million. Considering the strong ongoing demand, we expect that for 2024 EBITDA margins will continue in the strong ranges that we have achieved over the last several quarters. SG&A expense for the quarter was $180 million or 9.9% of revenue compared to $136 million or 10.5% of revenue in the second quarter of 2023. Our operating income increased by just over 100% from last year, from $92 million in the second quarter of 2023 to $185 million for the second quarter of 2024. With improved gross profit margins and favorable SG&A leverage, our operating income percentage surged to 10.2% this quarter from 7.1% in the prior year. This is the first time that we have achieved 10% OI margins in a quarter. Since I became CFO, Comfort Systems has not used adjusted numbers to make our results look better. However, today I do want to point out a notable factor in our results. Our recent acquisitions have exceeded our high expectations resulting in larger than usual earn out expense. Without the changes in the fair value of our earn out obligations this quarter, certain earnings would've been notably stronger. We always have purchase related adjustments in the periods following an acquisition, however, they currently are and likely will continue to be much larger over the next several quarters because of the significant contingent consideration opportunity included in recent transactions. Our year-to-date tax rate was 21.3%. We currently estimate that the full year 2024 tax rate will likely be in the 21% to 22% range. After considering all of these factors, net income for the second quarter of 2024 was $134 million or $3.74 per share, and this is a 90% improvement from last year. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2024 was $290 million. We continue to benefit from advanced payments for work that we will fund and complete in upcoming quarters, and operating cash flow continues to exceed our earnings by about $300 million on a trailing 12-month basis. So we are well ahead of earnings in collecting our cash. Even with two notable acquisitions earlier this year, we have succeeded in retiring all of our bank debt as of June 30, 2024, and other debt was $91 million with cash balances exceeding our debt. We also spent around $11 million on share repurchases this quarter. That's what I got, Brian. Yes, I would say every factor that is creating these margins is continuing at least as strong as it has been and in some cases continues to get stronger. So modular, like really every single part of our business, did great this quarter. And it's -- as you can see, it's growing. It's up to near 18% of our revenue and -- so its adding a percentage while the revenue is growing very quickly. So that's continued to grow. As far as the future, people have been asking a lot, are we going to make new large commitments to space. I don't think that that is something that we are taking incremental commitments. We have added incremental space within the last few months. We're more likely to do things incrementally and I do want to say that one of the things that we emphasized when we took the additional million square foot of space that we took recently, we took space that was much -- had much higher roots and was much more configured for automation. And so I think a lot of our goal is going to be to improve the production and productivity of the newly deployed space. Ultimately, comfort is going to take the amount of work we can execute. And with people -- there are businesses that you can scale easily. This is a business that you're doing things in the real world. You're delivering things that are three-storied tall and 100 yards long and have incredible complexity inside them. And you have to respect the difficulty of what you're doing and make sure we will always put our ability to keep our promises to our customers above sort of pushing for growth on the top line. Hey, Adam. So I don't know about one-off, they're just constant. So in 2021 December, there was a big commitment that was part of a really more than a year's negotiation with a large customer that induced us to make a really big investment in a million square feet of additional space. Since then, we've been able to re-keep the backlog at at least the levels that we achieved sort of in that time frame. But it's the award sort of come in as programs are completed, right? There's short, there are redesigns that happen in the products that we sell. And I don't know if it will continue, but I will say in the last 3 years, we tended to get more of the modular bookings in the winter months, sort of December, January, February, and we've had sort of a net burn in the middle of the year. We certainly had a net burn in modular this quarter, but we -- it's because we had really big bookings over the winter. And I think our prospects are good for that, but obviously it depends if people are still planning on having data and computing power, right, which we think they are. It's also important to know it's the electrical segment is not just Texas. We have unbelievable results right now in Kentucky and North Carolina. We have just fantastic electrical businesses. People need what they do. They do a great job for their customers, and they make sure that they get paid for the capacity that they can bring to bear in for the risks that they take. So it's really -- it's really to hit those kind of numbers, pretty much everybody had to be just having an amazing outcome. It's good to have electricians right now, Adam. Thanks. If you don't mind, I'll just comment on data centers. People -- there are people right now who seem to be concerned that something's happening with the data center build. What we are hearing from our customers and experiencing in the market is that they are continuing to believe in deploying data centers. They've bought a lot of very, very expensive computer chips.

So it's possible, I guess that that's slowing down, but I will say if that's happening, it's certainly not in anything that we can see or experience in our vision or our markets or in our conversations with our customers. Thank you. So, through 11 months, it was 26%. So it would be in the low mid. Seems that it would have to -- it would come down some, but maybe not down to 15%, right, if you -- if the second half was 15%, that's going to average below 20%. So we're -- it's a little stronger than that. We don't really know what's going to happen. There's a lot --\u2013 we are -- on July 1 of this year, we had 25% more booked work on a same-store basis than we had last year. So we believe we're going to have very strong growth for the full year. Our best estimate is that low-mid 20% range.

Yes, I think we have a process like most people do, go, no-go, but we're very careful to select. We're putting our valuable resources with good customers and doing good work. So it's really important that you go through your factors and selecting what work you're going to take in a market like this when there's a lot of work out there, Julio. That's a great question. It's going to be hard to get much more SG&A leverage just mathematically, right? But I do think this range is we should continue in because we're continuing to get the revenue growth. We did have notable dollar increases in SG&A this quarter. It does take money to do this work.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Julie Shaeff, Chief Accounting Officer. Please go ahead. \nJulie Shaeff: Thanks, Justin. Good morning. Welcome to Comfort Systems USA's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Our comments today as well as our press releases contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the applicable securities laws regulation. \n What we will say today is based on the current plans and expectations of Comfort Systems USA. Those plans and expectations include risks and uncertainties that might cause actual future activities and results of our operations to be materially different from those set forth in our comments. You can read a detailed listing and commentary concerning our specific risk factors in our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q as well as in our press release covering these earnings. \n A slide presentation has been provided as a companion to our remarks. This presentation is posted on the Investor Relations section of the company's website found at comfortsystemsusa.com. \n Joining me on the call today are Brian Lane, President and Chief Executive Officer; Trent McKenna, Chief Operating Officer; and Bill George, Chief Financial Officer. Brian will open our remarks. \nBrian Lane: Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. 2024 is off to an outstanding start, with strong revenue, fantastic margins and continuing strong cash flow. Our dedicated teams across the country achieved superb execution, and I am deeply grateful for their hard work and commitment. We earned $2.69 per share this quarter compared to $1.59 a year ago.  \n Our revenue was $1.5 billion with same-store growth of 23%. Our mechanical business exceeded last year, while our electrical segment achieved unprecedented margin. Backlog is $5.9 billion, up both year-over-year and sequentially on a same-store basis. Construction continues to thrive amid strong ongoing demand and service is performing at high levels.  \n In February, we closed 2 substantial acquisitions, Summit Industrial and J & S Mechanical and they, too, are off to a great start. Both of these companies are included in our mechanical segment. We also increased our dividend by 20% adding $0.05 to reach $0.30 per share. This increase reflects our continuing strong cash flow and our commitment to reward our shareholders. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes. But first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? \nWilliam George: Thanks, Brian. I can't help but also express my gratitude to the people who are working every day to create these amazing results. So as Brian noted, Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $1.5 billion, and that is an increase of $362 million or 31% compared to last year. Same-store revenue increased by 23% or $266 million, with the remaining $96 million increase resulting from acquisitions.\n Our mechanical segment revenue increased by 29% and our electrical segment revenue increased by 37%. We did not experience as much seasonality in this first quarter as we have in the past as an increasing proportion of our work is being performed in warmer climates. Additionally, weather in our colder climates was favorable for construction this quarter and with the strong growth in modular, more of our work is being performed under roof inside our modular plans.  \n We are also facing tougher prior year comparable results for the remainder of this year. However, our best estimate is that we will achieve same-store percentage revenue increases in at least the mid-teens and more likely in the high teens for the full year. Gross profit was $297 million for the first quarter of 2024, a $92 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage improved to 19.3% this quarter compared to 17.5% for the first quarter of 2023.  \n The quarterly gross profit percentage in our electrical segment improved to 22.6% this year as compared to 16.1% last year. Margins in our mechanical segment also increased in the quarter to 18.4% as compared to 17.9% in the first quarter of 2023. Our mechanical segment includes our modular business, which operates at lower margins than our remaining business.\n EBITDA improved markedly to $170 million this quarter from an already strong $90 million in the first quarter of 2023. Same-store EBITDA increased by over 70%. Although the first quarter benefited from the favorable factors I mentioned earlier, and our underlying trends are strong, we expect that for 2024, EBITDA margins will continue to trend in the strong ranges that we have achieved over the last several quarters and we are optimistic that full year EBITDA margins in 2024 will match or exceed our high 2023 results.\n Gross margin should also remain strong, but gross margin percentage may be more variable in 2024 in light of the effect of amortization and certain purchase-related adjustments. SG&A expense for the quarter was $163 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $135 million or 11.5% of revenue in the first quarter of 2023. On a same-store basis, SG&A spend was $19 million higher due to ongoing investments to support our higher activity levels.  \n Our operating income increased by 91% from last year from $71 million in the first quarter of 2023 to $135 million for the first quarter of 2024. With improved gross profit margins, and favorable SG&A leverage, our operating income percentage increased to 8.8% this quarter from 6.0% in the prior year.  \n Changes in the fair value of our earnout obligations this quarter reduced our income by $12 million, and that was caused by the variability noted earlier, and it was triggered by strong early performance at our recent acquisitions. We always have purchase-related adjustments in the periods following an acquisition; however, they will likely be much larger over the next several quarters because of the size of the Summit and J & S acquisition and the significant contingent consideration opportunities that were included in those transactions.\n Our first quarter tax rate was 21.7%. We currently estimate that the full year 2024 tax rate will likely be in the 21% to 22% range. After considering all these factors, net income for the first quarter of 2024 was $96 million or $2.69 per share. This compares to net income for the first quarter of 2023 of $57 million or $1.59 per share.  \n Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2024 was $123 million. We continue to benefit from advanced payments for work that we will fund and complete in upcoming quarters. And operating cash flow continues to exceed our earnings by about $300 million on a trailing 12-month basis. Over the coming quarters, we expect that eventually pre-bookings and equipment advances will normalize, creating some cash flow headwind. In the meantime, these collections have allowed us to invest in growth and fund acquisitions from current cash flows, while lowering interest costs.\n Our total debt, as of March 31, 2024, was $90 million with no funded debt from our banks, and that was despite large cash payments for the Summit and J & S acquisitions in February. As Brian noted, we also increased our dividend.  \n Before I close, I want to mention 1 additional item, which is not directly relevant to our financial results, but that I wanted to flag for awareness. Last night, at Texas jury returned a jury verdict because one of our subsidiaries relating to a 2019 safety incident. The jury verdict was over $70 million. And that pencils out to about $48 million for us. Assuming this jury's verdict is entered by the judge, we will pursue a number of strong appeals. Even if the appeals are unsuccessful, this event is not expected to have an impact on us financially. That's all I have, Brian. \nBrian Lane: All right. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to discuss our business and outlook. Our backlog at the end of the first quarter was a record $5.9 billion. Since last year, our backlog has increased by $1.5 billion or 33%. And about half of that increase was same-store growth, and the other half was new backlog from companies we acquired.\n Our sequential backlog increased by $754 million, of which $612 million related to acquisitions. Our same-store sequential backlog increased by $142 million and pipelines remain strong. Our revenue mix continues to trend to its data centers, chip fabrication, battery plants, life science and food.  \n Industrial customers accounted for 60% of total revenue in the first quarter and they are major drivers of pipeline and backlog. Technology, which is included in industrial, was 30% of our revenue, a substantial increase from 19% in the prior year. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government, are also strong and represent 23% of our revenue.  \n The commercial sector remains reasonably active in the regions that we serve, but it is now part -- a smaller part of our business at about 17% of revenue. The majority of our service revenue is for commercial customers. So the share of our overall construction revenue from commercial has become relatively small. Construction grew quickly and drove great results for us this quarter. \n Overall, construction accounted by 84% of our revenue with projects for new buildings representing 59% and existing building construction 25%. We include modular and new building construction. In modular, this quarter, with 16% of our revenue. Service revenue increased this quarter, but because of the growth in construction, even with the service revenue increase service fell to 16% of total revenue.  \n Service, which remains seasonal, continues to be a great source of profit and cash flow for us. Comfort Systems USA is thriving, and our team members across the country are delivering exceptional results. Thanks to their excellence and in light of the strong ongoing demand, we are optimistic that we will continue to achieve strong results in 2024.  \n Safety, execution and innovation remain at the forefront of our operations. We believe that our commitment to our employees and to building legacies is the foundation of our success. Our #1 priority is to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry. And so as always, I want to thank -- I want to close by thanking all our 16,500 employees for their hard work and dedication.  \n I will now turn it back over to Justin for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Dwyer from KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nAlexander Dwyer: Congrats on a strong start to the year. So the EBITDA margin was very strong this quarter, and the guide for this year continues to call for similar last year. Can you just talk about the potential for margin expansion over the rest of the year? Is it just that the comps get tougher in the back half? Or is there something in the recent performance that like isn't sustainable as we progress through this year? \nBrian Lane: Well, this is Brian. I'll go first and then Bill can follow up. I mean we're really pleased with the margins that we have right now. If you're in that gross margin, 18% to 20% range, I think you're executing at a high level over 19% for the quarter. So I think we're going to continue to be in that range throughout the year.  \n We'll have broad-based excellent performance across our operating companies. So I mean, might have a little fluctuation up or down as we go, but in general, our performance has just been excellent. \nWilliam George: Yes. Like as we noted in our -- in the opening comments, we're definitely anticipating expecting our EBITDA margins for the full year to stay up near last year, right? and the recent amazing results we have, and we're optimistic we can do a little better. I will say, as you pointed out, later this year, we hit some very tough comparables, right? We had extraordinary growth and increases really progressively throughout the year and especially in the second half of the year last year. So one of the things you're seeing is even though, last year, the first quarter seemed like an extraordinary quarter, and it was, it got so much better later in the year that we're just facing tougher comparables.  \n We're extremely optimistic, but they are tough comparables, and that's why we're giving that guidance. \nAlexander Dwyer: And then the organic backlog growth was very strong this quarter. Can you talk about what end markets drove that strength? And if there was any like larger modular orders in there? And do you think it's fair to assume like backlog can continue to increase sequentially through this year? \nBrian Lane: I mean, in terms of the backlog, it's broad-based. We didn't get one surge in any particular segment. It's really reassuring to us here to see multi-sectors, particularly if you're talking about the tech sector, manufacturing, education, see at the university level strong and health care, outpatient and hospitals. So we're seeing good balance across the board. \nWilliam George: And as far as what might happen in the coming quarters, I would actually surprise me at some point not to see some sequential declines, right? You can't -- especially as we get into the summer and the revenues get really big. Historically, we've always had sequential declines in the middle of the year except for lately. So I've been -- like I said, it wouldn't surprise me, but to be fair, I haven't been surprised quarter after quarter for the last several quarters. \n The demand is unmatched. There's never been more demand for our services and our guys are turning away work. But at some point, you can only take so much work. And so I think you'll see backlog stay at extremely high levels, but I don't think, you should say, yes, for sure, every sequential compare, will be up that's really not historically what happened. \nAlexander Dwyer: And then last one for me. The Summit and J & S acquisitions are off to a strong start this year. Is there anything different about the integration of them into your business, given these are so large? And then can you talk about the appetite for more deals through the year? \nBrian Lane: I'll just start on the integration. The outlies, one of a little bit of advantage you have in the outlies is that you get a little bit more horsepower in the back office to handle public company requirements. These are both very sophisticated companies, excellent workforce, great leadership. So we're working pretty closely with them to make this as smooth as possible. But -- plus they got a great attitude integrate themselves, which is a huge help. So far, off to a great start. \nWilliam George: Yes, I couldn't agree more. We -- for us, the integration, the biggest thing we try to do in integration is keep what's great about a company and keep it going and keep it that local excellence continuing. And so that's an advantage we have since we're not trying to change things. That makes integration a little easier. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. \nAdam Thalhimer: I wanted to stick on Summit and just see kind of what you're seeing so far, specifically from chip plants kind of the timing of those projects? \nWilliam George: They have great work going on and great prospects. They also have a big solar fab, and they have -- these guys can do very perfect to do the big hard work that the country needs right now. That's why we want -- we were so excited to buy them. But right now, it's full speed ahead. \nBrian Lane: Yes. You know, Adam, in terms of their skill set, they're looking at a lot of opportunities in pharmaceutics, et cetera. So this feels replicable to a whole bunch of industries. \nAdam Thalhimer: Okay. What kind of capacity growth potential do they have as you start getting more into markets? \nWilliam George: So when we buy a company, we don't push them to grow. We basically push them to do well. Well, we push them to grow their workforce to really, really put their arms around and grow their workforce, which leads to growth in almost every case. But I would not say for us, that's a growth story. I think like almost any company we buy, they will grow over time. But for us, it's just an excellence story to keep your workforce busy. \nAdam Thalhimer: And then I wanted to ask about specialty contractor capacity. Is it still -- do you think as tight now as it was kind of a year or 2 ago? And are you still booking work further out? \nBrian Lane: Yes. Adam, for sure, it's still tight. We've been very fortunate to recruit some outstanding people on the human resource side. We're attracting some great talent, but it is still tight. But we're in a good place to work. We offer great compensation package, the opportunity to develop. We like to promote from within.  \n So I think that will be a struggle for a while. But we have good work, people like working here. So I'm very optimistic about the future. \nAdam Thalhimer: All right. And Bill, just a quick modeling thing. What do you have for D&A in Q2 since we only had the acquisitions for part of Q1? \nWilliam George: So we had 2 months of those guys. I think it's -- we put -- if you look in the footnotes, we actually have a table where we tell you exactly. Well, I'm on exactly what we think it's going to be. So just you can go get the actual numbers from one of the footnotes. \nAdam Thalhimer: I was being lazy. \nWilliam George: Yes. Well, I have been lazy too because I have to go look at it myself. It's big. Like you saw the pop, right? And that was only 2 months of those guys. But you're only required to publish that schedule once a year, but we've published it -- we certainly publish it every quarter after we do an acquisition because those noncash charges, they're so -- they really -- it's crazy that we're -- that we reduced our earnings by that, right?  \n People want to know what the asset they own is doing, but GAAP is GAAP, and so that's what we do. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS. \nJoshua Chan: Congrats on a really good quarter. Could you talk about the bidding environment for potential projects that even are before backlog, anything changing there? And how is pricing on those bids that you're putting together? \nBrian Lane: Yes. So in terms of the pipeline preorder, it's still very robust, it's still broad-based. Pricing is still reasonable for sure. It's a great opportunity for us to work fo our really good customers, be very selective in the acquisition process. We don't chase revenue, chase new opportunities and the work that we're good at. But in terms of the sectors that I hit on the floor, the operations -- the opportunities are very consistent still today. \nWilliam George: No letup. \nBrian Lane: No letup. \nJoshua Chan: Okay. That's great to hear. And then on the data center side, could you just talk about how your conversations are like with your data center customers? And any kind of update in terms of your thinking on when you might be able to expand modular capacity again? \nWilliam George: These are big organizations. So you're not just talking to one part of the organization, right? You're talking to the people who desperately need the capacity and who understand how to partner with us. And you're also talking to parts of the organization whose job it is to purchase things and to try to get the lowest price.  \n I would say that things are as expected. And our -- what we try to do is just be a great partner for people. And if really we do our best work and get the best value for people who reciprocate that, but I don't know that anything has changed. Essentially, we -- they are in all paths to market mindset. So they love getting this stuff built modularly. They're hiring our contractors who build it in the traditional way. I just think that the demand is so great that they're just looking for people who can help them do what they need to do, and we love to do that for people who want to partner up. \nBrian Lane: George, I'll just add on a little bit to the opportunities. One of our strengths is the size of Comfort and the geographic spread we have opportunity is share labor, it's really an advantage that us and a few of our colleagues of the country have, give some of these larger opportunities that we can handle both financially and from a resource basis, including when you think about our suppliers, we're  a good company to do business with. So our size right now is really helping us. \nWilliam George: And we use that size to be a partner to people. Not -- we don't try to use it against people. \nBrian Lane: Right. \nJoshua Chan: Any thoughts on whether you could expand capacity at some time later this year or into next year? \nWilliam George: So if you're talking about modular, I would say that, that is not something that we are currently making plans around, but we are evaluating. \nJoshua Chan: Okay. All right. And then just a modeling question. So EBITDA margins usually go up from Q1 to Q2? I know, Bill, you mentioned the lack of seasonality in Q1, but I was just wondering your thoughts about whether you can see a typical sequential margin expansion into the next quarter. \nWilliam George: Yes. So EBITDA margins do typically go up from the first quarter to the second quarter. But first quarter have never been all-time highs by extraordinary amounts. So it's a very insecure time for us to start saying it's going to -- we're going to have sequential uptick in margins, only because of how high they are in the first quarter.  \n I'm more comfortable talking about doing better this year than last year, right? But 1 quarter -- this is a quarter where our EBITDA was up 70% on a same-store basis. We need to adjust to that in our brain. \nBrian Lane: We stick around the margins, we'll be happy folks. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Julio Romero from Sidoti & Company. \nJulio Romero: Can you maybe talk about the margins you're seeing in construction? Are they trending upward? And are you seeing any fixed cost leverage as that modular business continues to grow? \nBrian Lane: For sure, construction margins increased the back half of this year into this year, we -- there's a lot of multiple reasons for it, but the current [indiscernible] is good job selection with good customers. But I got to tell you, we're executing in the field, which has always run [indiscernible] for me at very high level, really are very grateful to the folks that go out to these jobs every day and the work they're doing. So mines are up. And to me, a lot of it's about the execution that we're getting. \nJulio Romero: Got it. Now great execution. I'm just curious if there's any kind of fixed cost leverage that you see there as that grows. \nWilliam George: Well, you saw our SG&A obviously dropped from 11.5% to 10.6%. I would say we are definitely making investments to accommodate our growth in every -- from all sorts of back office sales. But with revenue increasing the way it is, it certainly seems like our SG&A can't go up as fast as that. So I don't think you'll see worse SG&A leverage over the course of the rest of this year.  \n Now revenue increases. If we tell you we're going to be sort of in the mid-teens and more likely in the high teens in revenue increase, and we were in the 20s this quarter, that means it's going to average down some. So I would say maybe we don't get additional leverage. But -- so I don't think you'd see additional leverage sequentially, but I think year-over-year, you're going to see a ton of leverage and I don't even know that's just a guess, right? And it will -- the important part is year-over-year as far as how the math comes down into what we're doing. I hope you followed that. I think I wasn't very clear in that answer. \nJulio Romero: No, that was a good commentary. And what's your best guess as to when you see some of this cash flow reversal is expected? \nWilliam George: Well, so our history of getting that right is poor because it keeps waiting -- it keeps happening later. I'd say late this year probably at some point. There is a sense in which it did flatten because we're going to show you a slide in our investor presentation. Last quarter, we had a slide in our investor presentation that showed that we had earned, while we had cash flow $300 million more than we had earned in 2023. You're going to see at the end of the first quarter that on a trailing 12-month basis, we will have cash flow more than we have earned by $300 million, here's the thing. So the $300 million didn't go up, right? It didn't go down but we didn't get in our same-store businesses we did inherit some advanced cash from our acquisition, especially at Summit.  \n But in our same-store businesses, we didn't get farther out. So I think before you start to give some of it back, the first thing that happens is you stop getting more of it. And there were certainly signs in the first quarter that we stopped getting more of it. Having said that, we're earning so much money that cash flow -- a big -- when I looked at why our cash flow was still so big in the first quarter, in the past quarters, it's been a lot of earnings and advanced cash. This quarter, it was just a lot of earnings and not giving back advanced cash.  \n So there is signs of that flattening out as it literally has to, right? If you -- if somebody pays you to do a bunch of welding and electrical work, sooner or later, you got to go do the welding and electrical work. And the welders and the electricians, you're going to pay them. You're going to have to pay them. It's a fantastic problem to have, not really a problem. But it will look like a problem at some point because at some point in the future, our cash flow will be less than our earnings by the amount that it was more than our earnings. And it's a high-class problem. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson. \nBrent Thielman: I'm going to ask about margins, sorry. I guess -- you look at this quarter, I mean just take a step back, is the margin performance because you're getting paid more generally for what you do or that you have the perfect mix of projects where you get paid more or you're just that much more productive in the field? \nBrian Lane: I would say all 3. But the thing that we really can control on an everyday basis is how we're doing in the field and Brent you heard this from a lot of times different version of prefabrication, [indiscernible] the more work we can do sort of inside building [indiscernible] in the field, the more productive, safer, and the higher quality of the work is and we're doing more prefabrication every day. So -- but it's a combination of all 3 for sure, but we did -- we really cannot minimize how well we are in execution on a per person basis at these job sites, including service. We're talking a lot about construction. But our service folks are doing a hell of a job as well. \nWilliam George: And the other thing you got to mention is electrical, like our electrical margins popped by 600 basis points this quarter. And what was amazing about that, we had something like that 1.5 years ago where we had an extraordinary gain in the quarter. This was just a mixture of everything good that can happen to a business because they're doing a great job. And our customers really value the ability we have to go out and bring the manpower that's needed to do big jobs, and they're allowing us to really reward the people so that we can keep doing that.  \n So electrical is mind blowing, really amazing quarter. And you can say, well, is that a onetime blip? And the answer is, I wouldn't bet against them. I mean they might -- it's pretty hard to stay at this percentage, but I think they're just going to they got a long runway ahead of them of doing well. \nBrent Thielman: Okay. And just looking back, I don't think you guys have ever had a year when EBITDA margins for the rest of the year were below the first quarter. And I know the company and the mix has evolved quite a bit in the last 10 years. I heard your comment kind of perfect storm of weather both sides. But I'm just trying to unpack the reasons why we should be careful in thinking that this is tough to repeat [indiscernible] \nWilliam George: And there's one reason that we are -- our EBITDA on a same-store basis was up 70% in the first quarter. It's pretty hard to have -- see that happen and say, \"Oh yes, there's our new baseline.\" Right? So I understand. I -- we don't know what's going to happen, but these margins are for a first quarter. They are extraordinary. Now do I think we've got extraordinary margins in our future? I do. But on a comparable basis, it's a tough comparable. If we were about to hit tough comparables from the prior year, then our first quarter was comparable for the ages. But we're about to make a lot of money. We'll go for it. Yes, we'll make as much money as we can, and you can figure out what that means. \nBrent Thielman: I got an idea. Okay. I just wanted to come back to modular. I mean I think you're essentially booked in 2024. To what degree do you still have available capacity in 2025 to fill? And are conversations starting at all for 2026? \nWilliam George: I would say we believe that if we had more capacity, we could sell more than we have capacity for in '25. We have more of our capacity in '25 sold than we would have thought was possible. And we don't think people are going to -- we don't think all of these factors are going to end by '26 -- by '26 along, we don't have bookings. We don't have the floor planned for the middle of 2026. You know what I mean. Nobody is doing manpower loading schedules right now for the Winter Olympics. . \nBrent Thielman: Yes, that's a long time out. And then maybe if you could just talk about the progression with new customers and modular. I know you don't want to talk about name specifics for obvious reasons, but how are you being able to diversify the customer base in that business? \nWilliam George: So things are going great with our second large customer. We like them, they like us. The product they've designed, we think, is very, very clever and going to do a great job for them. We sold as much as we would have hoped as we could sell by now.  \n As far as diversifying the thing that keeps us from diversifying is that fantastic customers are willing to buy all of our capacity. Like we reserve a little bit of that capacity for a lot of long-time pharma customers who really rely on us to do certain things that any other people would have a hard time doing. We have to do that, right, because we owe it to them. But in general, so far, those 2 customers want all we can do. And they've earned first. Really, frankly, they've earned first look and last look. They've earned first look and last look they're great partners, absolutely. \n And so as long as they're good partners, we take what the market, we do the -- the skills we have are applicable to all kinds of things, right? It's not like -- but in our market, it's always lumpy. And it's always the case that whatever the -- there's more of something in any given year. And right now, we're sticking with guys that need what we can do, and we -- they've been great partners, and they've earned our loyalty.  \n They've asked us, what do we need to do to have all of your capacity? And we said, well, this would be what you need to do, and they've done it. And they've asked us if -- last year, they said, what do you need in order to expand your capacity? And we said, look, for to be fair to our shareholders and the risks that we take and the cost we did incur, we need these kind of commitments and they made them. And so we're keeping our commitments to them. \nBrent Thielman: Yes. Maybe just one last one, guys. I mean, I think it's obvious that the opportunities in data centers has brought a lot of attention to the company and the stock from investors. And clearly, I think it's driving a lot of growth for you. Maybe just your perspective, is that overemphasized relative to some of the other things moving the needle for your business right now? You talk about manufacturing, industrial capacity I'd just be curious to your thoughts to that. \nBrian Lane: Well, I mean, I think it's logical that people focus on data centers as you and I were turning a couple of weeks ago was everybody's favorite topic, but if you look at the other stuff we've got going on, just taking Annapolis, for example, how much pharmas going on -- food, there's a lot of sectors that are very busy in work that we're good at. When you're talking about battery plants, food, pharma, hospitals, education, university work is still very strong.  \n So I think we're seeing multi-sector activity. I think data center is going to get a lot of attention for a while. But those other sectors, we love them, winning a lot of work in them and the work is going well. \nOperator: And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Brian Lane for closing remarks. \nBrian Lane: Okay, Justin. So in closing, I really want to thank our amazing employees once again. We are really grateful for their daily efforts. We do appreciate everyone's interest on the call in our business. It's great to talk about it, and thank you.  \n I'm very optimistic about 2024. We've got great customers. We've got great people and really looking forward to how the year pans out and as well we've seen most of you on the road probably here pretty soon. So thanks for that, too. And I hope everyone has a great spring. Thanks, and enjoy your weekend. Thanks, folks. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Brian Lane",
            "content": "Thanks, Julie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today. 2024 is off to an outstanding start, with strong revenue, fantastic margins and continuing strong cash flow. Our dedicated teams across the country achieved superb execution, and I am deeply grateful for their hard work and commitment. We earned $2.69 per share this quarter compared to $1.59 a year ago.  \n Our revenue was $1.5 billion with same-store growth of 23%. Our mechanical business exceeded last year, while our electrical segment achieved unprecedented margin. Backlog is $5.9 billion, up both year-over-year and sequentially on a same-store basis. Construction continues to thrive amid strong ongoing demand and service is performing at high levels.  \n In February, we closed 2 substantial acquisitions, Summit Industrial and J & S Mechanical and they, too, are off to a great start. Both of these companies are included in our mechanical segment. We also increased our dividend by 20% adding $0.05 to reach $0.30 per share. This increase reflects our continuing strong cash flow and our commitment to reward our shareholders. I will discuss our business and outlook in a few minutes. But first, I will turn this call over to Bill to review our financial performance. Bill? All right. Thanks, Bill. I'm going to discuss our business and outlook. Our backlog at the end of the first quarter was a record $5.9 billion. Since last year, our backlog has increased by $1.5 billion or 33%. And about half of that increase was same-store growth, and the other half was new backlog from companies we acquired.\n Our sequential backlog increased by $754 million, of which $612 million related to acquisitions. Our same-store sequential backlog increased by $142 million and pipelines remain strong. Our revenue mix continues to trend to its data centers, chip fabrication, battery plants, life science and food.  \n Industrial customers accounted for 60% of total revenue in the first quarter and they are major drivers of pipeline and backlog. Technology, which is included in industrial, was 30% of our revenue, a substantial increase from 19% in the prior year. Institutional markets, which include education, health care and government, are also strong and represent 23% of our revenue.  \n The commercial sector remains reasonably active in the regions that we serve, but it is now part -- a smaller part of our business at about 17% of revenue. The majority of our service revenue is for commercial customers. So the share of our overall construction revenue from commercial has become relatively small. Construction grew quickly and drove great results for us this quarter. \n Overall, construction accounted by 84% of our revenue with projects for new buildings representing 59% and existing building construction 25%. We include modular and new building construction. In modular, this quarter, with 16% of our revenue. Service revenue increased this quarter, but because of the growth in construction, even with the service revenue increase service fell to 16% of total revenue.  \n Service, which remains seasonal, continues to be a great source of profit and cash flow for us. Comfort Systems USA is thriving, and our team members across the country are delivering exceptional results. Thanks to their excellence and in light of the strong ongoing demand, we are optimistic that we will continue to achieve strong results in 2024.  \n Safety, execution and innovation remain at the forefront of our operations. We believe that our commitment to our employees and to building legacies is the foundation of our success. Our #1 priority is to preserve and grow the best workforce in our industry. And so as always, I want to thank -- I want to close by thanking all our 16,500 employees for their hard work and dedication.  \n I will now turn it back over to Justin for questions. Well, this is Brian. I'll go first and then Bill can follow up. I mean we're really pleased with the margins that we have right now. If you're in that gross margin, 18% to 20% range, I think you're executing at a high level over 19% for the quarter. So I think we're going to continue to be in that range throughout the year.  \n We'll have broad-based excellent performance across our operating companies. So I mean, might have a little fluctuation up or down as we go, but in general, our performance has just been excellent. I mean, in terms of the backlog, it's broad-based. We didn't get one surge in any particular segment. It's really reassuring to us here to see multi-sectors, particularly if you're talking about the tech sector, manufacturing, education, see at the university level strong and health care, outpatient and hospitals. So we're seeing good balance across the board. I'll just start on the integration. The outlies, one of a little bit of advantage you have in the outlies is that you get a little bit more horsepower in the back office to handle public company requirements. These are both very sophisticated companies, excellent workforce, great leadership. So we're working pretty closely with them to make this as smooth as possible. But -- plus they got a great attitude integrate themselves, which is a huge help. So far, off to a great start. Yes. You know, Adam, in terms of their skill set, they're looking at a lot of opportunities in pharmaceutics, et cetera. So this feels replicable to a whole bunch of industries. Yes. Adam, for sure, it's still tight. We've been very fortunate to recruit some outstanding people on the human resource side. We're attracting some great talent, but it is still tight. But we're in a good place to work. We offer great compensation package, the opportunity to develop. We like to promote from within.  \n So I think that will be a struggle for a while. But we have good work, people like working here. So I'm very optimistic about the future. Yes. So in terms of the pipeline preorder, it's still very robust, it's still broad-based. Pricing is still reasonable for sure. It's a great opportunity for us to work fo our really good customers, be very selective in the acquisition process. We don't chase revenue, chase new opportunities and the work that we're good at. But in terms of the sectors that I hit on the floor, the operations -- the opportunities are very consistent still today. No letup. George, I'll just add on a little bit to the opportunities. One of our strengths is the size of Comfort and the geographic spread we have opportunity is share labor, it's really an advantage that us and a few of our colleagues of the country have, give some of these larger opportunities that we can handle both financially and from a resource basis, including when you think about our suppliers, we're  a good company to do business with. So our size right now is really helping us. Right. We stick around the margins, we'll be happy folks. For sure, construction margins increased the back half of this year into this year, we -- there's a lot of multiple reasons for it, but the current [indiscernible] is good job selection with good customers. But I got to tell you, we're executing in the field, which has always run [indiscernible] for me at very high level, really are very grateful to the folks that go out to these jobs every day and the work they're doing. So mines are up. And to me, a lot of it's about the execution that we're getting. I would say all 3. But the thing that we really can control on an everyday basis is how we're doing in the field and Brent you heard this from a lot of times different version of prefabrication, [indiscernible] the more work we can do sort of inside building [indiscernible] in the field, the more productive, safer, and the higher quality of the work is and we're doing more prefabrication every day. So -- but it's a combination of all 3 for sure, but we did -- we really cannot minimize how well we are in execution on a per person basis at these job sites, including service. We're talking a lot about construction. But our service folks are doing a hell of a job as well. Well, I mean, I think it's logical that people focus on data centers as you and I were turning a couple of weeks ago was everybody's favorite topic, but if you look at the other stuff we've got going on, just taking Annapolis, for example, how much pharmas going on -- food, there's a lot of sectors that are very busy in work that we're good at. When you're talking about battery plants, food, pharma, hospitals, education, university work is still very strong.  \n So I think we're seeing multi-sector activity. I think data center is going to get a lot of attention for a while. But those other sectors, we love them, winning a lot of work in them and the work is going well. Okay, Justin. So in closing, I really want to thank our amazing employees once again. We are really grateful for their daily efforts. We do appreciate everyone's interest on the call in our business. It's great to talk about it, and thank you.  \n I'm very optimistic about 2024. We've got great customers. We've got great people and really looking forward to how the year pans out and as well we've seen most of you on the road probably here pretty soon. So thanks for that, too. And I hope everyone has a great spring. Thanks, and enjoy your weekend. Thanks, folks."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. I can't help but also express my gratitude to the people who are working every day to create these amazing results. So as Brian noted, Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $1.5 billion, and that is an increase of $362 million or 31% compared to last year. Same-store revenue increased by 23% or $266 million, with the remaining $96 million increase resulting from acquisitions.\n Our mechanical segment revenue increased by 29% and our electrical segment revenue increased by 37%. We did not experience as much seasonality in this first quarter as we have in the past as an increasing proportion of our work is being performed in warmer climates. Additionally, weather in our colder climates was favorable for construction this quarter and with the strong growth in modular, more of our work is being performed under roof inside our modular plans.  \n We are also facing tougher prior year comparable results for the remainder of this year. However, our best estimate is that we will achieve same-store percentage revenue increases in at least the mid-teens and more likely in the high teens for the full year. Gross profit was $297 million for the first quarter of 2024, a $92 million improvement compared to a year ago. Our gross profit percentage improved to 19.3% this quarter compared to 17.5% for the first quarter of 2023.  \n The quarterly gross profit percentage in our electrical segment improved to 22.6% this year as compared to 16.1% last year. Margins in our mechanical segment also increased in the quarter to 18.4% as compared to 17.9% in the first quarter of 2023. Our mechanical segment includes our modular business, which operates at lower margins than our remaining business.\n EBITDA improved markedly to $170 million this quarter from an already strong $90 million in the first quarter of 2023. Same-store EBITDA increased by over 70%. Although the first quarter benefited from the favorable factors I mentioned earlier, and our underlying trends are strong, we expect that for 2024, EBITDA margins will continue to trend in the strong ranges that we have achieved over the last several quarters and we are optimistic that full year EBITDA margins in 2024 will match or exceed our high 2023 results.\n Gross margin should also remain strong, but gross margin percentage may be more variable in 2024 in light of the effect of amortization and certain purchase-related adjustments. SG&A expense for the quarter was $163 million or 10.6% of revenue compared to $135 million or 11.5% of revenue in the first quarter of 2023. On a same-store basis, SG&A spend was $19 million higher due to ongoing investments to support our higher activity levels.  \n Our operating income increased by 91% from last year from $71 million in the first quarter of 2023 to $135 million for the first quarter of 2024. With improved gross profit margins, and favorable SG&A leverage, our operating income percentage increased to 8.8% this quarter from 6.0% in the prior year.  \n Changes in the fair value of our earnout obligations this quarter reduced our income by $12 million, and that was caused by the variability noted earlier, and it was triggered by strong early performance at our recent acquisitions. We always have purchase-related adjustments in the periods following an acquisition; however, they will likely be much larger over the next several quarters because of the size of the Summit and J & S acquisition and the significant contingent consideration opportunities that were included in those transactions.\n Our first quarter tax rate was 21.7%. We currently estimate that the full year 2024 tax rate will likely be in the 21% to 22% range. After considering all these factors, net income for the first quarter of 2024 was $96 million or $2.69 per share. This compares to net income for the first quarter of 2023 of $57 million or $1.59 per share.  \n Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2024 was $123 million. We continue to benefit from advanced payments for work that we will fund and complete in upcoming quarters. And operating cash flow continues to exceed our earnings by about $300 million on a trailing 12-month basis. Over the coming quarters, we expect that eventually pre-bookings and equipment advances will normalize, creating some cash flow headwind. In the meantime, these collections have allowed us to invest in growth and fund acquisitions from current cash flows, while lowering interest costs.\n Our total debt, as of March 31, 2024, was $90 million with no funded debt from our banks, and that was despite large cash payments for the Summit and J & S acquisitions in February. As Brian noted, we also increased our dividend.  \n Before I close, I want to mention 1 additional item, which is not directly relevant to our financial results, but that I wanted to flag for awareness. Last night, at Texas jury returned a jury verdict because one of our subsidiaries relating to a 2019 safety incident. The jury verdict was over $70 million. And that pencils out to about $48 million for us. Assuming this jury's verdict is entered by the judge, we will pursue a number of strong appeals. Even if the appeals are unsuccessful, this event is not expected to have an impact on us financially. That's all I have, Brian. Yes. Like as we noted in our -- in the opening comments, we're definitely anticipating expecting our EBITDA margins for the full year to stay up near last year, right? and the recent amazing results we have, and we're optimistic we can do a little better. I will say, as you pointed out, later this year, we hit some very tough comparables, right? We had extraordinary growth and increases really progressively throughout the year and especially in the second half of the year last year. So one of the things you're seeing is even though, last year, the first quarter seemed like an extraordinary quarter, and it was, it got so much better later in the year that we're just facing tougher comparables.  \n We're extremely optimistic, but they are tough comparables, and that's why we're giving that guidance. And as far as what might happen in the coming quarters, I would actually surprise me at some point not to see some sequential declines, right? You can't -- especially as we get into the summer and the revenues get really big. Historically, we've always had sequential declines in the middle of the year except for lately. So I've been -- like I said, it wouldn't surprise me, but to be fair, I haven't been surprised quarter after quarter for the last several quarters. \n The demand is unmatched. There's never been more demand for our services and our guys are turning away work. But at some point, you can only take so much work. And so I think you'll see backlog stay at extremely high levels, but I don't think, you should say, yes, for sure, every sequential compare, will be up that's really not historically what happened. Yes, I couldn't agree more. We -- for us, the integration, the biggest thing we try to do in integration is keep what's great about a company and keep it going and keep it that local excellence continuing. And so that's an advantage we have since we're not trying to change things. That makes integration a little easier. They have great work going on and great prospects. They also have a big solar fab, and they have -- these guys can do very perfect to do the big hard work that the country needs right now. That's why we want -- we were so excited to buy them. But right now, it's full speed ahead. So when we buy a company, we don't push them to grow. We basically push them to do well. Well, we push them to grow their workforce to really, really put their arms around and grow their workforce, which leads to growth in almost every case. But I would not say for us, that's a growth story. I think like almost any company we buy, they will grow over time. But for us, it's just an excellence story to keep your workforce busy. So we had 2 months of those guys. I think it's -- we put -- if you look in the footnotes, we actually have a table where we tell you exactly. Well, I'm on exactly what we think it's going to be. So just you can go get the actual numbers from one of the footnotes. Yes. Well, I have been lazy too because I have to go look at it myself. It's big. Like you saw the pop, right? And that was only 2 months of those guys. But you're only required to publish that schedule once a year, but we've published it -- we certainly publish it every quarter after we do an acquisition because those noncash charges, they're so -- they really -- it's crazy that we're -- that we reduced our earnings by that, right?  \n People want to know what the asset they own is doing, but GAAP is GAAP, and so that's what we do. No letup. These are big organizations. So you're not just talking to one part of the organization, right? You're talking to the people who desperately need the capacity and who understand how to partner with us. And you're also talking to parts of the organization whose job it is to purchase things and to try to get the lowest price.  \n I would say that things are as expected. And our -- what we try to do is just be a great partner for people. And if really we do our best work and get the best value for people who reciprocate that, but I don't know that anything has changed. Essentially, we -- they are in all paths to market mindset. So they love getting this stuff built modularly. They're hiring our contractors who build it in the traditional way. I just think that the demand is so great that they're just looking for people who can help them do what they need to do, and we love to do that for people who want to partner up. And we use that size to be a partner to people. Not -- we don't try to use it against people. So if you're talking about modular, I would say that, that is not something that we are currently making plans around, but we are evaluating. Yes. So EBITDA margins do typically go up from the first quarter to the second quarter. But first quarter have never been all-time highs by extraordinary amounts. So it's a very insecure time for us to start saying it's going to -- we're going to have sequential uptick in margins, only because of how high they are in the first quarter.  \n I'm more comfortable talking about doing better this year than last year, right? But 1 quarter -- this is a quarter where our EBITDA was up 70% on a same-store basis. We need to adjust to that in our brain. Well, you saw our SG&A obviously dropped from 11.5% to 10.6%. I would say we are definitely making investments to accommodate our growth in every -- from all sorts of back office sales. But with revenue increasing the way it is, it certainly seems like our SG&A can't go up as fast as that. So I don't think you'll see worse SG&A leverage over the course of the rest of this year.  \n Now revenue increases. If we tell you we're going to be sort of in the mid-teens and more likely in the high teens in revenue increase, and we were in the 20s this quarter, that means it's going to average down some. So I would say maybe we don't get additional leverage. But -- so I don't think you'd see additional leverage sequentially, but I think year-over-year, you're going to see a ton of leverage and I don't even know that's just a guess, right? And it will -- the important part is year-over-year as far as how the math comes down into what we're doing. I hope you followed that. I think I wasn't very clear in that answer. Well, so our history of getting that right is poor because it keeps waiting -- it keeps happening later. I'd say late this year probably at some point. There is a sense in which it did flatten because we're going to show you a slide in our investor presentation. Last quarter, we had a slide in our investor presentation that showed that we had earned, while we had cash flow $300 million more than we had earned in 2023. You're going to see at the end of the first quarter that on a trailing 12-month basis, we will have cash flow more than we have earned by $300 million, here's the thing. So the $300 million didn't go up, right? It didn't go down but we didn't get in our same-store businesses we did inherit some advanced cash from our acquisition, especially at Summit.  \n But in our same-store businesses, we didn't get farther out. So I think before you start to give some of it back, the first thing that happens is you stop getting more of it. And there were certainly signs in the first quarter that we stopped getting more of it. Having said that, we're earning so much money that cash flow -- a big -- when I looked at why our cash flow was still so big in the first quarter, in the past quarters, it's been a lot of earnings and advanced cash. This quarter, it was just a lot of earnings and not giving back advanced cash.  \n So there is signs of that flattening out as it literally has to, right? If you -- if somebody pays you to do a bunch of welding and electrical work, sooner or later, you got to go do the welding and electrical work. And the welders and the electricians, you're going to pay them. You're going to have to pay them. It's a fantastic problem to have, not really a problem. But it will look like a problem at some point because at some point in the future, our cash flow will be less than our earnings by the amount that it was more than our earnings. And it's a high-class problem. And the other thing you got to mention is electrical, like our electrical margins popped by 600 basis points this quarter. And what was amazing about that, we had something like that 1.5 years ago where we had an extraordinary gain in the quarter. This was just a mixture of everything good that can happen to a business because they're doing a great job. And our customers really value the ability we have to go out and bring the manpower that's needed to do big jobs, and they're allowing us to really reward the people so that we can keep doing that.  \n So electrical is mind blowing, really amazing quarter. And you can say, well, is that a onetime blip? And the answer is, I wouldn't bet against them. I mean they might -- it's pretty hard to stay at this percentage, but I think they're just going to they got a long runway ahead of them of doing well. And there's one reason that we are -- our EBITDA on a same-store basis was up 70% in the first quarter. It's pretty hard to have -- see that happen and say, \"Oh yes, there's our new baseline.\" Right? So I understand. I -- we don't know what's going to happen, but these margins are for a first quarter. They are extraordinary. Now do I think we've got extraordinary margins in our future? I do. But on a comparable basis, it's a tough comparable. If we were about to hit tough comparables from the prior year, then our first quarter was comparable for the ages. But we're about to make a lot of money. We'll go for it. Yes, we'll make as much money as we can, and you can figure out what that means. I would say we believe that if we had more capacity, we could sell more than we have capacity for in '25. We have more of our capacity in '25 sold than we would have thought was possible. And we don't think people are going to -- we don't think all of these factors are going to end by '26 -- by '26 along, we don't have bookings. We don't have the floor planned for the middle of 2026. You know what I mean. Nobody is doing manpower loading schedules right now for the Winter Olympics. . So things are going great with our second large customer. We like them, they like us. The product they've designed, we think, is very, very clever and going to do a great job for them. We sold as much as we would have hoped as we could sell by now.  \n As far as diversifying the thing that keeps us from diversifying is that fantastic customers are willing to buy all of our capacity. Like we reserve a little bit of that capacity for a lot of long-time pharma customers who really rely on us to do certain things that any other people would have a hard time doing. We have to do that, right, because we owe it to them. But in general, so far, those 2 customers want all we can do. And they've earned first. Really, frankly, they've earned first look and last look. They've earned first look and last look they're great partners, absolutely. \n And so as long as they're good partners, we take what the market, we do the -- the skills we have are applicable to all kinds of things, right? It's not like -- but in our market, it's always lumpy. And it's always the case that whatever the -- there's more of something in any given year. And right now, we're sticking with guys that need what we can do, and we -- they've been great partners, and they've earned our loyalty.  \n They've asked us, what do we need to do to have all of your capacity? And we said, well, this would be what you need to do, and they've done it. And they've asked us if -- last year, they said, what do you need in order to expand your capacity? And we said, look, for to be fair to our shareholders and the risks that we take and the cost we did incur, we need these kind of commitments and they made them. And so we're keeping our commitments to them."
