Fourth quarter 2020 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company\u2019s Web site at mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC Web site.\nDan Glaser: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. 2020 was a year like no other and Marsh & McLennan\u2019s response and performance was nothing short of remarkable in these circumstances. The year was characterized by tough choices that we made as a business and as individuals. Our colleagues rose to the occasion and demonstrated resilience, courage, agility, collaboration and empathy in the face of the global pandemic and social unrest. Times like these validate our purpose to make a difference in the moments that matter for our clients, colleagues and communities, and we did exactly that. Our 2020 adjusted EPS growth of 7% is impressive in one of the worst economic recessions ever. Our strong financial performance also enabled us to continue to invest for the future. We continue to develop digital technologies to offer more robust client solutions. We made a number of strategic hires and achieved a record year of acquired revenue with MMA through eight acquisitions, with approximately 235 million of annualized revenue.  Looking forward, while the global pandemic will most likely dominate at least the first half of 2021, there are brighter days ahead. Our proprietary pandemic navigator model predicts that as vaccines are rolled out and we move closer to herd immunity, through natural immunity, infection case counts and vaccinations, the U.S. and UK could see a return to more normal patterns sometime in the back half of the year. As we emerge from the crisis, clients around the world can rely on our expertise, with the three areas that are critical for every organization, risk, strategy and people. The World Economic Forum's Annual Global Risks Report which was released last week and prepared with the support of Marsh & McLennan and other partners highlight some of the most likely and impactful risks facing the world today, and we are working with clients to navigate these issues.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. We're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which was strong despite the challenges of 2020. We grew our top line, delivered solid earnings growth and entered 2021 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Consolidated revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter to 4.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 1%. Operating income was 571 million, while adjusted operating income was 855 million. Our adjusted operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 21.3%. GAAP EPS was $0.73 and adjusted EPS was $1.19. Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue grew 6% to 2.5 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis, or 4%, excluding the impact of a decline in fiduciary interest. We are pleased with this excellent finish to the year, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business in the face of the pandemic. Adjusted operating income decreased 5% to 525 million and the adjusted margin contracted 220 basis points to 23.5%, reflecting the expected increase in expense in the fourth quarter.  For the year, revenue was 10.3 billion, an increase of 8% with solid underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income growth for the year was impressive at 14%, and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 170 basis points to 28%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 7% to 2.4 billion increasing 4% on an underlying basis. In the U.S. and Canada division, underlying growth was 7% for the quarter and 5% for the full year, driven by strength across the portfolio. 2020 represents the third straight year of 5% or higher underlying growth in U.S. and Canada. In the international division, underlying revenue was flat in the quarter with Latin America up 3%, Asia Pacific up 1% and EMEA down 2%. For the full year, revenue at Marsh was 8.6 billion, an increase of 7% or 3% on an underlying basis.\nDan Glaser: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we\u2019re ready to go to the Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. . Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question was on the outlook for 2021. You guys pointed to 3% to 5% overall organic revenue growth. Just trying to get a sense embedded in that, what\u2019s the views for RIS versus consulting. And then given that you guys obviously expect the economy to start to rebound, I think you said, Dan, in the second quarter, but should we assume that the growth is better in the back three quarters than the Q1?\nDan Glaser: Yes, it's a good question, Elyse. We were 3% to 5% growth on an underlying basis for 10 straight years before 2020. And so we feel that it's actually really positive that we're believing we will return to that 3% to 5% growth in 2021. The difference between RIS and consulting has more to do with what's happening in the global economy and macro factors, business confidence. Obviously, as demonstrated this year, the RIS business is a bit more resilient with higher levels of recurring revenues in the consulting business. But we're still hopeful actually that we will grow our consulting business in 2021 in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman, and that's actually our plan. We do expect that there would be more strength from the second quarter onwards, because the first quarter, you're basically comparing a pre-COVID world with a COVID world. And so there will be some challenges within that. But we've got some pretty decent momentum that we built throughout the year. And so we're expecting a good year in 2021. As we mentioned in the script, we expect that margin expansion for the year and we also expect solid adjusted EPS growth.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question I guess is also on the other component of guidance, the margin improvement. You guys did, like you said, a pretty good job of managing your expenses during the second and the third quarter. Sounds like there was a little bit more reinvestment, some stuff that got put off I think you said in the fourth quarter. So I guess the same question I was thinking about on the margin side. It sounds like maybe there could be constraints on the Q2 and the Q3, because those are pretty tough comps. But I guess that's one part of the question. And then the same thing, are you implying, Dan, since you said, potentially growth in both consulting and RIS that both segments could see margin improvement in 2021?\nDan Glaser: Our margin improvement in 2021 will in part be a function of where organic growth is. When we look at it, you say we did a pretty good job of the second quarter. My God, we rattled back expenses fast. Expense growth was down 5% in the second quarter, 4% in the third quarter. So I think it was a remarkable job. Not impacting the business itself, continuing to invest in the business, but managing our expenses aggressively and setting a very high bar for what was required in the midst of a real crisis, a real global crisis. And so the fourth quarter represents to us of getting back not quite to normal, but looking at pacing the way we normally would do. A little inside baseball in that we -- clearly we did a number of strategic hiring in the fourth quarter. We're actually up 500 or actually close to 500 headcount in the fourth quarter. And so we're positioned well for 2021. I'm not worried about quarter-by-quarter comparisons looking at 2021 versus 2020, because 2020 in a lot of ways is such a unique, bizarre type of year. So we're going to run our business the way we run our business as we usually do, where revenue growth exceeds expense growth in almost every quarter, and certainly in every year as it has done for the last 13 years. So, I know that the entire firm was very interested in doing our best to turn the page on 2020 and focus on 2021. And in the fourth quarter, we started really focusing on what that would mean. So I think we're positioned to grow decently in both. Whether our margin goes up in both segments or not, I'm not going to really talk about right now. Our expectation is that we will grow margins. Now, are we going to grow margins to the extent that we did as an overall company in 2020? Well, that would be a very tall ask, bearing in mind all the expenses that were pulled back in the second and third quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.\nMike Zaremski: Hi. Good morning. I guess I'll ask the expense question a little differently. You said remarkable job kind of pulling back on expenses. So, I guess do you feel that or any kind of lessons or things that you think that can expense wise or operating leverage wise can kind of persist permanently, or are you saying kind of the relationship between revenues and expenses kind of hopefully just goes back to the old relationship as the world opens up and things get back to normal?\nDan Glaser: It's a complicated question, but I think the answer is both. I do think we will return to a more normal pattern to where we look at revenue growth in the 3% to 5% area. Our expense growth for a number of years, four out of the last five years before 2020, was average \u2013 was not average. It was actually 2% growth. So our expense growth normally would be around 2% as it's been. Now some years it might be 3%, some years it might be 1%, but ultimately I think that's the more normal pattern. We do see the opportunity of certain things that we've learned during this year, during the year 2020 to continue. Clearly, when you think about things like where a business is filled with knowledge workers and subject matter experts, so remote working is manageable for us. So our choice of returning to offices is just that. It's a choice. We think it's better for the business. We expect our offices, physical offices to remain really the hub of activity in Marsh & McLennan. But having said that, we also think that over a period of a few years that we would be able to reduce our footprint a bit, and that would actually benefit shareholders but it would also benefit colleagues by making their life a bit more flexible and a bit easier. So certainly, that's an area of having a more actual real estate footprint is an example. We also operated much faster and more connected during COVID than we did previously. And there's an efficiency gain with that that we absolutely want to keep. I don\u2019t think T&E. I think it's going to be a while before travel snaps back to the levels that we had in like 2019. And maybe it will be quite a while. I do expect people, once this COVID clears and the crisis is over, to return to travel to see markets and to see clients, but maybe we won't travel quite as much in the past like we used to, and maybe we won't jump on an airplane at a moment's notice. It could be more like, well, let's talk on Zoom, because everybody's used to that now. So I do think that there is lasting efficiency gain which will benefit shareholders in the post COVID world.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, great. And last, a follow up switching gears a little bit to some of the more consulting centric businesses. I guess a lot of the questions we get are about whether organic will kind of succumb to some cost cutting actions some corporations are taking. I guess on the other hand, there seems to be a lot of uncertainty out there, which sometimes can lead to a new political administration, which could actually be a tailwind for parts of your consulting businesses. So maybe you can kind of talk through some of the pluses and minuses you\u2019re seeing? Thanks.\nDan Glaser: Sure. I\u2019ll lead that off and then I'll hand off to Martine and Scott who can give you a little bit more detail. Our consulting businesses, yes, they have less recurring revenue and parts of the career business and Oliver Wyman are project based. But having said that, they're resilient businesses and there's still plenty of activity as demonstrated versus performance through the year, which was minus 3, but much stronger, minus 3 the last three quarters and actually minus 1 for the year, which actually is much stronger than during the financial crisis. And areas like health and investments, retirement security are lasting and have resilience in and of themselves. Oliver Wyman's pop in the fourth quarter was a bit unexpected for us and it gave us -- usually as I've mentioned before, they tend to be a bit of a canary in the coal mine as the business confidence and thoughts. And so let me go to Martine first and then Scott who can give you a little bit more flavor for how they see growth in their business in 2020. Martine?\nMartine Ferland: Yes. Well, thanks, Ben and Mike for the question. Actually we're pleased, as Dan said, about the new business activities that we've seen in the current challenging circumstances. And we look at what the world needs right now in terms of redefining the world of work, addressing health challenges. And also we've seen quite a lot of demand in the investment solutions side of our portfolio. We've closed the year at a record level of assets under management at $357 billion. So I'd say health has been resilient through the crisis. We grew 2%. And we see a bright spot there in terms of digital solutions demand for virtual care, mental health, for example, or workforce communication. As I said, wealth, of course, we have the structural decline in the defined benefit, but that has slowed down a bit during 2020. And we've seen a lot of project work related to market volatility. So that could continue. But definitely our investment solutions are very much in demand. And then for us, career is our most discretionary project work business, in particular on the service side of career. But career usually rebound with the economy. And as Dan said in his remarks, we expect the economy recovery to come back at least in part of H2 and therefore -- and we are seeing some strength in the career pipeline. We've seen that in Q4. So all-in-all, I think our services are very relevant for the times. We're watching, of course, the agenda from the Biden administration. But we think that we are well positioned there. In particular, we are very strong in ESG, like diversity and inclusion consulting and also on responsible investment, and helping clients address the transition to a low carbon economy. So I think as soon as the economy comes back, I think we should see a good rebound.\nDan Glaser: Thank you, Martine. Scott, let\u2019s talk a little bit about how you see 2021.\nScott McDonald: Yes, sure, Dan and Mike. From an underlying perspective, we had a very strong Q4 and we had strong business activity across most segments of the business and real particular strengths in areas like financial services, health, the public sector and our actuarial and living cost businesses. And the type of business we're doing was really broad based. And it ranged all the way from growth strategies and digital transformation to the other end of restructuring and bankruptcy. I think the lesson I'm drawing from that is that there's a lot to do out there as businesses recover after the pandemic and they rebuild, they grow, they evolve, transform. Oliver Wyman also tends to focus on big companies, which have performed relatively better than small companies over the last period. Looking into the new year, our new sales in the pipeline are also strong. But as you said in your question, clients are facing significant uncertainty as they hopefully managed through the last leg to the pandemic. But looking at to the whole year, I think the first quarter could be challenging. But beyond that, I feel really good about our business, our prospects and our ability to grow. Companies are certainly challenged and they've got at least another quarter or more of challenge and uncertainty. But they have a lot to do. They need a lot of support. And I think between Oliver Wyman and Mercer, we have many of the things they need.\nDan Glaser: Thanks, Scott. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.\nPhil Stefano: Yes, thanks. I want to go back to the expenses for a moment. And I think last quarter, the commentary was that it would be up sequentially, but maybe not to the extent that we saw on a year-over-year basis, and it feels like it was higher than that. And I was hoping you could talk around -- my suspicion is there was an opportunity for investment or hiring. Maybe you can better flush that out.\nDan Glaser: It's a good question, Phil. And it's a good catch. My expectation on the call for our third quarter was that expenses would kick in the fourth quarter, but they would still be negative on a year-over-year basis. And actually they're positive on a year-over-year basis. Our expenses grew 1.5% or 2% in the fourth quarter. So it was a bit of a surprise. There\u2019s two factors underneath that. One, we didn't expect Oliver Wyman to grow in the fourth quarter and Oliver Wyman grew. And as I've mentioned before, they have the most variable compensation model. And so when they're growing, that's when we build in more on terms of variable comp. So that was something that we did. And the hiring that we did in the fourth quarter on the strategic recruitment side was higher than what we expected. We see a lot of opportunities out there. And as I mentioned, we're up nearly 500 headcount on a net basis in the fourth quarter. So that was a little bit more. So those are the two factors that contributed to us having expenses. It's important to point out, neither of those factors in and of themselves are one way. Certainly with the strategic improvement, we expect revenue over time as a result of building out our headcount as we've done for many years in a row. And the variable comp increase in OW to me is a good news story, because it's attached to growth. And so I would love for that to continue, because it would signify that we're growing the top line in Oliver Wyman.\nPhil Stefano: Okay. And dialing in on the RIS international businesses, to what extent do the different regions within there have different organic growth profiles in the short run? And I'm trying to think through the various regions\u2019 ability to manage vaccinations, to adopt stimulus programs and things like that? Should we see significant difference in these regions as we look in the very short term?\nDan Glaser: Yes, it's a good question. And I'll start it off and then I'll hand over to John who's got the biggest international footprint and also to Peter so he can weigh in as to what he's seeing in different parts of the world and expectation levels. Let's bear in mind, just to start, our top six countries represent about 75% to 77% of our revenue. So you look at the United States, UK, Canada, Australia, France and Germany, that\u2019s a big part of our company. And so it's pretty developed economies stuff. But we always have some level of variability, as you mentioned, and there's going to be different rollouts and there's going to be different timing as to when the individual countries return to normal. But, John, how do you see regional growth patterns as you go forward into 2021?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, and thank you for the question. Look, we expect a better growth trajectory in the international business in 2021. Of course, the economic outlook matters. And many parts of the world struggled more from an economic perspective as a byproduct, of course, of the pandemic saw maybe less government intervention to support the economies. What I would say, too, internationally, at least in many markets, maybe not the UK, maybe not Australia, or some other more developed markets, a lot of premium spend can be quite discretionary. And so you have liability environments that are very, very different than the countries that I mentioned earlier. And we also saw less price and less rate increase in many of those markets as well. So I think overall, I would expect less premium growth from an insurer perspective internationally than what we saw in the U.S. where as you saw, we had very, very strong revenue growth this year. But again, I'm optimistic about '21. It should be a better year.\nDan Glaser: Thanks, John. Peter, you want to give us Guy Carpenter's perspective of regional growth patterns?\nPeter Hearn: Sure. Our 2020 international business was fantastic. We had strong double digit growth in Latin America, Asia Pacific, EMEA operations, our UK operations. And it's fascinating because we have not seen any weakness in the underlying subject premium basis from our clients. And quite frankly, uncertainty creates demand in the reinsurance business. The uncertainty created by COVID and the potential loss magnitude has increased demand in all of our businesses. But for the first time in a long time, our international businesses have all grown by strong double digits. And we see the same thing for 2021.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. So first just a question on capital deployment. I think you mentioned 3.5 billion. And I guess about 1 billion of that will be used for dividends, about 0.5 billion for debt retirement, so the remaining 2 billion. Should we assume that buybacks will be consistent with what you've done in the past which is sort of offset the -- or keep the share count constant or go down a little bit, or would you consider being more active, either based on the stock price or just your deal pipeline?\nDan Glaser: Sure. Thanks, Jimmy. So Mark mentioned that we will deploy approximately 3.5 billion of capital in 2021. And Mark, you want to take that question and give a little bit of our philosophy how we\u2019re thinking about that?\nMark McGivney: Sure. Jimmy, your math is good. The 3.5 billion; your 1 billion for dividends, 0.5 billion in debt paydown and your remainder of 2 billion. As I said earlier and as we've said consistently, we favor acquisitions. And so as we think about that, that $2 billion bucket, the lean is going to be M&A. Our M&A pipeline is good. But I would say we do expect a meaningful amount of share repurchases. Just the exact amount is really going to depend on the strength of the M&A pipeline as we go through the year.\nJimmy Bhullar: And how is just the competition for deals and sort of availability of attractive properties, because there does seem to be a lot of interest and there's ongoing consolidation in the market?\nMark McGivney: Yes. Jimmy, we\u2019re the market leader. We don't compete an awful lot for assets in the marketplace in any kind of competitive bidding processes. At the end, the majority of companies that we acquire were in exclusive negotiations. And their decision oftentimes is, are they going to come with Marsh & McLennan or will they remain private. That is how it works on the majority of ours. So we're not chasing deals. And frankly, if a company is debating whether they should sell to us as a combination that would help them grow better and give better career path into their colleague base and they\u2019re viewing that as to what about private equity as an example, as an alternative, then they were not ready for really that conversation. At the end, we like doing transactions in which we're not selling ourselves and they're not selling themselves. We're deciding in combination that working together will enable more flow for the combined operation on a go-forward basis. So we're highly selected. We're not doing dozens and dozens of deals, as you see that takes place out there in the market. And as I said, most of our acquisitions were in some element of exclusive discussion.\nDan Glaser: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Dan, I don't know if you mentioned this before and I missed it, but the nearly 500 headcount increase in the fourth quarter, was that more weighted towards RIS or consulting?\nDan Glaser: Yes. At the end, I don't have the precise number for you. My view in it would be RIS weighted. But consulting, we intend -- if I look at our overall headcount for the total company in 2020, it is up slightly versus 2019. So it's not that we've emptied the cupboard and then we've achieved our margin expansion in 2020 in a way that's going to impact us negatively into the future. We are well prepared for a rebound. And certainly RIS had a very strong year and is the market leader. And so we are the employer of choice in the industry and we have a lot of opportunities to build our headcount with really quality subject matter experts and producing people as we go forward.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that's helpful. On a different topic, I guess you and Martine mentioned the record assets under management. Can you give us a framework for how we should think about that impacting earnings?\nDan Glaser: Sure. It's not a direct read-through. Obviously, with AUM growing, we earn more revenue generally from that. It also creates a bit more volatility to us as we go forward. But it's very much a good news story. I think the CAGR on AUM mid 20s over the last five years or so. So, Martine, how should Meyer and others think about AUM when it comes down to what does it mean for Mercer's business?\nMartine Ferland: Yes. Well, it's definitely a very strong suit for us, and also the demand through the COVID crisis has increased. We\u2019ve seen the same on the global financial crisis. When the market becomes more uncertain, the demand for improved governance and transaction agility really drive demand for us, and we're seeing this. So we had very, very strong inflows in 2020. We're seeing a very good pipeline for 2021. And, of course, there's always the aspect of capital market in that business that impacts AUM itself, but also the revenue. And then within the offering, Meyer, there's different types. So we have pension assets and we have non-pension assets, and there's a \u2013 the client really decide on the asset mix, so the exposure to whether equity or bonds or private markets. We think that actually the way that we deploy these assets, there's just mitigation or risk in itself because of the diversification of the portfolio. So I would say that the revenue flows depends on when the AUM funds in the year, but it's been a success and growth story so far.\nDan Glaser: Thanks, Martine. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up a bit on the underlying expenses and just how to think about it. So, Dan, you mentioned earlier, it was a bit above what you had expected in 4Q or at least what you had expected in the third quarter. I guess how should we be thinking about it as we look forward into '21? Based on how I calculate, it looks like underlying expenses were up 1% in 2020. Would you still expect it to be in that 2% to 3% range in '21, or is some of the timing impact kind of -- would that maybe bring the underlying expense growth below that range as we look to '21?\nDan Glaser: Well, it's an impossible question to answer without knowing the organic or underlying growth rate for 2021 in each of our businesses, because a fair amount of our expense growth is linkage with variable comp. Our bonus pool increased in 2020. In fact, the overall Marsh & McLennan bonus pool has never been higher than in 2020, because profitability was up considerably. And so what I look forward to next year or 2021 rather, I look at it and say, almost certainly revenue is going to exceed expense growth as it has for the last 13 years. It may not be in every quarter, but certainly that's how we run the business for a year. I think a lot of our expense pop in the fourth quarter was non-run rate. Some of it was, but a lot of it wasn't. And so I look at it pretty simply. For 10 years prior to COVID, we grew underlying revenue between 3% and 5% and we delivered an adjusted EPS CAGR over that decade of close to 12%. So ultimately, that's what we were playing for the idea that as long as we grow underlying revenue, we can run our business and the expense side of our business in a way to develop strong adjusted EPS growth, and that's kind of how I think about 2021.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay, great. That's helpful, Dan. Thanks. And maybe just a quick question or maybe not so quick, but a question for John. Just wondering what your thoughts are on the primary PNC market pricing environment. And I guess how long do you think that this current hardening rate environment will continue? I think there's been some discussion out there that it may start to taper off at the end of the year, and maybe be more in line with loss trend, but just wanted to get your sense in terms of the direction of the market.\nDan Glaser: John, you want to take that.\nJohn Doyle: Sure, David, the market remains very challenging for our clients in the quarter. Dan talked about the overall price increase at 22% versus 20% in the third quarter. 2020 was obviously a really difficult year for insurers; cat losses, COVID losses, social inflation, low interest rates. So, it certainly accelerated -- COVID certainly accelerated the trend for rising prices throughout 2020. U.S., UK and Australia are the most difficult markets generally speaking for our clients. Looking forward, I'm most concerned, again, from our clients\u2019 perspective, about D&O pricing and excess liability pricing, the excess liability market primarily here in the U.S. Just a lot of ongoing discussion about growing claim frequency, growing claim severity in part, again, driven by social inflation. But just broad concerns in the underwriting community about rate adequacy there. Work comp remains, pricing remains down on the other hand and it\u2019s been down candidly a bit longer than I\u2019ve been expecting, but good for our clients. We are seeing some lines of business where the rate increase line kind of flattened out or began to moderate. And that's not to say that prices were down, but the average increase in the fourth quarter, like in our property book, for example, wasn't up as much as it was in the third quarter. So again, overall, from my clients\u2019 point of view, I'm most concerned about D&O and excess liability pricing. I do think as time wears on throughout the rest of 2021, other lines of business will likely moderate a bit.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan, for any closing remarks.\nDan Glaser: I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I'd also like to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in 2020, which, of course, was a very challenging year. I want to thank our clients for their continued support. I look forward to speaking to all of you next quarter. Be well.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

Companies are certainly challenged and they've got at least another quarter or more of challenge and uncertainty. But they have a lot to do. They need a lot of support. And I think between Oliver Wyman and Mercer, we have many of the things they need."

            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. 2020 was a year like no other and Marsh & McLennan's response and performance was nothing short of remarkable in these circumstances. The year was characterized by tough choices that we made as a business and as individuals. Our colleagues rose to the occasion and demonstrated resilience, courage, agility, collaboration and empathy in the face of the global pandemic and social unrest. Times like these validate our purpose to make a difference in the moments that matter for our clients, colleagues and communities, and we did exactly that. Our 2020 adjusted EPS growth of 7% is impressive in one of the worst economic recessions ever. Our strong financial performance also enabled us to continue to invest for the future. We continue to develop digital technologies to offer more robust client solutions. We made a number of strategic hires and achieved a record year of acquired revenue with MMA through eight acquisitions, with approximately 235 million of annualized revenue.  Looking forward, while the global pandemic will most likely dominate at least the first half of 2021, there are brighter days ahead. Our proprietary pandemic navigator model predicts that as vaccines are rolled out and we move closer to herd immunity, through natural immunity, infection case counts and vaccinations, the U.S. and UK could see a return to more normal patterns sometime in the back half of the year. As we emerge from the crisis, clients around the world can rely on our expertise, with the three areas that are critical for every organization, risk, strategy and people. The World Economic Forum's Annual Global Risks Report which was released last week and prepared with the support of Marsh & McLennan and other partners highlight some of the most likely and impactful risks facing the world today, and we are working with clients to navigate these issues. Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to go to the Q&A. Yes, it's a good question, Elyse. We were 3% to 5% growth on an underlying basis for 10 straight years before 2020. And so we feel that it's actually really positive that we're believing we will return to that 3% to 5% growth in 2021. The difference between RIS and consulting has more to do with what's happening in the global economy and macro factors, business confidence. Obviously, as demonstrated this year, the RIS business is a bit more resilient with higher levels of recurring revenues in the consulting business. But we're still hopeful actually that we will grow our consulting business in 2021 in both Mercer and Oliver Wyman, and that's actually our plan. We do expect that there would be more strength from the second quarter onwards, because the first quarter, you're basically comparing a pre-COVID world with a COVID world. And so there will be some challenges within that. But we've got some pretty decent momentum that we built throughout the year. And so we're expecting a good year in 2021. As we mentioned in the script, we expect that margin expansion for the year and we also expect solid adjusted EPS growth. Our margin improvement in 2021 will in part be a function of where organic growth is. When we look at it, you say we did a pretty good job of the second quarter. My God, we rattled back expenses fast. Expense growth was down 5% in the second quarter, 4% in the third quarter. So I think it was a remarkable job. Not impacting the business itself, continuing to invest in the business, but managing our expenses aggressively and setting a very high bar for what was required in the midst of a real crisis, a real global crisis. And so the fourth quarter represents to us of getting back not quite to normal, but looking at pacing the way we normally would do. A little inside baseball in that we -- clearly we did a number of strategic hiring in the fourth quarter. We're actually up 500 or actually close to 500 headcount in the fourth quarter. And so we're positioned well for 2021. I'm not worried about quarter-by-quarter comparisons looking at 2021 versus 2020, because 2020 in a lot of ways is such a unique, bizarre type of year. So we're going to run our business the way we run our business as we usually do, where revenue growth exceeds expense growth in almost every quarter, and certainly in every year as it has done for the last 13 years. So, I know that the entire firm was very interested in doing our best to turn the page on 2020 and focus on 2021. And in the fourth quarter, we started really focusing on what that would mean. So I think we're positioned to grow decently in both. Whether our margin goes up in both segments or not, I'm not going to really talk about right now. Our expectation is that we will grow margins. Now, are we going to grow margins to the extent that we did as an overall company in 2020? Well, that would be a very tall ask, bearing in mind all the expenses that were pulled back in the second and third quarter. It's a complicated question, but I think the answer is both. I do think we will return to a more normal pattern to where we look at revenue growth in the 3% to 5% area. Our expense growth for a number of years, four out of the last five years before 2020, was average \u2013 was not average. It was actually 2% growth. So our expense growth normally would be around 2% as it's been. Now some years it might be 3%, some years it might be 1%, but ultimately I think that's the more normal pattern. We do see the opportunity of certain things that we've learned during this year, during the year 2020 to continue. Clearly, when you think about things like where a business is filled with knowledge workers and subject matter experts, so remote working is manageable for us. So our choice of returning to offices is just that. It's a choice. We think it's better for the business. We expect our offices, physical offices to remain really the hub of activity in Marsh & McLennan. But having said that, we also think that over a period of a few years that we would be able to reduce our footprint a bit, and that would actually benefit shareholders but it would also benefit colleagues by making their life a bit more flexible and a bit easier. So certainly, that's an area of having a more actual real estate footprint is an example. We also operated much faster and more connected during COVID than we did previously. And there's an efficiency gain with that that we absolutely want to keep. I don't think T&E. I think it's going to be a while before travel snaps back to the levels that we had in like 2019. And maybe it will be quite a while. I do expect people, once this COVID clears and the crisis is over, to return to travel to see markets and to see clients, but maybe we won't travel quite as much in the past like we used to, and maybe we won't jump on an airplane at a moment's notice. It could be more like, well, let's talk on Zoom, because everybody's used to that now. So I do think that there is lasting efficiency gain which will benefit shareholders in the post COVID world. Sure. I'll lead that off and then I'll hand off to Martine and Scott who can give you a little bit more detail. Our consulting businesses, yes, they have less recurring revenue and parts of the career business and Oliver Wyman are project based. But having said that, they're resilient businesses and there's still plenty of activity as demonstrated versus performance through the year, which was minus 3, but much stronger, minus 3 the last three quarters and actually minus 1 for the year, which actually is much stronger than during the financial crisis. And areas like health and investments, retirement security are lasting and have resilience in and of themselves. Oliver Wyman's pop in the fourth quarter was a bit unexpected for us and it gave us -- usually as I've mentioned before, they tend to be a bit of a canary in the coal mine as the business confidence and thoughts. And so let me go to Martine first and then Scott who can give you a little bit more flavor for how they see growth in their business in 2020. Martine? Thank you, Martine. Scott, let's talk a little bit about how you see 2021. Thanks, Scott. Next question please. It's a good question, Phil. And it's a good catch. My expectation on the call for our third quarter was that expenses would kick in the fourth quarter, but they would still be negative on a year-over-year basis. And actually they're positive on a year-over-year basis. Our expenses grew 1.5% or 2% in the fourth quarter. So it was a bit of a surprise. There's two factors underneath that. One, we didn't expect Oliver Wyman to grow in the fourth quarter and Oliver Wyman grew. And as I've mentioned before, they have the most variable compensation model. And so when they're growing, that's when we build in more on terms of variable comp. So that was something that we did. And the hiring that we did in the fourth quarter on the strategic recruitment side was higher than what we expected. We see a lot of opportunities out there. And as I mentioned, we're up nearly 500 headcount on a net basis in the fourth quarter. So that was a little bit more. So those are the two factors that contributed to us having expenses. It's important to point out, neither of those factors in and of themselves are one way. Certainly with the strategic improvement, we expect revenue over time as a result of building out our headcount as we've done for many years in a row. And the variable comp increase in OW to me is a good news story, because it's attached to growth. And so I would love for that to continue, because it would signify that we're growing the top line in Oliver Wyman. Yes, it's a good question. And I'll start it off and then I'll hand over to John who's got the biggest international footprint and also to Peter so he can weigh in as to what he's seeing in different parts of the world and expectation levels. Let's bear in mind, just to start, our top six countries represent about 75% to 77% of our revenue. So you look at the United States, UK, Canada, Australia, France and Germany, that's a big part of our company. And so it's pretty developed economies stuff. But we always have some level of variability, as you mentioned, and there's going to be different rollouts and there's going to be different timing as to when the individual countries return to normal. But, John, how do you see regional growth patterns as you go forward into 2021? Thanks, John. Peter, you want to give us Guy Carpenter's perspective of regional growth patterns? Thank you. Next question please. Sure. Thanks, Jimmy. So Mark mentioned that we will deploy approximately 3.5 billion of capital in 2021. And Mark, you want to take that question and give a little bit of our philosophy how we're thinking about that? Next question please. Yes. At the end, I don't have the precise number for you. My view in it would be RIS weighted. But consulting, we intend -- if I look at our overall headcount for the total company in 2020, it is up slightly versus 2019. So it's not that we've emptied the cupboard and then we've achieved our margin expansion in 2020 in a way that's going to impact us negatively into the future. We are well prepared for a rebound. And certainly RIS had a very strong year and is the market leader. And so we are the employer of choice in the industry and we have a lot of opportunities to build our headcount with really quality subject matter experts and producing people as we go forward. Sure. It's not a direct read-through. Obviously, with AUM growing, we earn more revenue generally from that. It also creates a bit more volatility to us as we go forward. But it's very much a good news story. I think the CAGR on AUM mid 20s over the last five years or so. So, Martine, how should Meyer and others think about AUM when it comes down to what does it mean for Mercer's business? Thanks, Martine. Next question please. Well, it's an impossible question to answer without knowing the organic or underlying growth rate for 2021 in each of our businesses, because a fair amount of our expense growth is linkage with variable comp. Our bonus pool increased in 2020. In fact, the overall Marsh & McLennan bonus pool has never been higher than in 2020, because profitability was up considerably. And so what I look forward to next year or 2021 rather, I look at it and say, almost certainly revenue is going to exceed expense growth as it has for the last 13 years. It may not be in every quarter, but certainly that's how we run the business for a year. I think a lot of our expense pop in the fourth quarter was non-run rate. Some of it was, but a lot of it wasn't. And so I look at it pretty simply. For 10 years prior to COVID, we grew underlying revenue between 3% and 5% and we delivered an adjusted EPS CAGR over that decade of close to 12%. So ultimately, that's what we were playing for the idea that as long as we grow underlying revenue, we can run our business and the expense side of our business in a way to develop strong adjusted EPS growth, and that's kind of how I think about 2021. John, you want to take that. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I'd also like to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in 2020, which, of course, was a very challenging year. I want to thank our clients for their continued support. I look forward to speaking to all of you next quarter. Be well."

            "name": "John Doyle",
            "content": "Sure, and thank you for the question. Look, we expect a better growth trajectory in the international business in 2021. Of course, the economic outlook matters. And many parts of the world struggled more from an economic perspective as a byproduct, of course, of the pandemic saw maybe less government intervention to support the economies. What I would say, too, internationally, at least in many markets, maybe not the UK, maybe not Australia, or some other more developed markets, a lot of premium spend can be quite discretionary. And so you have liability environments that are very, very different than the countries that I mentioned earlier. And we also saw less price and less rate increase in many of those markets as well. So I think overall, I would expect less premium growth from an insurer perspective internationally than what we saw in the U.S. where as you saw, we had very, very strong revenue growth this year. But again, I'm optimistic about '21. It should be a better year. Sure, David, the market remains very challenging for our clients in the quarter. Dan talked about the overall price increase at 22% versus 20% in the third quarter. 2020 was obviously a really difficult year for insurers; cat losses, COVID losses, social inflation, low interest rates. So, it certainly accelerated -- COVID certainly accelerated the trend for rising prices throughout 2020. U.S., UK and Australia are the most difficult markets generally speaking for our clients. Looking forward, I'm most concerned, again, from our clients' perspective, about D&O pricing and excess liability pricing, the excess liability market primarily here in the U.S. Just a lot of ongoing discussion about growing claim frequency, growing claim severity in part, again, driven by social inflation. But just broad concerns in the underwriting community about rate adequacy there. Work comp remains, pricing remains down on the other hand and it's been down candidly a bit longer than I've been expecting, but good for our clients. We are seeing some lines of business where the rate increase line kind of flattened out or began to moderate. And that's not to say that prices were down, but the average increase in the fourth quarter, like in our property book, for example, wasn't up as much as it was in the third quarter. So again, overall, from my clients' point of view, I'm most concerned about D&O and excess liability pricing. I do think as time wears on throughout the rest of 2021, other lines of business will likely moderate a bit."

And it's fascinating because we have not seen any weakness in the underlying subject premium basis from our clients. And quite frankly, uncertainty creates demand in the reinsurance business. The uncertainty created by COVID and the potential loss magnitude has increased demand in all of our businesses. But for the first time in a long time, our international businesses have all grown by strong double digits. And we see the same thing for 2021."

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning. We're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results, which was strong despite the challenges of 2020. We grew our top line, delivered solid earnings growth and entered 2021 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. Consolidated revenue increased 4% in the fourth quarter to 4.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 1%. Operating income was 571 million, while adjusted operating income was 855 million. Our adjusted operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 21.3%. GAAP EPS was $0.73 and adjusted EPS was $1.19. Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue grew 6% to 2.5 billion and was up 3% on an underlying basis, or 4%, excluding the impact of a decline in fiduciary interest. We are pleased with this excellent finish to the year, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business in the face of the pandemic. Adjusted operating income decreased 5% to 525 million and the adjusted margin contracted 220 basis points to 23.5%, reflecting the expected increase in expense in the fourth quarter.  For the year, revenue was 10.3 billion, an increase of 8% with solid underlying growth of 3%. Adjusted operating income growth for the year was impressive at 14%, and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 170 basis points to 28%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter rose 7% to 2.4 billion increasing 4% on an underlying basis. In the U.S. and Canada division, underlying growth was 7% for the quarter and 5% for the full year, driven by strength across the portfolio. 2020 represents the third straight year of 5% or higher underlying growth in U.S. and Canada. In the international division, underlying revenue was flat in the quarter with Latin America up 3%, Asia Pacific up 1% and EMEA down 2%. For the full year, revenue at Marsh was 8.6 billion, an increase of 7% or 3% on an underlying basis. Sure. Jimmy, your math is good. The 3.5 billion; your 1 billion for dividends, 0.5 billion in debt paydown and your remainder of 2 billion. As I said earlier and as we've said consistently, we favor acquisitions. And so as we think about that, that $2 billion bucket, the lean is going to be M&A. Our M&A pipeline is good. But I would say we do expect a meaningful amount of share repurchases. Just the exact amount is really going to depend on the strength of the M&A pipeline as we go through the year. Yes. Jimmy, we're the market leader. We don't compete an awful lot for assets in the marketplace in any kind of competitive bidding processes. At the end, the majority of companies that we acquire were in exclusive negotiations. And their decision oftentimes is, are they going to come with Marsh & McLennan or will they remain private. That is how it works on the majority of ours. So we're not chasing deals. And frankly, if a company is debating whether they should sell to us as a combination that would help them grow better and give better career path into their colleague base and they're viewing that as to what about private equity as an example, as an alternative, then they were not ready for really that conversation. At the end, we like doing transactions in which we're not selling ourselves and they're not selling themselves. We're deciding in combination that working together will enable more flow for the combined operation on a go-forward basis. So we're highly selected. We're not doing dozens and dozens of deals, as you see that takes place out there in the market. And as I said, most of our acquisitions were in some element of exclusive discussion."

            "name": "Martine Ferland",
            "content": "Yes. Well, thanks, Ben and Mike for the question. Actually we're pleased, as Dan said, about the new business activities that we've seen in the current challenging circumstances. And we look at what the world needs right now in terms of redefining the world of work, addressing health challenges. And also we've seen quite a lot of demand in the investment solutions side of our portfolio. We've closed the year at a record level of assets under management at $357 billion. So I'd say health has been resilient through the crisis. We grew 2%. And we see a bright spot there in terms of digital solutions demand for virtual care, mental health, for example, or workforce communication. As I said, wealth, of course, we have the structural decline in the defined benefit, but that has slowed down a bit during 2020. And we've seen a lot of project work related to market volatility. So that could continue. But definitely our investment solutions are very much in demand. And then for us, career is our most discretionary project work business, in particular on the service side of career. But career usually rebound with the economy. And as Dan said in his remarks, we expect the economy recovery to come back at least in part of H2 and therefore -- and we are seeing some strength in the career pipeline. We've seen that in Q4. So all-in-all, I think our services are very relevant for the times. We're watching, of course, the agenda from the Biden administration. But we think that we are well positioned there. In particular, we are very strong in ESG, like diversity and inclusion consulting and also on responsible investment, and helping clients address the transition to a low carbon economy. So I think as soon as the economy comes back, I think we should see a good rebound. Yes. Well, it's definitely a very strong suit for us, and also the demand through the COVID crisis has increased. We've seen the same on the global financial crisis. When the market becomes more uncertain, the demand for improved governance and transaction agility really drive demand for us, and we're seeing this. So we had very, very strong inflows in 2020. We're seeing a very good pipeline for 2021. And, of course, there's always the aspect of capital market in that business that impacts AUM itself, but also the revenue. And then within the offering, Meyer, there's different types. So we have pension assets and we have non-pension assets, and there's a \u2013 the client really decide on the asset mix, so the exposure to whether equity or bonds or private markets. We think that actually the way that we deploy these assets, there's just mitigation or risk in itself because of the diversification of the portfolio. So I would say that the revenue flows depends on when the AUM funds in the year, but it's been a success and growth story so far."

Third quarter 2020 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company\u2019s website at www.mmc.com.

Please refer to the schedule in today\u2019s earnings release. I\u2019ll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.\nDan Glaser: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. We are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results, which demonstrate the continued strong execution and resilience of Marsh & McLennan in these challenging times. The economic impact of the pandemic continues to unfold. Governments swiftly provided necessary stimulus earlier this year and societies adapting as healthcare professionals continue to drive better health outcomes. Nevertheless, the consequences are likely to be with us for some time. This is not a sprint or even a 10-K. It is a marathon. Oliver Wyman\u2019s pandemic navigator model and experts currently predict that even in the more optimistic scenarios, where a vaccine or therapeutics are developed and available, we are still unlikely to return to more normal conditions before the end of 2021. At Marsh & McLennan, we are prepared for the long-haul. The company has been resilient amidst the challenges of 2020. We are experiencing one of the worst recessions in history and our performance to-date is nothing short of outstanding in the circumstances. Times like these validate our purpose to make a difference in moments that matter. We\u2019ve done just that by helping clients with issues of the day, including healthcare solutions, risk management, cyber, climate, enhanced resilience, digital transformation, diversity strategies among others. Our focus on risk, strategy and people is more critical than ever and our colleagues have demonstrated incredible dedication and agility. Supporting our colleagues is always a major priority and is even more critical during the pandemic. Just last week, we received the results of our most recent calling engagement survey. Our support has been validated by the results, which showed record engagement scores. Looking at our execution during this period, it\u2019s been impressive. At Marsh, our year-to-date underlying growth is 3%. Guy Carpenter is having a strong year with 6% underlying growth for the first nine months. Consulting has experienced more of an adverse impact. We are pleased the effects are not as severe as we saw during the financial crisis. The expense discipline across the firm has allowed us to achieve strong margin expansion and 9% adjusted EPS growth year-to-date. Our solid earnings growth coupled with a firm-wide focused on working capital is driving significant free cash flow enabling us to increase our dividend complete acquisitions and remain largely on track with our de-leveraging plans. We achieved all this while at the same time, continuing to position the company for the long-term. We are pursuing strategic hires and seeing opportunity to benefit from industry consolidation. We continue to build out MMA through acquisition with 2020 seeing the most revenue acquired and capital deployed since we launched the business in 2009, and the pipeline is solid. In addition opportunities to benefit from new areas of growth, increase our penetration of existing markets, as well as achieve higher levels of efficiency. with the heavy lifting from the JLT integration, well behind us, we are connected, unified and focused on growth in all dimensions. We are executing well and I see opportunity to emerge from this period even stronger. The crisis proved that our workforce is agile and there was opportunity over the long-term to operate with greater flexibility, increase the use of technology, reduce travel, and shrink our real estate footprint. This will not only drive savings for shareholders, but increase colleague satisfaction and enhance our ability to bring the best of Marsh & McLennan to every client situation. In some ways, the crisis acted as a natural accelerant for collaboration and cross business activity. We are increasingly bringing together our businesses to help clients. For example, COVID-19 increased the cyber risk profile of nearly every firm and our businesses are working hand in hand to deliver holistic cyber advisory and insurance solutions to aid in mitigation, response and remediation. We are also bringing the businesses together to help clients address the climate risk. Marsh\u2019s consulting, Oliver Wyman and Guy Carpenter came together recently held a major international bank, analyze and create a mitigation strategy on climate risk. Mercer, Oliver Wyman and Marsh\u2019s consulting continue to come together to assist clients with return to office initiatives in the face of the global pandemic. By leveraging their combined data, we are providing clients with operational support, predictive models for reopening, financial planning, communication strategies, and overall benefit reviews. Underpinning these initiatives is the proprietary data and analytics from Oliver Wyman\u2019s pandemic navigator model, which was recently recognized as one of the most accurate predictive models of COVID-19 cases and fatalities, and it\u2019s utilized by the CVC. These are just some of the examples of the collaboration and innovation that support our continued growth potential. Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. The third quarter marks the 12th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index increased 20% year-over-year versus 19% in the second quarter and 14% in the first quarter. Global property insurance was up 21%, and global financial and professional lines were up 40% while global casualty rates are up 6% on average and workers\u2019 compensation pricing remain negative in the period. Keep in mind, our index used to large account business. However U.S. small and middle market insurance pricing continues to accelerate as well. Although the magnitude of price increases is less than for large complex accounts. Pricing continues to react to multiple external headwinds impacting insurer profitability and this is only exacerbated by COVID-19 losses, which continued to evolve. COVID-19 will be a law in complicated loss and the interpretation of various policyholder wordings will be determined in the courts over time. In reinsurance, price increases evidenced at the 4/1 Japan renewals and 6/1 Florida renewals continued into the 10/1 renewals. These were larger increases than at January 1, but primarily driven by loss impacted business. Guy Carpenter\u2019s U.S. rate online index was up 12% year-over-year in July reflecting reduced alternative capital inflows, constrained retrocessional capacity and traditional reinsurers exercising caution regarding the amount of capital they are willing to expose in the face of wind, wildfire and developing COVID-19 losses. We are currently near the tail end of one of the most active hurricane seasons in U.S. history with a record level of named storms, making landfall while numerous aggregate losses were thankfully not as severe as they could have been. The P&C insurance and reinsurance markets overall are showing a heightened degree of scrutiny and risk selection with continue push for higher pricing. As the advocates for the client, we remain steadfast in our goal to deliver the highest quality coverage at the best possible terms. And these challenging market conditions highlight the value of the advice and services that Marsh & McLennan delivers. Now, let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We delivered adjusted EPS growth of 6%, despite the global impact of COVID-19. Our EPS growth in the quarter reflects great execution on the part of our colleagues and continued expense discipline. Total revenue was unchanged versus a year ago at $4 billion and down 1% on an underlying basis. Underlying revenue grew 2% in RIS and declined 4% in consulting. In Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, an increase of 4%. Underlying revenue growth was up 2% in the quarter, reflecting solid growth of 3% in Marsh and flat at Guy Carpenter, which overcame a previously disclosed $17 million one-time benefit in the year-ago period. RIS adjusted operating income increased 24% to $388 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 280 basis points versus a year ago. In Consulting, third quarter revenue was $1.7 billion. Underlying revenue declined by 4% for the quarter. Oliver Wyman immerses career business continue to feel the greatest impact from recessionary conditions. Consulting adjusted operating income declined by 5% and the adjusted margin expanded 20 basis points versus a year ago. Overall, adjusted operating income increased 9% versus a year ago to $638 million. Our adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 18.4% adjusted earnings per share increased 6% versus a year ago to $0.82 per share. Even though the impact with COVID-19 may be far from over, our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance is evidence that we are executing well in this challenging environment. Given our excellent third quarter performance, our full-year outlook has improved. for the full-year 2020, we now expect underlying revenue to be roughly flat with growth in RIS offset by a decline in Consulting. In addition, we expect to generate mid single-digit growth in adjusted EPS for the full year. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, Dan and good morning. We\u2019re pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results, which demonstrate the resilience of our business as well as how well we are executing through the crisis. Despite a modest decline and underlying revenue in the quarter, we generated solid earnings growth, strong free cash flows and margin expansion in both segments. Overall revenue was flat in the third quarter and declined 1% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter was $540 million, an increase of 15% over last year. adjusted operating income increased 9% to $638 million and our adjusted margin increased 150 basis points to 18.4%. GAAP EPS increased to $0.62 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 6% to $0.82. for the first nine months of 2020, total revenue growth was 3% with underlying growth of 1%. Our adjusted operating income grew 12%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 180 basis points to 23.8% and our adjusted EPS increased 9% to $3.77. in Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue grew 4% to $2.3 billion with underlying growth of 2%. A decline in fiduciary interest income driven by lower interest rates served as 100 basis point drag on underlying growth in the third quarter and 60 basis point drag for the nine months. operating income increased 52% to $333 million. adjusted operating income increased 24% to $388 million and the adjusted margin increased 280 basis points to 20.2%. for the first nine months of the year, RIS revenue was $7.8 billion, representing growth of 8% and underlying growth of 3%. adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year was up 20% to $2.1 billion. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2 billion with underlying growth of 3% representing another solid quarter of growth considering the macroeconomic headwinds. U.S. and Canada grew 5% on an underlying basis in the quarter, led by strong growth in MMA. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter. The U.S. and Canada has delivered 3% or higher underlying growth. In international underlying growth was 2% with Asia Pacific up 4%, Latin America up 2% and EMEA flat. For the first nine months, revenue at Marsh was $6.2 billion with underlying growth of 3%. U.s. and Canada was up 4% while international was up 2%. Guy Carpenter continues to have a great year. Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenue was $274 million in the quarter, which was flat on both the reported and underlying basis. As we disclosed previously, Guy Carpenter\u2019s growth in the third quarter of last year benefited from the true-up of a multi-year contract. Excluding this item, underlying growth was 6% in the quarter and reflects continued solid results across the portfolio. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter\u2019s revenue was $1.5 billion, 6% underlying growth. In Consulting, third quarter revenue was $1.7 billion. underlying revenue was down 4% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of the current crisis. adjusted operating income decreased 5% to $306 million while the adjusted margin increased 20 basis points to 18.9%. For the first nine months of the year, Consulting\u2019s revenue was $5.1 billion, down 2% on an underlying basis and adjusted operating income declined 6% to $860 million. Mercer\u2019s revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, down 3% on an underlying basis. Wealth underlying revenue decreased 3% led by a decline in DB. within wealth however, we continue to see growth in the outsourced CIO business and at the end of the quarter, our assets under management were approximately $321 billion. This 5% sequential increase was driven by strong new funding and marketing. health underlying growth is flat in the quarter and career underlying revenue was down 11%. Careers, where we have more discretionary projects business, which is seeing the most impact from the crisis. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $3.6 billion, down 1% on an underlying basis. Oliver Wyman\u2019s revenue was $480 million in the quarter, a decline of 6% on an underlying basis. This marks an improvement from the pace of decline in the second quarter, and reflects stronger sales and continued solid delivery of projects. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.5 billion, a decline of 6% on an underlying basis. Turning to corporate. Adjusted corporate expense was $56 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately $58 million in the fourth quarter. We had $2 million of investment income on an adjusted basis in the quarter and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income for the balance of 2020 will be immaterial. On a GAAP basis, investment income was a loss of $14 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting a change in the market value of our remaining investment in Alexander Forbes. foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind to adjusted EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a slight benefit in the fourth quarter. our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.5% compared with 25% in the third quarter last year. excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5%. Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.6%, compared with 24.3% last year, and we expect the full-year rate to be between 25% and 26% due in part to an expected impact from discrete items in the fourth quarter. Turning to the JLT integration, I\u2019m happy to report that the bulk of integration activity is largely behind this, and we have achieved the vast majority of the targeted savings, which is well ahead of schedule. We incurred $44 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the third quarter, bringing the total to-date to $516 million. The remaining work to be done consists primarily of ongoing technology application migrations and the further consolidation of real estate, which will continue through 2021. I want to take a minute and provide an update to our outlook for 2020. our 2020 outlook assumes recessionary conditions persist for the rest of the year. Despite this headwind, we expect RIS to generate underlying revenue growth for the full year offset by a decline in Consulting. at Marsh, we see underlying growth in the low single digits for Q4 and the full year, a solid result in the face of the pandemic. at Guy carpenter, we continue to expect mid single-digit underlying growth for the full year. Guy Carpenter\u2019s fourth quarter could be impacted by difficult comparisons to last year although Q4 is a seasonally small quarter. We continue to expect Mercer\u2019s underlying revenue will decline in the fourth quarter and be down modestly for the full year. Finally, revenue weakness in Oliver Wyman will persist through the fourth quarter. As we learn to live with the virus, we are progressively moving to a more normal course for business decisions. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings will be impacted by a sequential uptick in expenses due to a general loosening of spending restrictions, strategic hiring, and costs associated with employee related activity that would have taken place over the course of the year, but was delayed due to the pandemic. Despite this, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook for the year to mid single-digit growth. In addition, based on this outlook, we expect our overall margin will increase, which would Mark our 13th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash, saw a sequential reduction in outstanding debt and have the entirety of our combined $2.8 billion of credit facilities available. We remain committed to deleveraging and we continue to expect to reduce overall debt this year. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $12.7 billion, down from $13.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting the repayment of a $500 million one-year term loan ahead of its schedule maturity. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in December when 700 million of senior notes mature. Interest expense in the third quarter was $128 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $127 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter. While uncertainty remains high in the current environment, we feel the actions we have taken to secure additional flexibility along with our strong performance to-date positions us well to continue to navigate the crisis from a liquidity perspective. In line with our prior commentary, we did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter and do not plan to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2020. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $295 million and included $59 million for acquisitions, and $236 million for dividends. for the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $1.5 billion and included $753 million for acquisitions and $702 million for dividends. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. We are on track to deliver a solid year, despite the ongoing global pandemic. our results reflect the strength and resilience of our company and our colleagues, and we remain focused on striking the right balance between delivering solid results today while continuing to invest for growth in the future. And with that, I\u2019m happy to turn it back to Dan.\nDan Glaser: Thank you, Mark. and operator, we\u2019re ready to go to the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Thanks. Good morning. I guess I\u2019d love to hear more about parts of the consulting segment. That seems to be the area with a higher level of organic growth uncertainty, where we\u2019re getting most of our questions incoming from investors. You\u2019ll clearly improve margins there in the segment despite negative organic growth. Maybe, you can talk about some things that drove that the sustainability; is there more or less uncertainty in that segment going forward, given the pandemic seems to be causing some shutdowns again in Europe, so a broad question.\nDan Glaser: Yes. Sure, Mike. I\u2019d start by saying; we\u2019re we lucky to have a variety of businesses within Marsh & McLennan. With many consulting, as an example, we\u2019d have businesses which have high degrees of recurring revenues, such as our health business and our investment business parts of our retirement actuarial business as an example. we have other parts of our consulting business like Marsh\u2019s career business and Oliver Wyman, which are more project based. And then project-based work has an awful lot to do with general economic conditions and business confidence. So, it is a natural outcome for us to feel pressure on those businesses in times of recession or in times where there\u2019s a high level of uncertainty, but we can navigate it as a total company and we understand that businesses. they are terrific businesses, market-leading fantastic businesses, and they make the overall company smarter as well. So, from our perspective, it\u2019s the grouping together that matters the most and certainly, businesses that have less recurring revenue and more project work are under more pressure on times like these and that will continue, so that is \u2013 we felt it during the financial crisis and we\u2019ll feel it now. Now, the bounce back can be very swift, because as soon as the turn happens and companies get back into business as usual, return to growth type of mode. Then that work picks up. I\u2019m happy to say that both of those businesses are holding up better than during the financial crisis. because in the beginning of this crisis, we weren\u2019t sure whether that would be the case or not and it has turned out that those businesses have proved to be more resilient than they were during the financial crisis. Anything else, Mike?\nMike Zaremski: Yes. I\u2019ll switch gears to property and casualty insurance, rate increase momentum has accelerated. And I think a lot of your clients are seeing double-digit rate increases year-on-year now. for some of the carriers that doesn\u2019t seem to be translating into as much top-line growth as we expected, even taking into account weak exposures. I mean, are you guys seeing more of your clients self-insure and just kind of \u2013 are you guys having to do more work there is that impacting your Marsh & McLennan at all? It feels like there\u2019s \u2013 the market\u2019s just so tough and challenging in certain places that corporates are \u2013 you\u2019re having to help corporates to offset some of the pain per se.\nDan Glaser: Yes. It\u2019s a great question and I\u2019ll hand off to John in a second to address this, because it\u2019s really Marsh question more than a Guy Carpenter one. The Marsh is tough and we\u2019re on the side of the client, and we\u2019re advocating for the client doing the best we can in the circumstances, in some ways, some level of the increases in certain parts of the business, are probably justified based upon loss levels and a soft market environment that has persisted for years. Although we don\u2019t like the speed of the increases, ultimately, I don\u2019t think that benefits the market or benefits our clients, when it snaps back in such a \u2013 in times harsh way. particularly, in this kind of environment, where clients, in certain industries, are really feeling a lot of pressure on revenue and survival, and then being hit with large levels of insurance increases, it\u2019s a real tough environment and we\u2019re doing our best for our clients in the circumstances. And John, do you want to add to that?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Dan. Mike, I think obviously, every transaction\u2019s got the mix of different factors that drive the outcome for our clients. That\u2019s a very, very challenging market for them, especially given the atomic environment. So, we have putting aside the price and exposure aspect of what drives the ultimate premium that gets charged to the client. Some clients are being forced to retain more risk; it\u2019s fewer, but whether it\u2019s through higher retentions or in very, very few circumstances, where we can\u2019t get the limit that we would like, or that our client would like, but with some level of frequency, clients are electing to retain more risks. So, it could be a higher retention. It could be bindless limit in certain cases, for example, in the D&O market, where there is a meaningful amount of stress in the U.S., UK and Australia, in particular, some clients are electing to buy A side only coverage; or where they do buy some B and C cover, they take down the limits, where they do by B and C. And so we obviously work with our clients very, very closely and are working hard to present their risks as best we can to drive the best possible outcome. And the other dynamic I would mention as well is we are seeing an increase in the number of captive formations as well. So, a lot of different strategies, obviously helping our clients navigate the market as best we can.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you. Nice quarter.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I guess starting on the revenue outlook within RIS and maybe, I\u2019m zoning in, on Marsh strong results there, I guess, given on the backdrop that you alluded to Dan, in your opening remarks, how do we think about like, do you think the Q2 and the Q3 for that business specifically, I\u2019m talking to Marsh represented the kind of the trough of the slowdown from COVID. I know there\u2019s a lot of obviously uncertainty out there, but when we think about the fourth quarter and into 2021, I know you said that these conditions can persist into the end of 2021, but how should we think about that business specifically? It seems like it\u2019s been pretty resilient and could the Q2 and Q3 be the trough and could we start thinking about things getting better just based off of what you know today?\nDan Glaser: Yes. Okay. So, it\u2019s a terrific question. And I\u2019ll start with it. and then I\u2019ll hand off to John and also Peter, so they can address it in more depth. I\u2019d start by saying we\u2019re thrilled with RIS\u2019s performance and yes, they have proved to be tremendously resilient market leading flight to quality types of attributes and I want to make one point, because fiduciary income is often ignored in the mix here and you just look at RIS\u2019s underlying growth, 3% in the third quarter, rather than 2% and 4% year-to-date if I exclude fiduciary income. the reality is fiduciary income has dropped in half year-to-date, there was $80 million within RIS and now it\u2019s $40 million. So, you look at our performance, not just top-line, but more specifically on the bottom line in overcoming the loss of that fiduciary income and growing through it, it was really an overall terrific performance. Now, getting to your real question is like is the worst over. I have to say it\u2019s really impossible to say. We all want to say it, but it\u2019s impossible to say that it\u2019s only going to get better from here so much depends on COVID and the government response and the economic implications of any government response and so it\u2019s really too early to say that we\u2019re out of the woods. As we mentioned in our remarks, our experts within Oliver Wyman, who advised many governments, et cetera are really thinking that at the earliest, this model returned to what feels like normal, kind of this time next year. And so this is a long haul and we have to be prepared for the long haul. I think that one of the things that we can say, not only as Marsh & McLennan, but also as a society, we are resilient. We are learning. we are adapting and it should get better from here. 2021 should, in a macro basis, get better from here. And as you know, many of the prognosis on 2021 is that recession sometime, second, third quarter of 2021. And so it should be better, but it\u2019s very difficult to call the trough. What I would say is we will grind through and power through any scenario. We will grow our revenue in almost all circumstances faster than we grow our expenses as we\u2019ve done for 12 or 13 years in a row that will continue. But John, why don\u2019t we start with you and then hand over to Peter?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. thanks, Dan. Look, I was pleased with our results. our team is highly focused and I\u2019m very, very proud of them and what are very different circumstances for folks on a personal level, but also in a very, very difficult insurance market. Our U.S. business continues to grow well. Dan mentioned and Mark mentioned that the growth at MMA was very strong. Canada\u2019s performing very well. Our MGA operations at Victor\u2019s, we\u2019re the largest MGA in the world performing quite nicely. internationally, I\u2019m seeing good growth in Asia, in the middle East and Africa as well and a number of different specialties. Some are under pressure, of course, aviation and energy, as you might expect. But FINPRO is growing very well, construction actually, a good quarter for us. We grew nicely in credit lines as well. I mentioned earlier with Mike, some clients are deciding to buy a less insurance, one exception to that is in cyber. So, our cyber business is growing very, very well at the moment and we\u2019re seeing particularly in the U.S. and in the UK, our clients elect to buy more limit there. So, as Dan pointed out, it\u2019s difficult to project where things go, but I\u2019m confident in our ability to perform relatively well. The other point I would make is just we\u2019re as deep and as strong as we\u2019ve ever been from a talent point of view. last year was a big year of change for us bringing JLT and Marsh together. We did a lot of work on our culture and becoming a team, and we weren\u2019t doing it of course, in anticipation of a pandemic, but we really were coming together very, very nicely at a time when our clients need us the most. And so anyway, the teamwork there has been outstanding. Peter?\nDan Glaser: So Peter, I mean, it\u2019s hard to talk about potential trough with you at 6% year-to-date, it is a \u2013 that\u2019s a trough, I'll take it, but any comments Peter?\nPeter Hearn: Yes. As I\u2019ve said before, we built Guy Carpenter to produce consistent results regardless of the market conditions. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that over the past three years, and while Q3 and Q4 tend to be seasonally small and by nature inherently volatile. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our flat result given the fact that we had this one-time, multi-year true up from 2019 plus some negative timing. And on a normalized basis, we would have grown 6%. So, when I look at the year, when I look at the environment that we\u2019re operating in, where there\u2019s still a high degree of fear and uncertainty based on both prior years and the unknown relative to COVID-19. I think Guy Carpenter is well positioned. And then as I look at our new business growth for 2020, we\u2019re on track for our fourth year of record, new business growth. So overall, I feel very good of how \u2013 where Guy Carpenter is positioned in the market.\nDan Glaser: Thanks. Elyse, any follow-ups?\nElyse Greenspan: Yes. thanks. That was very thorough. My next question is on the margin side, really good margin improvement, given the headwinds as well, 150 basis points in the third quarter overall, 180 year-to-date. Obviously, that\u2019s a function of some JLT saves, some COVID-related savings that you guys have alluded to. I\u2019m just trying to extrapolate this. So, 150 in the Q3, you guys have said margin improvement for the year. So that leaves a bit of a range for the \u2013 how the fourth quarter could turn out. just trying to think about the JLT saves, as well as some COVID saves that could persist, like how should we think about kind of the expense profile that there were some one-time items in the third quarter.\nDan Glaser: Yes. it\u2019s another good question. And it\u2019s a fair question, because we\u2019re basically saying we\u2019re at 9% growth of adjusted EPS growth year-to-date and will be mid single digit to the year, but for the year is not in our outlook? So, it sort of says, well, what\u2019s happening in the fourth quarter? So, it\u2019s a fair question. And I would just say, there was some loosening of expense controls in Q3 and we\u2019re going, and that will increase in Q4. We are getting back progressively to a more normal pattern of our business and that will mean that there\u2019ll be more hiring. Hiring is down this year. Our own level of turnover as a company is down relative to the years past. There\u2019ll be some employee related actions as we position ourselves for 2021. And there\u2019s some pent-up demand and some catch-ups that will happen in the fourth quarter, but if you take a step back from this, I just want to say that every company has sort of a natural cadence to both revenue and expense. And as we have demonstrated over many years, we understand that. And so therefore, in every single year, our revenue growth of upward down as we\u2019ve seeded out our expense results. And when I look at our typical level of underlying expense growth, you look at the last five years, four of those five years, then there was 2% expense growth on an annual basis underlying, okay. Including 2% in 2019 and 2% in the first quarter of 2020 claims. So, 2% could be looked at as a natural sort of cadence of expense growth and that\u2019s why we were having really good results over the last couple of years, because we were growing top line at 4% and we were having expense growth at 2% underlying as an overall company. In the second quarter of this year, we went from 2% growth on expense in the first quarter to minus five underlying expense growth in the second quarter. So clearly, we would hold back on discretionary expense and we set a high bar for what was actually necessary and required. in the third quarter, that became the minus four. So that\u2019s going to continue. I\u2019m not going to say whether it\u2019s a minus three, minus two, minus one, it\u2019s probably still going to be a minus, right. So, we are not going to grow expenses in the fourth quarter, year-over-year. But our expense growth will sequentially go up versus the third quarter, which also end up versus the \u2013 where we were in the second quarter. So, that\u2019s sound, the right way to look at it from my perspective.\nElyse Greenspan: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Thanks. Good morning. So Dan, you had talked about in your \u2013 I think it was your prepared remarks, the potential for an uptake and expense actions that were delayed throughout the year and just thinking about all the uncertainties that we have in the world. And I think they\u2019re totally understandable and warranted, but what gives you the confidence or the thought to start bringing back expenses and how do we think about the unfolding of catch-up over the next year or two, as we get to whatever normal is in that timeframe?\nDan Glaser: Yes. well, we all exist in the world, right. So at the end, our performance in part will reflect what\u2019s happening with regard to the virus and what\u2019s happening with regards to the general economic environment. I\u2019m not saying that things with the virus are getting materially better. I do think that health outcomes are materially better than they were in the early stages of the virus, because doctors and healthcare professionals have adapted, they\u2019ve learned. And so oftentimes, the results have been better. Hospitalizations are quite, not quite as severe and fatality globally are generally well down. It\u2019s not the make line-up of any illness. I mean, an illness is an illness, but I think more importantly, the world is learning to live with the virus a bit. And so investment decisions are being made thoughts about next year and the year after are being made. The idea that the sun will rise in the future, that is the thought process within companies. And so our feeling is 2021 on a macro basis should be better. It may not be materially better, but it should be better than 2020. And then the other thing is we have now two quarters to look at where we were in this second of this crisis and look how our businesses performed. Our expectations were exceeded on both top and bottom line. Our consulting business held up it is non-recurring parts of it better than our expectations. Our RIS business, both in Marsh and Guy Carpenter have done phenomenally well in the circumstances. And our year-to-date result is very strong. So, that is our all learning from that and adaptability has given us the confidence to step out a little bit and say, okay, let\u2019s \u2013 we won\u2019t return fully to normal operations. And we\u2019re still largely remote working, but progressively moving towards something that can feel a little bit more like normal. Like as an example we do performance appraisals every year, near the end of the year. We\u2019re going to do that this year. We\u2019ll do the same thing. And yes, maybe even be a little bit more awkward because it\u2019s over Zoom and everything else like that in terms of having discussions. But it\u2019s important for people to know, they\u2019re either on track or off track doing a great job or not. And so we\u2019re going to continue with that, the more \u2013 in more areas than the HR, but really across the piece digital transformation work, where I\u2019m working on further integration activities. We find out this pressing ahead and going forward with some of the things that we delayed in the second and early parts of the third quarter.\nPhil Stefano: Got it. Thank you. And thinking about the out-performance at least based on our expectations for RIS and organic, I was hoping you could just help us think about, the economic benefit versus maybe what we feared a couple of months ago versus potential implications from two of your larger competitors going through a merger and any benefits that that may have?\nDan Glaser: Yes. I mean, in terms of, as I indicated in my initial remarks, our performance this year has been nothing short of outstanding. And that, and I\u2019m saying that as a total company, RIS maybe in particular for total company, I mean, the protection of shareholders in the Consultant segment in a year where they\u2019re challenged on the top line is remarkable and appreciated, and we\u2019re continuing to execute well through Mercer and Oliver Wyman. So, I think as an overall company, like I said, it\u2019s nothing short of outstanding. In terms of our competitors that we\u2019re running our own, right. And we are focused on serving clients like never before they need us now, more than ever before, and supporting our colleagues in, standing up for each other. We wouldn\u2019t trade our strategic positioning with anyone. And we believe that we will benefit from consolidation as clients and industry professionals consider their options in the future. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So, I have a couple of questions along the same lines of the discussion earlier. But any comments on the project pipeline at Mercer and Oliver Wyman? I think you mentioned you expect negative organic growth in 4Q, but based on what you\u2019re seeing have these businesses bottomed already, or it\u2019s hard to say given the uncertainty in the market?\nDan Glaser: That\u2019s impossible to say in the uncertainty. I think we have to bear in mind that Mercer and Oliver Wyman are quite different in terms of their client segment. A part of Mercer and Martine can add more, more details to it. A part of Mercer in the career business is project related work, so in that way, similar to Oliver Wyman, which is almost all project related work. But a good chunk of Mercer has recurring revenue in a similar way to RIS and so it\u2019s not quite as exposed to project work and the vagaries of the economic environment as Oliver Wyman is. So let me, let me hand off the first Martine, and then Scott, to talk a little bit about outlook and project pipeline, but I\u2019ll start by saying we\u2019re not highly uncertain environment. And so therefore, it\u2019s impossible to say anything definitively at this stage in terms of trough or where we go from here, but Martine?\nMartine Ferland: Yes. Thank you, Dan. Absolutely. So, as you said, career as for us is the unit that has the most discretionary project. So, we\u2019ve seen a reduced demand there and some of the regular rewards and consulting work, but at the same time, we were able to help clients with their workforce model, their return to work, their reinvention, the transformation. It\u2019s very exposed to the economic conditions though. So, we\u2019re pleased to see that we had a better Q3, than Q2, but we cannot say whether the outcome what it will be because of course, it\u2019s very related to the conditions out there and as we\u2019re seeing lock downs continuing. If I pivot to health, for example, we\u2019ve had aspects of our health business and has been super resilient. There\u2019s been lots of demand for digital health, such as our Darwin platform solution voluntary benefit support from a health wellness and mental health issues and delights. But there\u2019s a part of our health business, that\u2019s also related to the head counts at our clients. And therefore, depending on the level of lay off that we say, we see some headwinds in that way. Although so far for 2020, it\u2019s not been too severe. And finally on the wealth business, there\u2019s a large part of the wealth business that is regulatory work that is recurring. So it can be resilient. We\u2019ve had a little bit less of project work as the markets calmed down in Q3 versus the first half of the year, but the very bright spot is our OCIO business. So our implemented asset business we\u2019ve seen improved capital market performance in Q3, but also very strong net inflows. And we had a very similar pattern during the global financial crisis where when you see volatility, uncertainty on the market, the client wants strong governance, agility and then transaction of assets, and a slight to quality. So, we\u2019re seeing very strong inflows and very strong pipeline building in that business. So, that\u2019s for Mercer.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. Thank you. Then in the financial crisis, Oliver Wyman decline six quarters in a row, including two quarters at 19%. So, at the end, this has been far more manageable than during the financial crisis, but Scott, you want to talk about your pipeline?\nScott McDonald: Sure, I\u2019ll try and give you some color, Jimmy. As you know, in the second quarter, we had a pretty severe contraction in revenues, not as bad as the financial crisis, but like most times of stress, it was really driven by our clients focusing on just immediate emergency issues as they dealt with the severity of the pandemic. But throughout, I\u2019d say the back end of Q2 and Q3 we\u2019ve shifted our portfolio to services to help clients manage the crisis. Think about the future, a strategic and operational challenges they\u2019ve faced. And it\u2019s been a really fruitful shift for us and recent sales have been very strong. We think, we\u2019re improving our competitive position and we feel pretty good out there with our clients, but we do need the global economy to get back on track. We need business confidence to remain solid. And if that happens, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t get back to our historical growth rates sometime next year.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. Thank you. And just on your reluctance on share buybacks this year. Not that you buy back a lot, but you have bought back some stock each of the last several years. So, what\u2019s the reason \u2013 and the results have actually been better than expected this year. So, what\u2019s the rationale or reasoning behind not buying back? Is it the macro stocks\u2019 valuation like deals? Any insight into that.\nDan Glaser: Sure. Let, me hand over to Mark McGivney. So, Mark?\nMark McGivney: Sure. Hey Jimmy. I actually, the whole cash generation capital management story this year has been a great one for us. Remember back to some of the guidance we gave earlier in the year about capital deployment. We\u2019re largely on track despite the pandemic with those plans. And if you remember coming into the year, the priority for dividend, acquisitions and the big chunk of the leveraging, and as I said, we\u2019re largely on track with all of those. So, we raised our dividend. We\u2019ve got a very active year for M&A, but despite the pandemic, as Dan said earlier, I think it\u2019s actually remarkable as an M&A biggest year in terms of deal value and revenue acquired. So, we\u2019ve been active on the M&A and a front, and we\u2019re still committed to de-leveraging this was going to be a big year of debt paid down. And that\u2019s really what you\u2019re going to see in the fourth quarter. And we may actually see a little bit more M&A activity in the fourth quarter. So coming into the year, we didn\u2019t say share repurchase was going to be that much in the cards and we\u2019re coming in very consistent with the original plans coming into the year.\nDan Glaser: So that would bring us back into the future to our more balanced approach for capital management, where, as we\u2019ve said to you before, dividends are priority dividend, relative to priority, we\u2019ve put acquisitions ahead of share repurchase and we put share repurchase ahead of building cash on the balance sheet. So, 2021 may be a more normal pattern for us where you see more of a balanced approach.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overthinking this, but if you\u2019re expecting full year organic growth to be flat overall, this might imply that the fourth quarter would have to be worse than the third quarter?\nDan Glaser: I mean, I think what we were giving you our outlook on that top line, we\u2019re basically saying, Oliver Wyman will remain under pressure. The Mercer will have the amount of supplies for the year and probably the quarter. So Mercer is continuing in the category of around low single digit negative growth. And that Marsh and Guy Carpenter will grow in the fourth quarter. In total, the Carpenter would feel more pressure, but RIS as a segment would grow. So, I wouldn\u2019t jump to the conclusion that the top line all that different than what we\u2019ve been operating. What we did point to is that our significant levels of expense reduction that we\u2019ve seen in the second quarter. And sequentially a little bit less expense reduction in the third quarter will be less expense reduction in the fourth quarter. And so our expenses will rise at a faster pace than, than what it has in the rest of the year, but we still expect our expense growth in the fourth quarter to be a negative number.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. No, that\u2019s helpful. Understood. One of the things Dan that you mentioned early in the call was strategic hires as an example of recovering expenses. And I was hoping it good talk about that a little bit, if in terms of the context of what, in terms of \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, in terms of whether that will be something big enough for us to notice from our perspective on the outside.\nDan Glaser: It\u2019s not going to be big enough to notice in our expense base. I mean, you look at it, we\u2019ve got nearly 8,000 people around the world, and if you take a normal year, you\u2019re probably looking at about 10% colleague turnover, which means that 8,000 people that are going to be coming into the organization in any given year. So, even if we have significant levels of strategic hiring, strategic recruitment we would absorb it in our regular expense space. So, you\u2019re not going to see a pop and expenses as a result of that. I mean, in an odd quarter, you might, but over the course of a year, it wouldn\u2019t turn up.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess my first question is just trying to connect some of the dots, expenses are down nicely this year. It sounds like you still expect some revenue pressure in 2021. Just, as we\u2019re still dealing with a COVID environment. I would think that would potentially create some expense pressure year-over-year into 2021. And clearly you\u2019ve managed expenses very, very well over the years. So, I guess, how do you deal with that particular year-over-year pressure going on to next year?\nDan Glaser: I mean, all first of all, expense growth is a function of revenue growth. We expect our margins to be up in 2021 for the 14th consecutive year. We expect 2021 to be a decent year relative to 2020, because the general economic environment should be better and there should be better health outcomes as well. So, as I mentioned, were learning to live with the virus more. And from that perspective, time is our friend a little bit. So, I\u2019m optimistic. I think we\u2019re all optimistic about 2021, and performance and we\u2019ll control our expense base, revenue within the overall company. We look at RIS is having large amounts of non-recurring revenue, great strategic positioning. At some point Consulting will come back strong, whether it\u2019s 2021 or not, it\u2019s too early get out. It\u2019s certainly not going to be early in 2021 that we\u2019ve see a massive bounce back because of the overall environment, but we\u2019re optimistic. I mean, I look at this year, we\u2019ve done better on the top line and bottom line than expected gives us a great foundation. We\u2019re working now to position ourselves for a good 2021 and we\u2019re ready to get to it.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. And then my second question is specific to Marsh. If I look sequentially in first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, what are you seeing in terms of overall retention rates and overall new business generation? Are you seeing improvement of the new business, maybe improving retention rates any color you can offer on that would be helpful?\nDan Glaser: Sure. I\u2019ll hand off to John. John, want to dig in there?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Client retention is a very strong, it\u2019s been, been strong throughout the entire year and it\u2019s better than prior year. We had a very strong new business quarter in the first quarter. So, we got off to a very good start to the year, and in the second and third quarter new businesses down slightly year-over-year. But again, given the external environment very, very pleased with the outcome, and it\u2019s not down across the board. So, for example, MMA grew its new business nicely in the third quarter. So, I\u2019m encouraged by how we\u2019re navigating the economic challenges.\nYaron Kinar: And I guess specifically though on sequential changes, because I get that year-over-year, it\u2019s going to be, you\u2019re going to face some pressures, but I\u2019m just curious as how it\u2019s developing sequentially?\nJohn Doyle: I don\u2019t have those numbers in front of me, but there \u2013 our quarters aren\u2019t even throughout the course of the year. So, I do think the year-over-year is an important metric. Clearly, where we\u2019ve seen more stress on the new business front is in a couple of areas, right? It\u2019s \u2013 as you I\u2019m sure would expect construction, infrastructure related things, transaction risk rep and warranty type business where the economic slowdown led to left lesser output and less opportunity for us. But again, I think there\u2019s a flight to quality in the more recurring business. We\u2019ve seen a pickup of late.\nDan Glaser: I also think the way to look at it Yaron is, that new business is relative to other companies, very soft. It\u2019s just not as strong as it was last year, given the overall environment, but still the amount of new business that Marsh is winning is significant. I think that\u2019s our\u2026\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.\nDan Glaser: So thank you for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication as we work through these challenging times. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. I look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

That seems to be the area with a higher level of organic growth uncertainty, where we're getting most of our questions incoming from investors. You'll clearly improve margins there in the segment despite negative organic growth. Maybe, you can talk about some things that drove that the sustainability; is there more or less uncertainty in that segment going forward, given the pandemic seems to be causing some shutdowns again in Europe, so a broad question. Yes. I'll switch gears to property and casualty insurance, rate increase momentum has accelerated. And I think a lot of your clients are seeing double-digit rate increases year-on-year now. for some of the carriers that doesn't seem to be translating into as much top-line growth as we expected, even taking into account weak exposures. I mean, are you guys seeing more of your clients self-insure and just kind of \u2013 are you guys having to do more work there is that impacting your Marsh & McLennan at all?

            "content": "Sure, Dan. Mike, I think obviously, every transaction's got the mix of different factors that drive the outcome for our clients. That's a very, very challenging market for them, especially given the atomic environment. So, we have putting aside the price and exposure aspect of what drives the ultimate premium that gets charged to the client. Some clients are being forced to retain more risk; it's fewer, but whether it's through higher retentions or in very, very few circumstances, where we can't get the limit that we would like, or that our client would like, but with some level of frequency, clients are electing to retain more risks. So, it could be a higher retention. It could be bindless limit in certain cases, for example, in the D&O market, where there is a meaningful amount of stress in the U.S., UK and Australia, in particular, some clients are electing to buy A side only coverage; or where they do buy some B and C cover, they take down the limits, where they do by B and C. And so we obviously work with our clients very, very closely and are working hard to present their risks as best we can to drive the best possible outcome. And the other dynamic I would mention as well is we are seeing an increase in the number of captive formations as well. So, a lot of different strategies, obviously helping our clients navigate the market as best we can. Thank you. Yes. thanks, Dan. Look, I was pleased with our results. our team is highly focused and I'm very, very proud of them and what are very different circumstances for folks on a personal level, but also in a very, very difficult insurance market. Our U.S. business continues to grow well. Dan mentioned and Mark mentioned that the growth at MMA was very strong. Canada's performing very well. Our MGA operations at Victor's, we're the largest MGA in the world performing quite nicely. internationally, I'm seeing good growth in Asia, in the middle East and Africa as well and a number of different specialties. Some are under pressure, of course, aviation and energy, as you might expect. But FINPRO is growing very well, construction actually, a good quarter for us. We grew nicely in credit lines as well. I mentioned earlier with Mike, some clients are deciding to buy a less insurance, one exception to that is in cyber. So, our cyber business is growing very, very well at the moment and we're seeing particularly in the U.S. and in the UK, our clients elect to buy more limit there. So, as Dan pointed out, it's difficult to project where things go, but I'm confident in our ability to perform relatively well. The other point I would make is just we're as deep and as strong as we've ever been from a talent point of view. last year was a big year of change for us bringing JLT and Marsh together. We did a lot of work on our culture and becoming a team, and we weren't doing it of course, in anticipation of a pandemic, but we really were coming together very, very nicely at a time when our clients need us the most. And so anyway, the teamwork there has been outstanding. Peter? Sure. Client retention is a very strong, it's been, been strong throughout the entire year and it's better than prior year. We had a very strong new business quarter in the first quarter. So, we got off to a very good start to the year, and in the second and third quarter new businesses down slightly year-over-year. But again, given the external environment very, very pleased with the outcome, and it's not down across the board. So, for example, MMA grew its new business nicely in the third quarter. So, I'm encouraged by how we're navigating the economic challenges. I don't have those numbers in front of me, but there \u2013 our quarters aren't even throughout the course of the year. So, I do think the year-over-year is an important metric. Clearly, where we've seen more stress on the new business front is in a couple of areas, right?

I couldn't be more pleased with our flat result given the fact that we had this one-time, multi-year true up from 2019 plus some negative timing. And on a normalized basis, we would have grown 6%. So, when I look at the year, when I look at the environment that we're operating in, where there's still a high degree of fear and uncertainty based on both prior years and the unknown relative to COVID-19. I think Guy Carpenter is well positioned. And then as I look at our new business growth for 2020, we're on track for our fourth year of record, new business growth.

            "content": "Thank you, Dan and good morning. We're pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results, which demonstrate the resilience of our business as well as how well we are executing through the crisis. Despite a modest decline and underlying revenue in the quarter, we generated solid earnings growth, strong free cash flows and margin expansion in both segments. Overall revenue was flat in the third quarter and declined 1% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter was $540 million, an increase of 15% over last year. adjusted operating income increased 9% to $638 million and our adjusted margin increased 150 basis points to 18.4%. GAAP EPS increased to $0.62 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 6% to $0.82. for the first nine months of 2020, total revenue growth was 3% with underlying growth of 1%. Our adjusted operating income grew 12%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 180 basis points to 23.8% and our adjusted EPS increased 9% to $3.77. in Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue grew 4% to $2.3 billion with underlying growth of 2%. A decline in fiduciary interest income driven by lower interest rates served as 100 basis point drag on underlying growth in the third quarter and 60 basis point drag for the nine months. operating income increased 52% to $333 million. adjusted operating income increased 24% to $388 million and the adjusted margin increased 280 basis points to 20.2%. for the first nine months of the year, RIS revenue was $7.8 billion, representing growth of 8% and underlying growth of 3%. adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year was up 20% to $2.1 billion. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2 billion with underlying growth of 3% representing another solid quarter of growth considering the macroeconomic headwinds. U.S. and Canada grew 5% on an underlying basis in the quarter, led by strong growth in MMA. This marks the 13th consecutive quarter. The U.S. and Canada has delivered 3% or higher underlying growth. In international underlying growth was 2% with Asia Pacific up 4%, Latin America up 2% and EMEA flat. For the first nine months, revenue at Marsh was $6.2 billion with underlying growth of 3%. U.s. and Canada was up 4% while international was up 2%. Guy Carpenter continues to have a great year. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $274 million in the quarter, which was flat on both the reported and underlying basis. As we disclosed previously, Guy Carpenter's growth in the third quarter of last year benefited from the true-up of a multi-year contract. Excluding this item, underlying growth was 6% in the quarter and reflects continued solid results across the portfolio. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter's revenue was $1.5 billion, 6% underlying growth. In Consulting, third quarter revenue was $1.7 billion. underlying revenue was down 4% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of the current crisis. adjusted operating income decreased 5% to $306 million while the adjusted margin increased 20 basis points to 18.9%. For the first nine months of the year, Consulting's revenue was $5.1 billion, down 2% on an underlying basis and adjusted operating income declined 6% to $860 million. Mercer's revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, down 3% on an underlying basis. Wealth underlying revenue decreased 3% led by a decline in DB. within wealth however, we continue to see growth in the outsourced CIO business and at the end of the quarter, our assets under management were approximately $321 billion. This 5% sequential increase was driven by strong new funding and marketing. health underlying growth is flat in the quarter and career underlying revenue was down 11%. Careers, where we have more discretionary projects business, which is seeing the most impact from the crisis. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $3.6 billion, down 1% on an underlying basis. Oliver Wyman's revenue was $480 million in the quarter, a decline of 6% on an underlying basis. This marks an improvement from the pace of decline in the second quarter, and reflects stronger sales and continued solid delivery of projects. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.5 billion, a decline of 6% on an underlying basis. Turning to corporate. Adjusted corporate expense was $56 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately $58 million in the fourth quarter. We had $2 million of investment income on an adjusted basis in the quarter and we continue to expect the contribution from investment income for the balance of 2020 will be immaterial. On a GAAP basis, investment income was a loss of $14 million in the quarter, primarily reflecting a change in the market value of our remaining investment in Alexander Forbes. foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind to adjusted EPS in the quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a slight benefit in the fourth quarter. our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.5% compared with 25% in the third quarter last year. excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 25.5%. Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.6%, compared with 24.3% last year, and we expect the full-year rate to be between 25% and 26% due in part to an expected impact from discrete items in the fourth quarter. Turning to the JLT integration, I'm happy to report that the bulk of integration activity is largely behind this, and we have achieved the vast majority of the targeted savings, which is well ahead of schedule. We incurred $44 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the third quarter, bringing the total to-date to $516 million. The remaining work to be done consists primarily of ongoing technology application migrations and the further consolidation of real estate, which will continue through 2021. I want to take a minute and provide an update to our outlook for 2020. our 2020 outlook assumes recessionary conditions persist for the rest of the year. Despite this headwind, we expect RIS to generate underlying revenue growth for the full year offset by a decline in Consulting. at Marsh, we see underlying growth in the low single digits for Q4 and the full year, a solid result in the face of the pandemic. at Guy carpenter, we continue to expect mid single-digit underlying growth for the full year. Guy Carpenter's fourth quarter could be impacted by difficult comparisons to last year although Q4 is a seasonally small quarter. We continue to expect Mercer's underlying revenue will decline in the fourth quarter and be down modestly for the full year. Finally, revenue weakness in Oliver Wyman will persist through the fourth quarter. As we learn to live with the virus, we are progressively moving to a more normal course for business decisions. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings will be impacted by a sequential uptick in expenses due to a general loosening of spending restrictions, strategic hiring, and costs associated with employee related activity that would have taken place over the course of the year, but was delayed due to the pandemic. Despite this, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook for the year to mid single-digit growth. In addition, based on this outlook, we expect our overall margin will increase, which would Mark our 13th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. We ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash, saw a sequential reduction in outstanding debt and have the entirety of our combined $2.8 billion of credit facilities available. We remain committed to deleveraging and we continue to expect to reduce overall debt this year. Total debt at the end of the third quarter was $12.7 billion, down from $13.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting the repayment of a $500 million one-year term loan ahead of its schedule maturity. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in December when 700 million of senior notes mature. Interest expense in the third quarter was $128 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $127 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter. While uncertainty remains high in the current environment, we feel the actions we have taken to secure additional flexibility along with our strong performance to-date positions us well to continue to navigate the crisis from a liquidity perspective. In line with our prior commentary, we did not repurchase any shares in the third quarter and do not plan to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2020. Uses of cash in the third quarter totaled $295 million and included $59 million for acquisitions, and $236 million for dividends. for the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $1.5 billion and included $753 million for acquisitions and $702 million for dividends. Overall, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. We are on track to deliver a solid year, despite the ongoing global pandemic. our results reflect the strength and resilience of our company and our colleagues, and we remain focused on striking the right balance between delivering solid results today while continuing to invest for growth in the future. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan. Sure. Hey Jimmy. I actually, the whole cash generation capital management story this year has been a great one for us. Remember back to some of the guidance we gave earlier in the year about capital deployment. We're largely on track despite the pandemic with those plans. And if you remember coming into the year, the priority for dividend, acquisitions and the big chunk of the leveraging, and as I said, we're largely on track with all of those. So, we raised our dividend. We've got a very active year for M&A, but despite the pandemic, as Dan said earlier, I think it's actually remarkable as an M&A biggest year in terms of deal value and revenue acquired. So, we've been active on the M&A and a front, and we're still committed to de-leveraging this was going to be a big year of debt paid down. And that's really what you're going to see in the fourth quarter. And we may actually see a little bit more M&A activity in the fourth quarter. So coming into the year, we didn't say share repurchase was going to be that much in the cards and we're coming in very consistent with the original plans coming into the year."

So, we're pleased to see that we had a better Q3, than Q2, but we cannot say whether the outcome what it will be because of course, it's very related to the conditions out there and as we're seeing lock downs continuing. If I pivot to health, for example, we've had aspects of our health business and has been super resilient. There's been lots of demand for digital health, such as our Darwin platform solution voluntary benefit support from a health wellness and mental health issues and delights. But there's a part of our health business, that's also related to the head counts at our clients. And therefore, depending on the level of lay off that we say, we see some headwinds in that way. Although so far for 2020, it's not been too severe. And finally on the wealth business, there's a large part of the wealth business that is regulatory work that is recurring. So it can be resilient. We've had a little bit less of project work as the markets calmed down in Q3 versus the first half of the year, but the very bright spot is our OCIO business. So our implemented asset business we've seen improved capital market performance in Q3, but also very strong net inflows. And we had a very similar pattern during the global financial crisis where when you see volatility, uncertainty on the market, the client wants strong governance, agility and then transaction of assets, and a slight to quality. So, we're seeing very strong inflows and very strong pipeline building in that business. So, that's for Mercer."

Second quarter 2020 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's Web site at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our Earnings Release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC Web site. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures. Please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies.\nDan Glaser: Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. I am pleased with our second quarter results which demonstrates Marsh & McLennan's strength and resiliency as we navigate the current global health crisis and economic recession. The world is experiencing too dramatic and uncertain, unforeseen events at the same time. First, the global pandemic and second, the global economic crisis driven by an unprecedented simultaneous lockdown in almost every part of the world. In addition, society reached the breaking point on racial inequalities which has persisted for far too long. In the face of this extraordinary combination of events, Marsh & McLennan colleagues rose to the occasion and continued to serve our clients with excellence and distinction. I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues globally and our leadership team for their dedication and outstanding execution in these challenging times. While the impact to our business from the economic downturn and health crisis so far has been manageable, we live in troubled times and the conditions in many parts of the world remain extremely difficult and uncertain. The world may have avoided the worst case health and economic scenarios, but this downturn may be longer than many initially expected, when ways of viruses resurgence in certain geographies. While in most parts of the world we are through the initial phase of peak fear and uncertainty around health outcomes. We are now in a period of dealing with the economic fallout and living with the continuing health implications. These economic and health uncertainties could last a year or longer, challenging companies well into 2021. Regardless of the shape of the recovery, we have proven our businesses resilience, we have strong control over our expense space and the need for our advice and solutions is now more critical than ever. Our management team has made a number of tough calls and I believe the right ones as we navigated through these first months of the crisis. We continue to take actions that balance the short-term with a focus on positioning for the long-term. These include maintain jobs in the thick of the pandemic, as well as proceeding with our annual salary increases, avoiding a hiring freeze and continuing to make strategic hires in the face of industry dislocation. And moving forward with several acquisitions so far this year in MMA as we continue to pursue inorganic growth. We've cut back significantly on discretionary expenses and have set a high bar for what is deemed essential spending, which is driven costs down while we preserve jobs and salaries. We also enhanced our liquidity by establishing a new credit facility and issuing additional long-term debt. Looking beyond the current crisis, I believe we will emerge as a stronger firm. Our organization has never been flatter, faster and better connected than it is today. I want to pause and comment on racial inequality. The racial inequality in our society is a pervasive issue that recently came to a breaking point with the tragic death of George Floyd. Systemic racism has caused inequities, injustice, healthcare, education, careers, wealth, creation and freedom. The recent events have been shocking to me and all too familiar to others. Our executive committee has been fully engaged, listening to our black colleagues and others, speaking up alongside them and implementing concrete actions to make a difference. We are determined to seize this moment to create a more diverse and inclusive company. In these dynamic times, we are pressing to develop new solutions to address rising and evolving risk globally. Our businesses are collaborating more than ever to bring the power of our firm to clients. For example, [Washington Carpenter] [ph] leading the industry to create a new market for pandemic insurance. We initiated a dialogue in Congress in late March to create a public private partnership for pandemic risk, which would facilitate future economic recovery and enhance resiliency among companies going forward. We are also developing public private pandemic solutions in multiple countries. And I was wondering we developed a leading disease progression model, Pandemic Navigator, which is being used by governments and companies to predict virus spreads and guide decisions. Both Oliver Wyman and Mercer are advising clients across a number of industries utilizing Pandemic Navigator to make returns to office plans, understand future demands recovery patterns, manage supply chains for cash credit losses and assess early warning signals. Mercer and Marshall's consulting have also joined forces to work with employers on their new normal strategies. Helping clients use this time as an opportunity to adapt, reinvent and become more resilient. In summary, I am proud of how our company continues to innovate while responding to the immediate pressures caused by the crisis. Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. P&C insurance pricing continues to accelerate. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index increased 19% year-over-year versus 14% in the first quarter and 11% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Global property insurance was up 19% and global financial and professional lives were up 37%, while global casualty rates are up 7% on average. Keep in mind, our index used a large account business where we typically earned fees. However, U.S. small and middle market insurance pricing is up meaningfully as well, although not to the same magnitude as large complex accounts. Overall, underwriters continue to push for higher levels of rate increases as a result of social inflation pressures, persistently low yields and a number of large underwriting losses including COVID-19. This is before the peak of the hurricane season. While capital remains adequate, the risk appetite of insurers is reduced as they are increasingly cautious in uncertain environment. Turning to reinsurance, the mid-year renewals which are largely focused on southeast U.S. wind exposure saw a meaningful rate increases. Florida peak zone property catastrophe reinsurance programs were up 25% to 35%. These are some of the highest rate increases seen since 2012. Non-Florida mid-year renewals would typically applies to 15%. Reinsurers are being cautious regarding the amount of capital they are currently willing to expose in an environment of great uncertainty. Overall, global P&C insurance and reinsurance markets remain challenging with accelerating price increases and narrowing terms and conditions. It is in times like these where our experienced advice and solutions are even more critical. Now, let me turn to our second quarter financial performance. We delivered excellent adjusted EPS growth of 12%, despite the global impact of COVID-19. Our strong EPS growth in the quarter reflects great execution on the part of our colleagues, the immediate benefit of expense management actions and the delayed impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our revenue. Total revenue was 4.2 billion down 4% or down 2% on an underlying basis, underlying revenue grew 2% in our RIS and declined 6% in consulting. In risk and insurance services second quarter revenue was 2.6 billion, an increase of 1%. Underlying revenue growth was up 2% in the quarter reflecting strong 9% growth at Guy Carpenter and 1% in Marsh, excluding a reduction in revenue we booked in the quarter related to estimated exposure declines, underlying revenue in both RIS and Marsh was up 3% in the quarter, which is a strong result in the face of the economic downturn. RIS adjusted operating income increased 19% to 752 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 430 basis points versus a year ago. In consulting, second quarter revenue was 1.6 billion, underlying revenue declined by 6% for the quarter. Oliver Wyman and Mercer's career business saw the greatest impact on the lockdown as expected. Consulting adjusted operating income declined by 13% and the adjusted margin declined by 70 basis points versus a year ago. Overall adjusted operating income increased 10% versus a year ago to 984 million. Our adjusted operating margin increased 270 basis points to 25.5%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 12% versus a year ago to $1.32 cents reflecting expense tightening and strong execution. Even though COVID-19 will impact our results for the remainder of the year, our strong second quarter performance is evidence that our business is resilient and that we are able to manage through challenging environments. While our year-to-date results are strong, the economic outlook is weak and uncertainty is still very high. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect a modest decline in underlying revenue. However, given our strong second quarter performance, we now expect to generate modest growth and adjusted for the full year, despite the decline in underlying revenue. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. We're pleased with our second quarter results, despite a modest decline in revenues driven by the current crisis; we delivered strong earnings and continue to enhance our balance sheet and liquidity position. Overall, revenue declined 4% in the second quarter to 4.2 billion or down 2% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter was 885 million, an increase of 30% over last year. Adjusted operating income increased 10% to 984 million and our adjusted margin increased 270 basis points to 25.5%. GAAP EPS was $1.12 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 12% to $1.32. For the first six months of 2020, underlying revenue growth was 2%, our adjusted operating income grew 13% to 2.2 billion, our adjusted margin increased 190 basis points and our adjusted EPS increased 10% to $2.96. Before I go deeper into our results, I want to discuss a $36 million reduction to previously recorded revenue we booked in the quarter. This adjustment reflects the estimated impact of the economic downturn on exposure units. It primarily impacted Marsh, but there was also a reduction in Mercer in health. A significant portion of brokerage revenue is recognized at policy inception including in some cases where ultimate revenue is uncertain. In these cases, premiums and commissions are recorded based on estimates of ultimate exposure. These estimates are typically not updated until the end of the policy term as variability in most cases is models. However, due to the impact of COVID-19 and the economic downturn, exposures in many lines of business will likely be lower than originally anticipated, requiring that we update our estimates sooner. It is important to note that this charge is included in underlying growth and adjusted earnings. Returning to results in risk and insurance services, second quarter revenue was 2.6 billion with underlying growth of 2% or 3% excluding the revenue adjustment. A decline in fiduciary interest income was also a 70 basis point drag on underlying revenue. Operating income increased 34% to 696 million. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to 762 million and the adjusted margin expanded 430 basis points to 32.1%. For the first six months of the year revenue was 5.5 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year increased 20% to 1.7 billion, with a margin of 33.4% up 280 basis points from the same period a year ago. In Marsh revenue in the quarter was 2.2 billion, an increase of 1% on an underlying basis, or 3%, excluding the impact of the revenue adjustment, a strong result in the current environment. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 3% in the quarter, in the international division underlying growth was flat with EMEA down 3%, Asia Pacific up 4% and Latin America up 4%. For the first six months of the year Marsh's revenue was 4.2 billion with underlying growth of 3%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 4% and international was up 2%. Guy Carpenter had another great quarter revenue was 433 million reflecting underlying growth of 9%. Growth was driven by solid retention, strong demand driving new business and a tailwind from the current pricing environment. For the first six months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated 1.3 billion of revenue and 8% underlying growth. In the consulting segment, underlying revenue declined 6% in the quarter reflecting the impact of the current crisis, operating income decreased 8% to 255 million. Adjusted operating income decreased 13% to 265 million and the adjusted margin decreased 78 basis points to 17.3%. Consulting generated revenue of 3.4 billion for the first six months of 2020 representing an underlying decline of 1%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was down 7% to 554 million. Mercer's revenue was 1.1 billion in the quarter down 3% on an underlying basis. Wealth underlying revenue declined 2% reflecting modest growth and defined benefits offset by a decline in investment management solutions. Our assets under management were approximately 306 billion at the end of the second quarter up 8% year-over-year. Health increased 1% on an underlying basis in the quarter or 2%, excluding the impact of the revenue adjustments. In career underlying revenue declined 16%, careers where we have more discretionary projects business which drove the revenue decline. The first six months of the year revenue at Mercer was 2.4 billion with 1% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue was 467 million in the quarter a decline of 13% on an underlying basis, which was better than we expected coming into the quarter. For the first six months of the year revenue with Oliver Wyman was 978 million a decline of 7% on an underlying basis. Adjusted corporate expense was 43 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately 96 million in total for the second half of the year. [Indiscernible] investment income on an adjusted basis, we had an investment loss of 7 million in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported an investment loss of 31 million primarily driven by the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in Alexander Forbes. Foreign exchange was neutral to EPS in the quarter assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we would expect FX to have a minimal impact on EPS for the remainder of the year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 25%, compared with 25.9% in the second quarter last year. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24% compared with 24.1% last year. Based on the current environment and continue to expect a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2020, excluding discrete items. The most challenging parts of the JLT integration are now well behind us as demonstrated by our strong first half results. We are on plan or ahead of schedule on all of our key milestones, including cost savings and restructuring actions. We incurred 57 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the second quarter, bringing the total to-date to 472 million. In total, we still expect to incur approximately 625 million of cash costs and 75 million of non-cash cost to generate at least 350 million of savings. We expect the majority of these costs will be incurred in the savings achieved by the end of 2020. I want to take a minute and provide an update to our outlook for this year. Our revised view contemplates recessionary conditions persisting through at least the remainder of 2020. But it goes without saying that uncertainty remains very high and conditions could turn out materially different than our assumptions, which would affect our projections. For the full year 2020, as Dan mentioned, we now expect to generate modest EPS growth, despite our outlook for a modest decline in underlying revenue. We currently expect adjusted EPS to decline in the back half of the year reflecting the full impact of the pandemic on revenue as well as some rebound in spending in certain areas. At Marsh, we still see the potential for modest underlying revenue growth for the year although the back half will be challenging. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect mid-single digit growth at Guy Carpenter. Underlying revenue growth for the second half of the year will likely be more muted, but these are seasonally small quarters for Guy Carpenter. Also keep in mind that Guy Carpenter faces a difficult year-over-year comparison in the third quarter, which as we mentioned last year, benefited from a $17 million true up of a multi-year contract. We continue to expect Mercer's underlying revenue will decline for the remainder of the year and be down modestly for the full year. Finally, revenue weakness in Oliver Wyman could persist through the back half of the year. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with 1.7 billion of cash, a sequential reduction in outstanding debt in the entirety of our combined 2.8 billion of credit facilities available. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken prudent steps to enhance our financial resources and flexibility. In April, we secured a new $1 billion line of credit and in May issued 750 million of 10 years senior notes at a coupon of 2.25%. We remain committed to deleveraging and expect to reduce debt this year, although the ultimate amount will depend on our cash generation in the current environment. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was 13.2 billion down from 13.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing a reduction of 439 million. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in December 2020, when 700 million of senior notes mature. We also have a $500 million term loan due in January 2021. Interest expense in the second quarter was 132 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately 131 million of interest expense in the third quarter. Although uncertainty in our outlook remains high, we feel comfortable that we have the resources and flexibility to manage through the crisis from a liquidity perspective. In line with our commentary on the first quarter call, we did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter. Given the ongoing uncertainty of the current environment, we do not plan to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2020. Earlier this month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.465 per share. This increase represents the 11th consecutive year of dividend increases at Marsh & McLennan. Uses of cash in the second quarter totaled 684 million and included 450 million for acquisitions and 234 million for dividends. For the first six months, uses of cash totaled 1.2 billion and included 694 million for acquisitions and 466 million for dividends. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2020. We've shown resiliency, the level of commitment and execution throughout the organization has been outstanding. And while the crisis is far from over, we believe we are positioned to continue to navigate it well. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.\nDan Glaser: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank.\nPhil Stefano: Dan, in your opening remarks, you talked about the immediate benefit of expense action with the delayed impact of revenue from COVID. And it feels like in the second quarter results, it was most clearly seen on the margin in brokerage. Something you could dig a little more into that and maybe help us understand what drove the expansion in the second quarter and then as we think about the next couple quarters, or even year or two, do the hard decisions, can they be dialed back? How do you think about managing the expenses versus maybe what your revenue expectations are at this point?\nDan Glaser: Sure, sure. So it's a good question. I'd start by saying let's look at the overall macro environment a bit. I mean, it may not feel like it, but so far the world has avoided the worst case health and economic scenarios. I mean, we're still in the early days, the economic downturn may last longer, since there were likely be waves of virus resurgence. So, when we were doing all of our scenario planning and stress testing, very early stages of the health elements of the crisis, you could imagine a lot of -- very forward scenarios, right? And it's certainly not a rosy picture from here. But some of the worst case scenarios appear to have been avoided. And so we pulled back our expenses very quickly. We're a company that believes in distributed leadership, we put a lot of authority out in the field with our leaders in countries and in specialty divisions, et cetera. But there are times where you need to pull that authority back and I have to say the executive committee and I move very quickly to essentially control the expense base of the company set a very high bar for what essential expenses were, and then, pull back heavily on other items. Not only the things that naturally fall away like T&E, but over time camps, contractors slowing down hiring, not a hiring freeze, but slowing down the pace of our hiring and focusing it on revenue producing type of positions. I'm very proud of the notion that that we and the team decided that not only to preserve jobs in the thick of the pandemic, but also we did not cut salaries. Now you may notice that our overall confidence then absolute number is down a bit. And that's because the broad category of [comp] [ph] also includes some things like over time and sales plans and some contractors and some of our variable plans et cetera. I feel pretty good about, how quickly we were able to dial back expenses. And there is a bit of a lag in terms of how revenue headwind actually turns off. Clearly, we had some good pipeline, you looked at our first quarter results, 5% underlying growth overall. So we had nice momentum and some of that momentum carried into the early parts of the second quarter and that goes away. And so we'll have a little bit more revenue pressure. And also because the worst case scenarios are unlikely to occur on either health or economy, type of macro factors we will ease up dramatically but will ease up a bit, will become a little bit more open to the other levels of investment that we could make. And so when we look at the second half of the year, there's still a great deal of uncertainty. We think that delivering reasonable financial results in the context of the crisis, while continuing to invest in future growth is the right position for us to be in.\nPhil Stefano: I understand. My follow up would be based on the actions you've seen and how the world has unfolded at least as far as I appreciate, it's early days. Last quarter, we're talking about maybe the sustainability of some of these things. Do you have any thoughts you can put around the actions you took it were hard at first, but maybe feel like the benefit could be something that -- once COVID is comfortably in the rear view?\nDan Glaser: Yes. I mean, there are certainly certain things I mean, we've been able to demonstrate that we can do placement activity and manage client deliverables on a remote basis now, it's not ideal in all circumstances, but it is pretty ideal in some circumstances. So I'm not sure we'll go running back to hopping on an airplane to go to Singapore for a $100,000 opportunity. Maybe it will be a little bit more cautious about the T&E type of spending some while ago come back, it may not return to previous levels for a long time, and maybe never. Flexible work arrangement is another item we won't see a benefit to our real estate, footprints or our real estate costs for a while because of social distancing type of requirements. But over time, could we envision more of a hybrid type of operation where colleagues come to the office and also work from home sometimes during the week and so we can go to much more of an agile workplace in many, many locations. Yes, it's probably likely. I also think that there'll be more digital. I mean, it's important to know while we slowed down our CapEx a little bit in the second quarter, actually through six months CapEx is higher than it was last year and it's because we're continuing to invest in our business. And I think that those items are things that would persist. I also I can't underestimate or the notion of how this crisis has brought the firm together. Crisis can bring out the worst in you or the best in you. And I tell you, Marsh & McLennan has risen and we have never been more collaborative and connected than we are today.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.\nMike Zaremski: First question, maybe focusing more on the consulting segment [since S4] [ph], I think investors are asking the most questions about. Dan, you said you guys have fortunately, I think maybe we all fortunately have avoided the worst case scenarios so far. Does that hold true for kind of what you all were thinking might happen to organic revenues in the overall consulting segment? Clearly they were down but maybe not down as much as at least the consensus expected and maybe you can kind of give us some updates on what you're seeing and hearing in the consulting segments relative to your thoughts last quarter?\nDan Glaser: Sure. I mean, we were pleased with consultings overall performance on organic growth. We clearly expected decline in revenue and pressure, particularly in the project related businesses. Oliver Wyman is almost purely a project business and some parts of Mercer, like the career business is very project oriented and projects tend to be discretionary in the eyes of clients. And so, I think overall a minus 6% is a good result in the circumstances within our consulting business. And both of our main businesses and consulting Mercer and OW have done a nice job protecting shareholders by really focusing on discretionary expenses within our own shop and pulling that back. I mean, every crisis is different in a lot of ways this crisis is more concerning than the global financial crisis. But when you look at the global financial crisis, Mercer was down, 4% in 2009; Oliver Wyman was actually down a bit in 2008 and more significantly in 2009 and had six quarters in a row of contraction. And so we're resilient firm, we can operate as an overall firm on that basis. And the bounce back in 2010, for Mercer and Oliver Wyman was quite good. And we would expect something similar. If there is a lack of discretionary projects on companies, it doesn't mean that they don't need those projects and that they don't want to focus on their future growth and their future ways to be more efficient and we're a go to company for them across people issues and strategy issues. And so we feel good about the consulting business. It could have been worse. And when we looked at it, I think we're in decent shape. I don't know what the second half brings. At the end, we've indicated that we think Mercer will be modestly down for the year. They had a very nice first quarter, but overall for the year, we expect them to be modestly down. And Oliver Wyman, as I said many times before, has a little bit more volatility to quarterly results than any of our other businesses. But we're well positioned and we feel pretty good about where we ended up on the bottom line in both of those areas of the company.\nMike Zaremski: Okay, understood. That's helpful. Lastly, the dollars moved a lot. I'm not sure, Mark, could you talk about FX and whether you should be thinking about it having an impact going forward?\nDan Glaser: Well, thanks, Mike. Mark, you want to take that?\nMark McGivney: Sure. Yes. The FX was not much of a story for EPS in the second quarter as we looked at the back half of the year we don't expect much impact, if rates stay where they are much impact for the balance of the year to EPS.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: I had a question on the reinsurances, that's Guy Carpenter. I think you imply the slowdown in growth in the second half in your comments. How much of that is just comps getting more difficult versus maybe exposures declining? And what's the interplay with pricing getting better, if they are possible like, are you being overly conservative or are you actually being some headwinds to growth given comps and exposures?\nDan Glaser: Sure. I mean, at the end we're not trying to be overly conservative, but we also always want to be realistic and transparent with our investor base. And so a lot of this is Carpenter, the third and fourth quarter are much smaller and so therefore the hard account or two could swing things in different directions. And as we pointed out in our remarks, there was a one off last year that we acknowledged last year $17 million a tall hill to overcome. But, Peter, you want to talk a little bit about either where you see exposure rates and whether this is overly conservative or not?\nPeter Hearn: Thank you, Dan. Jimmy, I would just reiterate what Dan says, Q3 and Q4 are historically small quarters and they're subject to volatility with the movement of business from one quarter to the next or timing. From a new business standpoint, our new business growth has been strong for the past three years and we anticipate the same thing in Q3 and Q4. But again, we have tough comparables from Q3 and Q4 of last year, but we've seen no diminution in revenue bases in buying habits. And we've done over several hundred stress tests on client balance sheets to anticipate what the rest of the year could look like from catastrophic events or an adverse situation with regard to COVID-19. So we're winning new mandates on a regular basis. I feel good about where we are for the year and as both Mark and Dan said, they're small volatile quarters and subject to change, but there's been no overarching issue that we've seen with exposure basis in revenue.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And there's been some concern among investors about E&O exposure or negligence related lawsuits against brokers. Do you have anything that you can sort of what are your views on -- what your exposure might be and any sort of quantification of what your retention would be if you were to see something because I'm assuming you've got insurance on that as well. So --\nDan Glaser: Yes. I mean, we haven't publicly disclosed the details of our E&O insurance program, so I'm not going to do it here. Our goal and our principal focus as a broker is to advocate forcefully for policyholders. We do that by obtaining flood coverages and in the event, they have a claim, we do our best to a system with recoveries and we've got very strong risk management practices, high level of professional standards, E&O training of thousands of colleagues. So at the end, it's not something that we spend a lot of time on. Obviously, there's some coverage disputes that are occurring between clients who may believe that they have some coverage within some of their policies related to COVID. And some of those clients, may end up suing everybody but that really hasn't occurred yet. And I'm not overly concerned with it. I think we have good systems and control. Frankly, just like it would be impossible today and why public private partnerships are being talked about broad scale of pandemic insurance is not insurable. It goes into the trillions of dollars of potential exposure and so on. On that basis, it's not like that every client could have gotten full scale broad pandemic protection because there's not a market for it, it had to be targeted, limited in certain industries, certain clients and very expensive.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.\nYaron Kinar: First question on free cash flows, seem like they were very strong, this quarter was curious, what drove that? I think one of your competitors have talked about CARES Act, pushing tax payments back a little bit, but any color you can offer on that. And how to think about cash flows maybe for the rest of the year too?\nDan Glaser: Sure, sure. Mark, you want to take that?\nMark McGivney: Yes. Cash generation in the quarter was strong as you said, we're obviously pleased with that. Here a number of factors contributed, the most important of which was just the strong earnings growth. So we had solid earnings growth. So that was a big factor in driving free cash flow and then there's a number of other factors, so less spending on JLT related items. If you compare it with last year, we got nicked a little bit more by FX than we did this year. And then, in any given quarter there can be fluctuation in some of the balance sheet accounts and working capital that can affect cash flows and we had good results on that front. And so whether it's the quarter year-to-date, our cash generation was strong. For the remainder of the year, it really is going to be about how our earnings trend.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then with regards to exposure or the impact of exposure declines, I just want to make sure I was thinking about it correctly. So in consulting fee, the impact tends to be more immediate. And then, RIS, it takes -- there's a bit more of a lag, is that a fair summation?\nDan Glaser: Most of the exposures of clients were actually in Marsh. So I'll hand off to john and he can describe a little bit the types of areas where you would see exposure and decline. It's more mild and consulting and generally around the health business if you're looking at employment as an example, as a proxy for the lives covered under plan, if employment is down and then the anticipated amount of premium would be down because there is a lot of slide. John, you want to talk about exposure units within the large world because that's where most of the adjustment took place.\nJohn Doyle: Sure. As Mark talked about earlier on the call, a number of different products are adjustable and exposed to the unit driven. So, some of the industry groups, marine, aviation, energy, for example, we accept make an adjustment to accrue for [indiscernible] unit over the course of the policy period. Product lines that are more impacted, commercial auto of course, were calm, transaction risk, those kinds of things. So, obviously, overall, our growth historically is correlated the economic growth and construction flows down, other investment flows down there is a bit of a lag effect. And then, so, that impacts our ability to write new business but we also attempted to make an adjustment prior period for adjustable policies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the full year EPS side. So you guys took that off for modest growth, whereas before, right, it was kind of maybe slightly negative to just about positive depending on what happened to organic for the full year. But if I think about that you guys printed just under 10% EPS growth in the first half of the year, which implies about a mid-single digit decline in the back half, which probably would have been -- where we would have been in your [prior guy] [ph] just for the second half of the year. So I guess I'm trying to package all of the comments together on -- your outlets does seem like it's better although still cautious for the second half of the year. So I think that would come together in that EPS guide, or is it something to do with timing of JLT expenses that were more pronounced in the second quarter? Just trying to understand why that EPS outlook for the second half of the year, isn't perhaps stronger than what you thought it was three months ago?\nDan Glaser: Sure. It's a fair question. And so let me address it this way. Leading the business and as our business leaders within the company do every day, is as much art as it is science. We can make the margin go up at any point in time, by drawing back expenses, by being very tough on rehiring by just pulling it off horns a great deal. The art is figuring out what should we deliver today while we're investing for the future, while we're going to position the company to emerge stronger. And so from that standpoint, the way we look at that, is yes, our second quarter performance was really terrific. But the reality is, we pulled the expense levers hard. And we felt the immediate benefit of that lower spending and the revenue came in a bit higher since there's a lag in the full revenue headwind since all the activity that's pre-COVID in terms of projects still benefited us in the second quarter. So you've got to think the revenue headwind will be a bit stiffer in the second half of the year. And because our worst case scenarios are not going we do not anticipate though the macro environment to go into the worst case scenarios will ease off a little bit on some of these transactions. And the combination of that will be that we've got EPS pressure in the back half of the year. And our focus is okay, what is the reasonable result to deliver to shareholders in a year in which we expect modest revenue decline of the overall firm. And you can look, we expect modest improvement overall in RIS and pressuring consultants. I think you can kind of cottoned on to the idea that RIS will have better margin outlook, than what the consulting division will have and we're not going to artificially do things in consulting to drive margin when the top-line is under that kind of pressure.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then, my second question is specific to Marsh. I know, you guys have pointed out last quarter that there would be a lag on that the third quarter would be worse than the second quarter. It sounds like from your comments if that still holds, I guess. My question is more thinking further out than that, if there isn't a spike in cases and no COVID kind of is maintained what think it will be today? Do you think within your business, the Q4 should represent a bounce from the third quarter? And this is just specifically to Marsh.\nDan Glaser: Okay. So I'll hand off to John in a second. Obviously, we are thrilled with the positioning of Marsh. And when we look at the future for Marsh, we couldn't be in a better position in terms of our risk and advisory businesses, our placement capabilities and our water capabilities. And I couldn't be happier with the combination with JLT. And just as a reminder, that's all about growth, growth and talent, growth in capability, growth in scale, revenues, earnings and within one year, we came together as one single formidable team, textbook integration that happens throughout the company and really kudos to my leadership team for pulling it off. We made people and structural decisions very quickly, we worked through this structure and in fact, we are ahead of schedule on total amount and timing when it comes to cost savings. Overall, well planned, well led, well executed. John, you want to talk a little bit about how you see Marsh back half of the year and as you look out to 2021, 2022 and 2023, in terms of this year to your flavor?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Dan. As we talked about the second half, it's likely to be a bit more challenging given the economic consequences of the pandemic. I don't want to get into the third quarter versus the fourth quarter. I mean, obviously, things are quite fluid with pandemic and it's hard to predict the economic consequences. We've talked about many times, uncertain environment, we've operated in, having said that, as Dan pointed out, I think we're extraordinarily well positioned. Our team is highly focused on our clients and getting the best outcome. It is very, very difficult environment. They've been there for one another, obviously, I'm a stress [indiscernible]. And so, I couldn't be more pleased with how that comes together. And there are some silver linings, of course, while overall a human tragedy, what we've all been living through the cultural integration has gone on exceedingly well. So I'm confident in our ability to perform, well on a relative basis and when things improve, we'll continue to see improved performance in the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: One quick accounting question to start. Mark pointed out in the press releases as $36 million revenue adjustment for exposure units. Does that all fall to the bottom line? Are there offsetting reductions to expenses?\nDan Glaser: Mark.\nMark McGivney: It all falls to the bottom-line, Meyer. I mean, it could be in our overall earnings and bonus formulas a little bit of impact to the extent, earnings grow or shrink for a year, but that specific adjustment, it is directed to revenue and bottom-line.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. So, I think that is a good news. Broader question, and I think this is for Dan. Back, I don't know last time we had had like, rate increases that were this powerful. Marsh was obviously very heavily fee focused, but the general takeaway was that it was able to negotiate higher fees because of the incremental work that more or less matched the revenue increases that would have come on a commission basis. And I'm wondering, given the recessionary conditions. How does that play out in the current environment?\nDan Glaser: Well, I mean Marsh over a long period of time has become a much larger middle market firm, particularly in the U.S. and the U.K. And with that, there gets to be a little bit more element of commission versus fee. And I think the last time we spoke to you was, think around about two-thirds on a commission basis and a third on a fee basis. It's not easy out there and buy, whether it was negotiating with a client or negotiating with an insurance company. And so there's negotiations that take place account by account as the level of work and what the proper level of remuneration is for the intermediary. And so it's not a direct line that revenue or premium is up and so therefore, immediately, we pop on the same basis there. This is all about account by account discussion and negotiation and trying to determine the value that we provide in the market, one as an advisor to clients but also sometimes as a distributor for insurance companies.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome: Just one question. Getting some questions from investors about just the enormous amount of change we're having with your competitors and merging with Marsh and [it can't be] [ph] Aon and Willis. And it seems like there's a private equity firm every day popping up as a competitor. What's happening with the hunt for talent, is it gotten easier or harder given all the changes, we've seen in the market?\nDan Glaser: Yes. No, it's a really good point because actually we're in the talent business that's what it is, it's a piece of business. Do we have a smarter, more creative, harder working more dedicated to client service colleagues than what our competitors do? And I'll start by saying very broadly that competition is good. Competition refreshes, competition puts you out on your front foot and keeps you very active and innovative. And clearly there's some PE that's in the market largely on the middle market part of the business. You And you scared me a little bit with your comment about the get together Aon and Marsh, and I thought you were breaking news there for a second. But I'm not going to comment in depth on anything to do with Aon and Willis. We do think that that will have lots of opportunities. I mean, I like our strategic positioning. I wouldn't trade places with any of our competitors. And on a personal comment, as somebody who's had almost 40 years in this business, I don't think the Aon Willis combination is good for clients or good for the market. But I do think it's good for Marsh & McLennan. I mean, come on, the big three becomes the big two, how could that not be a benefit to us?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips: I just one for me as well. Dan, just love to hear your thoughts on how the pandemic is influenced valuations in the M&A space for brokers.\nDan Glaser: First of all, the M&A space for brokers, where you have seen most of the activity is in the upper middle market and below. And as Paul was just alluding to, there's a lot of PE in that space and then the Mac may be a little bit different for them because the leverage levels are a bit higher. And the ability to borrow money at low interest rates, or at least probably even more [indiscernible] than it was a year or two ago. And so that's going to remain an active market. I don't think you're going to see much change in multiples right now, multiples are high, probably too high, in our opinion in some areas, but the multiples are high. So it really is, well structured the deal. With all the uncertainty out there, you probably look at more of an earn out component than what you would otherwise see a year or two ago. And you also have to be really focused on but what's the EBITDA most of the businesses which are for sale so to speak are private companies and so it all gets [indiscernible]. And I think actually the EBITDA calculation on a pro forma basis is more important to be reviewed and scrutinized and to get comfortable with the multiple itself. You want to know what will that business do in your hands and so, we're still active. We don't generally compete with PE in that space because we're generally having a more limited discussions with companies in the brokerage space, particularly in the U.S. with Marsh & McLennan agency, but we're committed to that part of the market. We think it's a great business and we will continue to be a buyer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.\nJosh Shanker: Maybe Mark could give us a little detail on numbers. But can we talk a little about T&E? And you said you're going to be starting to do T&E again, at least in some, can put the numbers behind this. How much was suppressed in the second quarter? And how much do you --\nDan Glaser: Yes, Josh. We never give absolute numbers on T&E because once you do it forever. I mean, T&E, it's not an immaterial number. But obviously, you're not talking double digits of spending and travelling and entertainment, but you have to think there's two things one, in the second quarter, you got to think T&E was off big time. Like me talking about mid 90s type of percentage points, nobody was travelling or entertaining. So that's a huge downdraft. And I may have misspoke in terms of when I talked about T&E, I don't expect T&E to bounce back in any way in the second half of the year. So, there won't be much put it this way travel or entertainment for the balance of the year, what I was trying to get across was over time, even looking into 2021 and 2022. I'm not sure T&E ever at the same level it was pre-COVID. I don't know if people will really travel as much because I don't think it's necessary as what the perception was before. So I do think over the long-term T&E may be one of those areas where we have an expense benefit and that is lasting where we will -- where T&E will obviously go up from near zero, but it won't go back to the level that it had been pre-COVID.\nJosh Shanker: So with that in mind, when I try and think about expenses in the back half of the year, I expect them still to be materially down from the second half of '19. But I know you're not giving guidance but modest EPS increase for the full year sort of implies a material down turn EPS in the back half of the year, with expenses down, I mean, I know you're not going for explicit guidance, but it seems like [indiscernible] expenses still persisting the back half of the year. I'm not sure why we should expect a year-over-year decline in earnings, even if revenues fall off a bit.\nDan Glaser: Well, I mean, at the end, we're a revenue based company. You looked at our second quarter where our margins were RIS margins were up 430 basis points, with modest levels of revenue increase that obviously is not sustainable, which means we basically shut down large swathes of the expenses of this organization, because of the great uncertainty as to what was going to happen on the top-line. We now have more clarity around what's going to happen on the top-line. And we do believe the top-line across the firm will feel a bit more pressure than the second quarter. It doesn't mean, we're going to fall off a cliff. But it does mean that some of the benefits we have in the second quarter at the momentum than we had from the fourth and the first, a base and then we're just faced with the now of revenue pressure and we want to release a little bit of some of the expense pullback drawback that we have. And as I was saying before, Josh, this is an art rather than a science. We could cut our expenses significantly from here and deliver margin improvement in the back half of the year, even if our top-line is negative, but it would not be good for the company in any type of midterm or long-term perspective. So we're not going to do that. We're going to continue to invest in this organization, the dislocation that exists in the market, the ability to strategically recruit, the movements of digitization, our technology, modernization, all of that work continues, and we're going to continue.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.\nDan Glaser: Thank you, operator. And thank you to all of you joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication as well as their support of each other, clients and local communities. I am impressed and humbled by their response during these challenging times. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning. We're pleased with our second quarter results, despite a modest decline in revenues driven by the current crisis; we delivered strong earnings and continue to enhance our balance sheet and liquidity position. Overall, revenue declined 4% in the second quarter to 4.2 billion or down 2% on an underlying basis. Operating income in the quarter was 885 million, an increase of 30% over last year. Adjusted operating income increased 10% to 984 million and our adjusted margin increased 270 basis points to 25.5%. GAAP EPS was $1.12 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 12% to $1.32. For the first six months of 2020, underlying revenue growth was 2%, our adjusted operating income grew 13% to 2.2 billion, our adjusted margin increased 190 basis points and our adjusted EPS increased 10% to $2.96. Before I go deeper into our results, I want to discuss a $36 million reduction to previously recorded revenue we booked in the quarter. This adjustment reflects the estimated impact of the economic downturn on exposure units. It primarily impacted Marsh, but there was also a reduction in Mercer in health. A significant portion of brokerage revenue is recognized at policy inception including in some cases where ultimate revenue is uncertain. In these cases, premiums and commissions are recorded based on estimates of ultimate exposure. These estimates are typically not updated until the end of the policy term as variability in most cases is models. However, due to the impact of COVID-19 and the economic downturn, exposures in many lines of business will likely be lower than originally anticipated, requiring that we update our estimates sooner. It is important to note that this charge is included in underlying growth and adjusted earnings. Returning to results in risk and insurance services, second quarter revenue was 2.6 billion with underlying growth of 2% or 3% excluding the revenue adjustment. A decline in fiduciary interest income was also a 70 basis point drag on underlying revenue. Operating income increased 34% to 696 million. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to 762 million and the adjusted margin expanded 430 basis points to 32.1%. For the first six months of the year revenue was 5.5 billion with underlying growth of 4%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year increased 20% to 1.7 billion, with a margin of 33.4% up 280 basis points from the same period a year ago. In Marsh revenue in the quarter was 2.2 billion, an increase of 1% on an underlying basis, or 3%, excluding the impact of the revenue adjustment, a strong result in the current environment. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 3% in the quarter, in the international division underlying growth was flat with EMEA down 3%, Asia Pacific up 4% and Latin America up 4%. For the first six months of the year Marsh's revenue was 4.2 billion with underlying growth of 3%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 4% and international was up 2%. Guy Carpenter had another great quarter revenue was 433 million reflecting underlying growth of 9%. Growth was driven by solid retention, strong demand driving new business and a tailwind from the current pricing environment. For the first six months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated 1.3 billion of revenue and 8% underlying growth. In the consulting segment, underlying revenue declined 6% in the quarter reflecting the impact of the current crisis, operating income decreased 8% to 255 million. Adjusted operating income decreased 13% to 265 million and the adjusted margin decreased 78 basis points to 17.3%. Consulting generated revenue of 3.4 billion for the first six months of 2020 representing an underlying decline of 1%. Adjusted operating income for the first half of the year was down 7% to 554 million. Mercer's revenue was 1.1 billion in the quarter down 3% on an underlying basis. Wealth underlying revenue declined 2% reflecting modest growth and defined benefits offset by a decline in investment management solutions. Our assets under management were approximately 306 billion at the end of the second quarter up 8% year-over-year. Health increased 1% on an underlying basis in the quarter or 2%, excluding the impact of the revenue adjustments. In career underlying revenue declined 16%, careers where we have more discretionary projects business which drove the revenue decline. The first six months of the year revenue at Mercer was 2.4 billion with 1% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue was 467 million in the quarter a decline of 13% on an underlying basis, which was better than we expected coming into the quarter. For the first six months of the year revenue with Oliver Wyman was 978 million a decline of 7% on an underlying basis. Adjusted corporate expense was 43 million in the quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately 96 million in total for the second half of the year. [Indiscernible] investment income on an adjusted basis, we had an investment loss of 7 million in the quarter. On a GAAP basis, we reported an investment loss of 31 million primarily driven by the sale of a portion of our equity ownership in Alexander Forbes. Foreign exchange was neutral to EPS in the quarter assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we would expect FX to have a minimal impact on EPS for the remainder of the year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 25%, compared with 25.9% in the second quarter last year. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. Through the first half of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24% compared with 24.1% last year. Based on the current environment and continue to expect a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2020, excluding discrete items. The most challenging parts of the JLT integration are now well behind us as demonstrated by our strong first half results. We are on plan or ahead of schedule on all of our key milestones, including cost savings and restructuring actions. We incurred 57 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the second quarter, bringing the total to-date to 472 million. In total, we still expect to incur approximately 625 million of cash costs and 75 million of non-cash cost to generate at least 350 million of savings. We expect the majority of these costs will be incurred in the savings achieved by the end of 2020. I want to take a minute and provide an update to our outlook for this year. Our revised view contemplates recessionary conditions persisting through at least the remainder of 2020. But it goes without saying that uncertainty remains very high and conditions could turn out materially different than our assumptions, which would affect our projections. For the full year 2020, as Dan mentioned, we now expect to generate modest EPS growth, despite our outlook for a modest decline in underlying revenue. We currently expect adjusted EPS to decline in the back half of the year reflecting the full impact of the pandemic on revenue as well as some rebound in spending in certain areas. At Marsh, we still see the potential for modest underlying revenue growth for the year although the back half will be challenging. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect mid-single digit growth at Guy Carpenter. Underlying revenue growth for the second half of the year will likely be more muted, but these are seasonally small quarters for Guy Carpenter. Also keep in mind that Guy Carpenter faces a difficult year-over-year comparison in the third quarter, which as we mentioned last year, benefited from a $17 million true up of a multi-year contract. We continue to expect Mercer's underlying revenue will decline for the remainder of the year and be down modestly for the full year. Finally, revenue weakness in Oliver Wyman could persist through the back half of the year. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with 1.7 billion of cash, a sequential reduction in outstanding debt in the entirety of our combined 2.8 billion of credit facilities available. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken prudent steps to enhance our financial resources and flexibility. In April, we secured a new $1 billion line of credit and in May issued 750 million of 10 years senior notes at a coupon of 2.25%. We remain committed to deleveraging and expect to reduce debt this year, although the ultimate amount will depend on our cash generation in the current environment. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was 13.2 billion down from 13.6 billion at the end of the first quarter, representing a reduction of 439 million. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in December 2020, when 700 million of senior notes mature. We also have a $500 million term loan due in January 2021. Interest expense in the second quarter was 132 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately 131 million of interest expense in the third quarter. Although uncertainty in our outlook remains high, we feel comfortable that we have the resources and flexibility to manage through the crisis from a liquidity perspective. In line with our commentary on the first quarter call, we did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter. Given the ongoing uncertainty of the current environment, we do not plan to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2020. Earlier this month, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.465 per share. This increase represents the 11th consecutive year of dividend increases at Marsh & McLennan. Uses of cash in the second quarter totaled 684 million and included 450 million for acquisitions and 234 million for dividends. For the first six months, uses of cash totaled 1.2 billion and included 694 million for acquisitions and 466 million for dividends. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2020. We've shown resiliency, the level of commitment and execution throughout the organization has been outstanding. And while the crisis is far from over, we believe we are positioned to continue to navigate it well. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan. Sure. Yes. The FX was not much of a story for EPS in the second quarter as we looked at the back half of the year we don't expect much impact, if rates stay where they are much impact for the balance of the year to EPS. Yes. Cash generation in the quarter was strong as you said, we're obviously pleased with that. Here a number of factors contributed, the most important of which was just the strong earnings growth. So we had solid earnings growth. So that was a big factor in driving free cash flow and then there's a number of other factors, so less spending on JLT related items. If you compare it with last year, we got nicked a little bit more by FX than we did this year. And then, in any given quarter there can be fluctuation in some of the balance sheet accounts and working capital that can affect cash flows and we had good results on that front. And so whether it's the quarter year-to-date, our cash generation was strong. For the remainder of the year, it really is going to be about how our earnings trend. It all falls to the bottom-line, Meyer. I mean, it could be in our overall earnings and bonus formulas a little bit of impact to the extent, earnings grow or shrink for a year, but that specific adjustment, it is directed to revenue and bottom-line."

From a new business standpoint, our new business growth has been strong for the past three years and we anticipate the same thing in Q3 and Q4. But again, we have tough comparables from Q3 and Q4 of last year, but we've seen no diminution in revenue bases in buying habits. And we've done over several hundred stress tests on client balance sheets to anticipate what the rest of the year could look like from catastrophic events or an adverse situation with regard to COVID-19. So we're winning new mandates on a regular basis. I feel good about where we are for the year and as both Mark and Dan said, they're small volatile quarters and subject to change, but there's been no overarching issue that we've seen with exposure basis in revenue."

I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. I am pleased with our second quarter results which demonstrates Marsh & McLennan's strength and resiliency as we navigate the current global health crisis and economic recession. The world is experiencing too dramatic and uncertain, unforeseen events at the same time. First, the global pandemic and second, the global economic crisis driven by an unprecedented simultaneous lockdown in almost every part of the world. In addition, society reached the breaking point on racial inequalities which has persisted for far too long. In the face of this extraordinary combination of events, Marsh & McLennan colleagues rose to the occasion and continued to serve our clients with excellence and distinction. I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues globally and our leadership team for their dedication and outstanding execution in these challenging times. While the impact to our business from the economic downturn and health crisis so far has been manageable, we live in troubled times and the conditions in many parts of the world remain extremely difficult and uncertain. The world may have avoided the worst case health and economic scenarios, but this downturn may be longer than many initially expected, when ways of viruses resurgence in certain geographies. While in most parts of the world we are through the initial phase of peak fear and uncertainty around health outcomes. We are now in a period of dealing with the economic fallout and living with the continuing health implications. These economic and health uncertainties could last a year or longer, challenging companies well into 2021. Regardless of the shape of the recovery, we have proven our businesses resilience, we have strong control over our expense space and the need for our advice and solutions is now more critical than ever. Our management team has made a number of tough calls and I believe the right ones as we navigated through these first months of the crisis. We continue to take actions that balance the short-term with a focus on positioning for the long-term. These include maintain jobs in the thick of the pandemic, as well as proceeding with our annual salary increases, avoiding a hiring freeze and continuing to make strategic hires in the face of industry dislocation. And moving forward with several acquisitions so far this year in MMA as we continue to pursue inorganic growth. We've cut back significantly on discretionary expenses and have set a high bar for what is deemed essential spending, which is driven costs down while we preserve jobs and salaries. We also enhanced our liquidity by establishing a new credit facility and issuing additional long-term debt. Looking beyond the current crisis, I believe we will emerge as a stronger firm. Our organization has never been flatter, faster and better connected than it is today. I want to pause and comment on racial inequality. The racial inequality in our society is a pervasive issue that recently came to a breaking point with the tragic death of George Floyd. Systemic racism has caused inequities, injustice, healthcare, education, careers, wealth, creation and freedom. The recent events have been shocking to me and all too familiar to others. Our executive committee has been fully engaged, listening to our black colleagues and others, speaking up alongside them and implementing concrete actions to make a difference. We are determined to seize this moment to create a more diverse and inclusive company. In these dynamic times, we are pressing to develop new solutions to address rising and evolving risk globally. Our businesses are collaborating more than ever to bring the power of our firm to clients. For example, [Washington Carpenter] [ph] leading the industry to create a new market for pandemic insurance. We initiated a dialogue in Congress in late March to create a public private partnership for pandemic risk, which would facilitate future economic recovery and enhance resiliency among companies going forward. We are also developing public private pandemic solutions in multiple countries. And I was wondering we developed a leading disease progression model, Pandemic Navigator, which is being used by governments and companies to predict virus spreads and guide decisions. Both Oliver Wyman and Mercer are advising clients across a number of industries utilizing Pandemic Navigator to make returns to office plans, understand future demands recovery patterns, manage supply chains for cash credit losses and assess early warning signals. Mercer and Marshall's consulting have also joined forces to work with employers on their new normal strategies. Helping clients use this time as an opportunity to adapt, reinvent and become more resilient. In summary, I am proud of how our company continues to innovate while responding to the immediate pressures caused by the crisis. Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. P&C insurance pricing continues to accelerate. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index increased 19% year-over-year versus 14% in the first quarter and 11% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Global property insurance was up 19% and global financial and professional lives were up 37%, while global casualty rates are up 7% on average. Keep in mind, our index used a large account business where we typically earned fees. However, U.S. small and middle market insurance pricing is up meaningfully as well, although not to the same magnitude as large complex accounts. Overall, underwriters continue to push for higher levels of rate increases as a result of social inflation pressures, persistently low yields and a number of large underwriting losses including COVID-19. This is before the peak of the hurricane season. While capital remains adequate, the risk appetite of insurers is reduced as they are increasingly cautious in uncertain environment. Turning to reinsurance, the mid-year renewals which are largely focused on southeast U.S. wind exposure saw a meaningful rate increases. Florida peak zone property catastrophe reinsurance programs were up 25% to 35%. These are some of the highest rate increases seen since 2012. Non-Florida mid-year renewals would typically applies to 15%. Reinsurers are being cautious regarding the amount of capital they are currently willing to expose in an environment of great uncertainty. Overall, global P&C insurance and reinsurance markets remain challenging with accelerating price increases and narrowing terms and conditions. It is in times like these where our experienced advice and solutions are even more critical. Now, let me turn to our second quarter financial performance. We delivered excellent adjusted EPS growth of 12%, despite the global impact of COVID-19. Our strong EPS growth in the quarter reflects great execution on the part of our colleagues, the immediate benefit of expense management actions and the delayed impact of the COVID-19 crisis on our revenue. Total revenue was 4.2 billion down 4% or down 2% on an underlying basis, underlying revenue grew 2% in our RIS and declined 6% in consulting. In risk and insurance services second quarter revenue was 2.6 billion, an increase of 1%. Underlying revenue growth was up 2% in the quarter reflecting strong 9% growth at Guy Carpenter and 1% in Marsh, excluding a reduction in revenue we booked in the quarter related to estimated exposure declines, underlying revenue in both RIS and Marsh was up 3% in the quarter, which is a strong result in the face of the economic downturn. RIS adjusted operating income increased 19% to 752 million and the adjusted operating margin expanded 430 basis points versus a year ago. In consulting, second quarter revenue was 1.6 billion, underlying revenue declined by 6% for the quarter. Oliver Wyman and Mercer's career business saw the greatest impact on the lockdown as expected. Consulting adjusted operating income declined by 13% and the adjusted margin declined by 70 basis points versus a year ago. Overall adjusted operating income increased 10% versus a year ago to 984 million. Our adjusted operating margin increased 270 basis points to 25.5%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 12% versus a year ago to $1.32 cents reflecting expense tightening and strong execution. Even though COVID-19 will impact our results for the remainder of the year, our strong second quarter performance is evidence that our business is resilient and that we are able to manage through challenging environments. While our year-to-date results are strong, the economic outlook is weak and uncertainty is still very high. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect a modest decline in underlying revenue. However, given our strong second quarter performance, we now expect to generate modest growth and adjusted for the full year, despite the decline in underlying revenue. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. Thanks, Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin the Q&A. Sure, sure. So it's a good question. I'd start by saying let's look at the overall macro environment a bit. I mean, it may not feel like it, but so far the world has avoided the worst case health and economic scenarios. I mean, we're still in the early days, the economic downturn may last longer, since there were likely be waves of virus resurgence. So, when we were doing all of our scenario planning and stress testing, very early stages of the health elements of the crisis, you could imagine a lot of -- very forward scenarios, right? And it's certainly not a rosy picture from here. But some of the worst case scenarios appear to have been avoided. And so we pulled back our expenses very quickly. We're a company that believes in distributed leadership, we put a lot of authority out in the field with our leaders in countries and in specialty divisions, et cetera. But there are times where you need to pull that authority back and I have to say the executive committee and I move very quickly to essentially control the expense base of the company set a very high bar for what essential expenses were, and then, pull back heavily on other items. Not only the things that naturally fall away like T&E, but over time camps, contractors slowing down hiring, not a hiring freeze, but slowing down the pace of our hiring and focusing it on revenue producing type of positions. I'm very proud of the notion that that we and the team decided that not only to preserve jobs in the thick of the pandemic, but also we did not cut salaries. Now you may notice that our overall confidence then absolute number is down a bit. And that's because the broad category of [comp] [ph] also includes some things like over time and sales plans and some contractors and some of our variable plans et cetera. I feel pretty good about, how quickly we were able to dial back expenses. And there is a bit of a lag in terms of how revenue headwind actually turns off. Clearly, we had some good pipeline, you looked at our first quarter results, 5% underlying growth overall. So we had nice momentum and some of that momentum carried into the early parts of the second quarter and that goes away. And so we'll have a little bit more revenue pressure. And also because the worst case scenarios are unlikely to occur on either health or economy, type of macro factors we will ease up dramatically but will ease up a bit, will become a little bit more open to the other levels of investment that we could make. And so when we look at the second half of the year, there's still a great deal of uncertainty. We think that delivering reasonable financial results in the context of the crisis, while continuing to invest in future growth is the right position for us to be in. Yes. I mean, there are certainly certain things I mean, we've been able to demonstrate that we can do placement activity and manage client deliverables on a remote basis now, it's not ideal in all circumstances, but it is pretty ideal in some circumstances. So I'm not sure we'll go running back to hopping on an airplane to go to Singapore for a $100,000 opportunity. Maybe it will be a little bit more cautious about the T&E type of spending some while ago come back, it may not return to previous levels for a long time, and maybe never. Flexible work arrangement is another item we won't see a benefit to our real estate, footprints or our real estate costs for a while because of social distancing type of requirements. But over time, could we envision more of a hybrid type of operation where colleagues come to the office and also work from home sometimes during the week and so we can go to much more of an agile workplace in many, many locations. Yes, it's probably likely. I also think that there'll be more digital. I mean, it's important to know while we slowed down our CapEx a little bit in the second quarter, actually through six months CapEx is higher than it was last year and it's because we're continuing to invest in our business. And I think that those items are things that would persist. I also I can't underestimate or the notion of how this crisis has brought the firm together. Crisis can bring out the worst in you or the best in you. And I tell you, Marsh & McLennan has risen and we have never been more collaborative and connected than we are today. Sure. I mean, we were pleased with consultings overall performance on organic growth. We clearly expected decline in revenue and pressure, particularly in the project related businesses. Oliver Wyman is almost purely a project business and some parts of Mercer, like the career business is very project oriented and projects tend to be discretionary in the eyes of clients. And so, I think overall a minus 6% is a good result in the circumstances within our consulting business. And both of our main businesses and consulting Mercer and OW have done a nice job protecting shareholders by really focusing on discretionary expenses within our own shop and pulling that back. I mean, every crisis is different in a lot of ways this crisis is more concerning than the global financial crisis. But when you look at the global financial crisis, Mercer was down, 4% in 2009; Oliver Wyman was actually down a bit in 2008 and more significantly in 2009 and had six quarters in a row of contraction. And so we're resilient firm, we can operate as an overall firm on that basis. And the bounce back in 2010, for Mercer and Oliver Wyman was quite good. And we would expect something similar. If there is a lack of discretionary projects on companies, it doesn't mean that they don't need those projects and that they don't want to focus on their future growth and their future ways to be more efficient and we're a go to company for them across people issues and strategy issues. And so we feel good about the consulting business. It could have been worse. And when we looked at it, I think we're in decent shape. I don't know what the second half brings. At the end, we've indicated that we think Mercer will be modestly down for the year. They had a very nice first quarter, but overall for the year, we expect them to be modestly down. And Oliver Wyman, as I said many times before, has a little bit more volatility to quarterly results than any of our other businesses. But we're well positioned and we feel pretty good about where we ended up on the bottom line in both of those areas of the company. Well, thanks, Mike. Mark, you want to take that? Sure. I mean, at the end we're not trying to be overly conservative, but we also always want to be realistic and transparent with our investor base. And so a lot of this is Carpenter, the third and fourth quarter are much smaller and so therefore the hard account or two could swing things in different directions. And as we pointed out in our remarks, there was a one off last year that we acknowledged last year $17 million a tall hill to overcome. But, Peter, you want to talk a little bit about either where you see exposure rates and whether this is overly conservative or not? Yes. I mean, we haven't publicly disclosed the details of our E&O insurance program, so I'm not going to do it here. Our goal and our principal focus as a broker is to advocate forcefully for policyholders. We do that by obtaining flood coverages and in the event, they have a claim, we do our best to a system with recoveries and we've got very strong risk management practices, high level of professional standards, E&O training of thousands of colleagues. So at the end, it's not something that we spend a lot of time on. Obviously, there's some coverage disputes that are occurring between clients who may believe that they have some coverage within some of their policies related to COVID. And some of those clients, may end up suing everybody but that really hasn't occurred yet. And I'm not overly concerned with it. I think we have good systems and control. Frankly, just like it would be impossible today and why public private partnerships are being talked about broad scale of pandemic insurance is not insurable. It goes into the trillions of dollars of potential exposure and so on. On that basis, it's not like that every client could have gotten full scale broad pandemic protection because there's not a market for it, it had to be targeted, limited in certain industries, certain clients and very expensive. Sure, sure. Mark, you want to take that? Most of the exposures of clients were actually in Marsh. So I'll hand off to john and he can describe a little bit the types of areas where you would see exposure and decline. It's more mild and consulting and generally around the health business if you're looking at employment as an example, as a proxy for the lives covered under plan, if employment is down and then the anticipated amount of premium would be down because there is a lot of slide. John, you want to talk about exposure units within the large world because that's where most of the adjustment took place. Sure. It's a fair question. And so let me address it this way. Leading the business and as our business leaders within the company do every day, is as much art as it is science. We can make the margin go up at any point in time, by drawing back expenses, by being very tough on rehiring by just pulling it off horns a great deal. The art is figuring out what should we deliver today while we're investing for the future, while we're going to position the company to emerge stronger. And so from that standpoint, the way we look at that, is yes, our second quarter performance was really terrific. But the reality is, we pulled the expense levers hard. And we felt the immediate benefit of that lower spending and the revenue came in a bit higher since there's a lag in the full revenue headwind since all the activity that's pre-COVID in terms of projects still benefited us in the second quarter. So you've got to think the revenue headwind will be a bit stiffer in the second half of the year. And because our worst case scenarios are not going we do not anticipate though the macro environment to go into the worst case scenarios will ease off a little bit on some of these transactions. And the combination of that will be that we've got EPS pressure in the back half of the year. And our focus is okay, what is the reasonable result to deliver to shareholders in a year in which we expect modest revenue decline of the overall firm. And you can look, we expect modest improvement overall in RIS and pressuring consultants. I think you can kind of cottoned on to the idea that RIS will have better margin outlook, than what the consulting division will have and we're not going to artificially do things in consulting to drive margin when the top-line is under that kind of pressure. Okay. So I'll hand off to John in a second. Obviously, we are thrilled with the positioning of Marsh. And when we look at the future for Marsh, we couldn't be in a better position in terms of our risk and advisory businesses, our placement capabilities and our water capabilities. And I couldn't be happier with the combination with JLT. And just as a reminder, that's all about growth, growth and talent, growth in capability, growth in scale, revenues, earnings and within one year, we came together as one single formidable team, textbook integration that happens throughout the company and really kudos to my leadership team for pulling it off. We made people and structural decisions very quickly, we worked through this structure and in fact, we are ahead of schedule on total amount and timing when it comes to cost savings. Overall, well planned, well led, well executed. John, you want to talk a little bit about how you see Marsh back half of the year and as you look out to 2021, 2022 and 2023, in terms of this year to your flavor? Mark. Well, I mean Marsh over a long period of time has become a much larger middle market firm, particularly in the U.S. and the U.K. And with that, there gets to be a little bit more element of commission versus fee. And I think the last time we spoke to you was, think around about two-thirds on a commission basis and a third on a fee basis. It's not easy out there and buy, whether it was negotiating with a client or negotiating with an insurance company. And so there's negotiations that take place account by account as the level of work and what the proper level of remuneration is for the intermediary. And so it's not a direct line that revenue or premium is up and so therefore, immediately, we pop on the same basis there. This is all about account by account discussion and negotiation and trying to determine the value that we provide in the market, one as an advisor to clients but also sometimes as a distributor for insurance companies. Yes. No, it's a really good point because actually we're in the talent business that's what it is, it's a piece of business. Do we have a smarter, more creative, harder working more dedicated to client service colleagues than what our competitors do? And I'll start by saying very broadly that competition is good. Competition refreshes, competition puts you out on your front foot and keeps you very active and innovative. And clearly there's some PE that's in the market largely on the middle market part of the business. You And you scared me a little bit with your comment about the get together Aon and Marsh, and I thought you were breaking news there for a second. But I'm not going to comment in depth on anything to do with Aon and Willis. We do think that that will have lots of opportunities. I mean, I like our strategic positioning. I wouldn't trade places with any of our competitors. And on a personal comment, as somebody who's had almost 40 years in this business, I don't think the Aon Willis combination is good for clients or good for the market. But I do think it's good for Marsh & McLennan. I mean, come on, the big three becomes the big two, how could that not be a benefit to us? First of all, the M&A space for brokers, where you have seen most of the activity is in the upper middle market and below. And as Paul was just alluding to, there's a lot of PE in that space and then the Mac may be a little bit different for them because the leverage levels are a bit higher. And the ability to borrow money at low interest rates, or at least probably even more [indiscernible] than it was a year or two ago. And so that's going to remain an active market. I don't think you're going to see much change in multiples right now, multiples are high, probably too high, in our opinion in some areas, but the multiples are high. So it really is, well structured the deal. With all the uncertainty out there, you probably look at more of an earn out component than what you would otherwise see a year or two ago. And you also have to be really focused on but what's the EBITDA most of the businesses which are for sale so to speak are private companies and so it all gets [indiscernible]. And I think actually the EBITDA calculation on a pro forma basis is more important to be reviewed and scrutinized and to get comfortable with the multiple itself. You want to know what will that business do in your hands and so, we're still active. We don't generally compete with PE in that space because we're generally having a more limited discussions with companies in the brokerage space, particularly in the U.S. with Marsh & McLennan agency, but we're committed to that part of the market. We think it's a great business and we will continue to be a buyer. Yes, Josh. We never give absolute numbers on T&E because once you do it forever. I mean, T&E, it's not an immaterial number. But obviously, you're not talking double digits of spending and travelling and entertainment, but you have to think there's two things one, in the second quarter, you got to think T&E was off big time. Like me talking about mid 90s type of percentage points, nobody was travelling or entertaining. So that's a huge downdraft. And I may have misspoke in terms of when I talked about T&E, I don't expect T&E to bounce back in any way in the second half of the year. So, there won't be much put it this way travel or entertainment for the balance of the year, what I was trying to get across was over time, even looking into 2021 and 2022. I'm not sure T&E ever at the same level it was pre-COVID. I don't know if people will really travel as much because I don't think it's necessary as what the perception was before. So I do think over the long-term T&E may be one of those areas where we have an expense benefit and that is lasting where we will -- where T&E will obviously go up from near zero, but it won't go back to the level that it had been pre-COVID. Well, I mean, at the end, we're a revenue based company. You looked at our second quarter where our margins were RIS margins were up 430 basis points, with modest levels of revenue increase that obviously is not sustainable, which means we basically shut down large swathes of the expenses of this organization, because of the great uncertainty as to what was going to happen on the top-line. We now have more clarity around what's going to happen on the top-line. And we do believe the top-line across the firm will feel a bit more pressure than the second quarter. It doesn't mean, we're going to fall off a cliff. But it does mean that some of the benefits we have in the second quarter at the momentum than we had from the fourth and the first, a base and then we're just faced with the now of revenue pressure and we want to release a little bit of some of the expense pullback drawback that we have. And as I was saying before, Josh, this is an art rather than a science. We could cut our expenses significantly from here and deliver margin improvement in the back half of the year, even if our top-line is negative, but it would not be good for the company in any type of midterm or long-term perspective. So we're not going to do that. We're going to continue to invest in this organization, the dislocation that exists in the market, the ability to strategically recruit, the movements of digitization, our technology, modernization, all of that work continues, and we're going to continue. Thank you, operator. And thank you to all of you joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication as well as their support of each other, clients and local communities. I am impressed and humbled by their response during these challenging times. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter."

First quarter 2020 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the Company\u2019s website at www.mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters.Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our Earnings Release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the MMC website.During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures. Please refer to the schedule in today\u2019s earnings release.I\u2019ll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies. Please go ahead.\nDan Glaser: Thank very much and good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.I am pleased to report that our first quarter results were excellent, despite seeing early signs of COVID-19 related headwind. Before I get into our results, I want to start by addressing the current crisis. We are living through deeply troubling times that are unprecedented in our life time. This is first and foremost a human tragedy with the health and livelihood of virtually everyone around the world is threatened, and the ultimate economic impact is still very much unknown.We do know that the next several months and possibly longer will be difficult. Uncertainty is at an all time high. There is poor visibility, business outlook has been severely damaged and confidence is down. Even though it is hard to imagine at present, we will see the other side of this crisis. In the aftermath, there will be a prolonged adjustment. I don't think any of us expected quick return to life as we knew it.However, recent data shows that, our response to the crisis is helping to flatten the curve. And we can already see some parts of the world take early steps towards recovery. And then see businesses are working at multiple levels to get global economy working again. Underpinning our work is our interaction with government and clients including banks, insurance companies and all sectors of the global economic infrastructure.Navigating the current period is challenging for all enterprises. Yet Marsh & McLennan has proven to be resilient, strong and unique. We will learn and improve as an organization during this difficult period. Marsh & McLennan has never been flatter, faster or more connected than we are today. And I expect some of how we are adapting through this period will benefit us over the longer term.I want to share some insight about how we are operating in the crisis. The safety and well-being of our colleagues is our first priority. We move quickly to suspend travel, implement work from home and put in place flexible work policies. We have a world class executive team, which I'm incredibly proud to lead. We also like to thank our colleagues who have rallied in their support of each other, and our clients.Over the last decade, we've invested significantly in the infrastructure of our business across the world. We are a globally integrated firm in terms of systems and processes. And this is proven invaluable in our response to this crisis. Within days, we were able to pivot close to 100% work from home with over 70,000 concurrent remote connections across the world and virtually no disruptions in our business and our ability to serve clients.In fact, we have a number of recent new business wins where nobody met in person. We entered this crisis in a position of strength and are focused on delivering reasonable financial performance in the short-term, while supporting our colleagues and positioning the firm to the mid to long-term. We've made several decisions reflecting this approach.In mid-March, we committed that while we are in the thick of this crisis, our colleagues jobs are secure. We also set up a $5 million support fund for colleagues in need, as well as committed to matching charitable gift contributions.Our decision for colleagues interest is first is guided by our values and aspirations as a company. This doesn't mean we are being complacent on cost reductions during this period. It is simply the right thing to do. It also speaks to our confidence in the strength of our business, which will rebound as the global economy improved.We've moved back to cut non-essential expenses and reduce capital expenditures, and we will obviously see meaningful decreases in G&A. We're taking prudent and necessary actions to manage expenses, but at the same time, we're still focused on positioning for the long-term. As an example, in early April, we closed another terrific acquisition in MMA Assurance Holdings, which will operate at the Midwest regional headquarters for MMA. So far in 2020, we announced three MMA acquisitions, and in just 10 years MMA has grown into a leading mid-sized business platform in the U.S. approaching $2 billion in revenue with 7,200 colleagues in 150 offices.I am inspired by the hard work, dedication and focus of our colleagues in this unprecedented time. It is their efforts to demonstrate the strength and character of Marsh & McLennan. The environment will remain challenging and the duration is unknown. But, Marsh & McLennan enters this period in a position of strength and we will emerge on our front foot.This month marks the one year anniversary of our combination with JLT. I am pleased to say the major elements of integration including integration of colleagues, culture and financial system are behind us. We are well along the way on technology.Our strong first quarter results are evidence that the initial period of choppiness from the acquisition is over. And we emerge as a stronger more diverse company, with more capabilities and geographic depth. We are a unified firm globally, we are working as one enterprise, smarter, more connected and more creative than we were a year ago.During these challenging times, we continue to innovate for positive change for our clients, focusing on shaping the industries in which we operate. In health and benefits, Mercer Marsh Benefits created a COVID-19 product, which is now supporting over 500,000 employees in Italy.The team then developed similar products to support people in more than 30 countries, with all regions working together, exchanging findings and truly operating as one team around the world. Our benefits technology Darwin has also proven very valuable to clients helping them rapidly inventory their pandemic coverage, address gaps and deploy creative solutions to their employees, such as access to virtual physical and mental well-being services and telemedicine.We\u2019ve also been advocating for the development of public private partnerships around the world who address pandemic risk. Marsh and Guy Carpenter are bringing policyholders, insurers and the government together to develop public private partnerships to accelerate economic recovery and restore a more resilient global economy in the future. Mercer is helping clients to assess updated pension costs and funding level projections and investment portfolio options. We've been advocating the short-term pension funding release to help businesses address near-term cash challenges and protect jobs.In Oliver Wyman, we are helping clients with their crisis response, navigating the impact on demand and supply as well as working through financial and liquidity challenges. We've developed a proprietary tool called the pandemic navigator that helps companies predict future COVID-19 development, informed by different suppression tactics and ultimately estimate overall and company specific economic impact. The tool covers more than 40 countries and all U.S. States will help our clients plan for when and how to conduct business after the crisis has subsided.Many of our clients around the world are already actively using the tool and accessing our experts, including more than 100 healthcare organizations, several government and public sector entities over a dozen major financial services companies and corporations across sectors. In summary, I am proud of how our company is responding to this crisis.Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. P&C insurance pricing continues to increase. The Marsh global insurance market index increased 14% versus 11% in the fourth quarter, and 8% in the third quarter. Global property insurance was up 15% in global financial and professional lines were up 26%, while global casualty rates were up 5% on average. Keep in mind however, our index used a large account business where we typically earned fees. Small and middle market insurance pricing increased more modestly in the mid single-digit range.Given the losses from the pandemic, pricing trends globally are likely to continue. The range of insured loss outcomes from the pandemic is wide and evolving. The loss is unique, because it is ongoing. It will take a long time for us to be fully understood. It affects nearly every country and it also led to a simultaneous asset stock. What we do know, is there will be significant losses in lines such as event cancellation, travel, D&O, workers compensation, credit lines and political risk.The potential for other losses, business interruption or otherwise make the overall loss difficult to estimate at this time. The determination of coverage for the virus will be policy-by-policy. But, we think legislating retroactive coverage is a step too far and will challenge the very notion of insurance.Declining exposure unit due to the economic fallout from COVID-19 will put downward pressure on premiums, although it will vary greatly by industry and by line of business. In some cases, carriers are offering or considering proactive premium adjustment. Although to-date it is limited in commercial lines. In some market regulators are looking for mandate refund.Turning to reinsurance, the April 1 renewals are largely focused on Japan. Following a couple of years that were the worst the Japanese tycoon activity experienced in recent times. Japanese insurers paid significant increases to a renewal of their capacity excess of loss covers. The rates and other loss-free lines were stable.The upcoming June 1 renewals are largely focused on Southeast U.S. wind exposure. Many renewal placements are expected to face upward rate pressure from continued loss created from 2017 and 2018 hurricane events. In addition, reinsurers will be assessing the impact from COVID-19 related issues.Overall, the global P&C insurance market is complex. Pandemic issues continue to evolve and this is before we enter the U.S. hurricane season. It is in times like these where our expertise and capabilities are even more critical.Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance. We delivered excellent results in the quarter with underlying revenue growth of both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. Total Revenue was $4.7 billion up 14% or 5% on an underlying basis. Underlying growth was strong in both segments with RIS up 5% and Consulting up 3%.Adjusted operating income increased 15% versus a year ago to $1.2 billion. The adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to 27%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% versus a year ago to $1.64 reflecting strong underlying growth and margin expansion.Even though COVID-19 will impact our results for the remainder of the year, our strong first quarter performance is evident that we enter this period in a position of strength and able to manage through this difficult environment.Moving to -- on to an update of our expectations for 2020. The current situation is still evolving and it is uncertain how deep and prolonged the downturn will be. Our outlook is based on a short global economic pullback starting in the second quarter, with the global lockdown lifting in the third quarter, but recessionary conditions persisting through the year.For the full year 2020, we currently expect a modest decline in underlying revenue. We are being vigilant and disciplined regarding discretionary expenses. We've strong control over our cost base and have leverage that our disposal to manage in the near-term. For the full year, if underlying revenue declines moderately, we could be adjusted EPS in a similar range or slightly better.With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our first quarter results were excellent. And although the current crisis will impact our performance this year, we faced it well positions and strong. Dan covered the high level results for the quarter. So, I will provide some additional details on our results, and then turn to updated views on our outlook in capital management.Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.9 billion, up 20% compared to a year ago or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 20% to $932 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 34.5%.At March, revenue in the quarter was $2.1 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and driven by the strong new business and renewal. The U.S. and Canada division delivered another quarter of strong growth with underlying revenue of 5%. The U.S. and Canada have achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in seven of the last eight quarters.In international underlying growth was solid at 4%. EMEA with 4%, representing the highest underlying growth in that region in 12 quarters, led by strength in Continental Europe and in Middle East. Asia Pacific was up 6% on top of 8% in the first quarter of 2019. This result is impressive considering the virus impacted Asia in the first quarter and Latin America grew 3% on an underlying basis.Guy Carpenter's revenue was $827 million up 25% or 7% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in EMEA, North America and Asia Pacific. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in nine of the last 10 quarters.In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion up 5% compared with a year ago or 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $289 million and the adjusted operating margin contracted by 80 basis points to 17.2%.As we mentioned on our last call, we expected the first quarter margin to decline in Consulting due to some quarterly volatility, and the inclusion of JLT\u2019s Employee Benefits business, whose margins have historically been relatively low in the first quarter.At Mercer revenue in the quarter was $1.3 billion with strong underlying growth of 5% continuing the trend of sequential improvement in growth from the first quarter of 2019. Wealth increased 3% on an underlying basis, reflecting low single-digit growth in defined benefits and mid single-digit growth in investment management.Our assets under delegated management were approximately $267 billion at the end of the first quarter up 1% year-over-year, but down 12% sequentially due to the decline in equity market.Health grew 8% on an underlying basis the strongest growth since the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting solid performance across the portfolio and Career grew 2% on an underlying basis.At Oliver Wyman, revenue in the quarter was $511 million, which was flat on an underlying basis. After a good start to the year we saw the beginning of virus related impacted Oliver Wyman in March.Adjusted corporate expense was $54 million in the quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $64 million in the quarter. And for 2020, we anticipate this item will be modestly lower than in 2019. Based on current expectations, we would assume roughly $256 million for this -- or the 2020 versus $271 million in 2019.Foreign exchange with a slight headwind to EPS in the quarter assuming exchange rates remain at current levels. We expect FX to be approximately $0.86 per share headwind for the remainder of the year.Our effective adjustment tax rate in the first quarter was 23.2% compared to 22.6% in the first quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting per share based compensation similar to a year ago.Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%, based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2020.April 1, marked the one year anniversary of our acquisition of JLT. And we are on plan or ahead of schedule on all of our key milestones, including cost savings and restructuring actions. We incurred $80 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the first quarter, bringing the total to-date to $415 million. We remain on track to achieve our guidance of at least $350 million of JLT savings by the end of 2021. We still expect to incur $625 million of cash costs and $75 million of non-cash costs to achieve these savings. While it remains our expectation that a significant amount of our actions will be taken in 2020, the current crisis could impact timing as we navigate through the near-term. As a result, we could see some shift in our expectations for integration costs and savings between 2020 and 2021, but our current view is the impact will be relatively modest.Our outlook for 2020 has obviously changed in light of the current crisis. We want to share how we think our performance could develop, but have to emphasize that we have less visibility into how our results could unfold over the next few quarters than at any time we can remember.Our view is based on our outlook today. And it goes without saying that conditions to turnout materially different than our assumptions, which would affect our projections. As Dan mentioned, our outlook is based on a sharp economic pullback starting in the second quarter, with the global lockdown lifting in the third quarter that recessionary conditions persistent through the year.Based on these forecasts and our internal analysis, our current view is that we could see a modest decline in the underlying revenue for the full year with the deepest declines in the second and third quarters.At Marsh, we still see the potential for modest underlying revenue growth for the year, although the second and third quarters will be challenging. We believe Guy Carpenter will see mid single-digit underlying growth for the year, with a stronger first half and a weaker second half. We currently expect Mercer could see underlying revenue declined for the remainder of the year and be down modestly for the full year.Oliver Wyman will see a meaningful pullback in underlying revenue in the second and third quarters that could be greater than the peak decline we saw in the financial crisis. We would note, however, that once the financial crisis is sided and the global economy is stabilized, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman experienced a strong rebound in underlying growth.Contemplating this outlook on the top line, we moved quickly to manage our expenses and significantly cut back on every discretionary expense across the firm. Our earnings will benefit from these actions as well as to continue contribution from JLT synergies. Based on this, if our revenues in the range that we've discussed, we could see adjusted EPS for the year in the same range or slightly better.Turning to capital management and liquidity, in addition to our existing $1.8 billion credit facility of which $800 million was unused at the end of the quarter. We recently secured additional borrowing capacity in the form of a new $1 billion line of credit. This was a proven step to increase our access to short-term funding given the uncertainty of the current environment.On our fourth quarter call, we provided an outlook for capital management and that outlook is clearly changed in light of the current environment. While we intend to maintain our dividend, it is unlikely we will grow the dividend double-digit this year. On the fourth quarter call, we indicated that we did not expect any share repurchases in the first half of 2020. At this point, we do not expect to repurchase shares this year.We remain focused on deleveraging, although the pace of debt pay down will ultimately depend on our cash flow generation in the current environment. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $13.6 billion, compared with $12 billion at the end of 2019. This increase in debt is primarily due to short-term borrowings to fund seasonal cash needs, which are highest in the first quarter. We were also holding additional cash in quarter end to fund the purchase of Assurance Holdings and M&A acquisition that closed on April 1.Our next scheduled debt maturities are in December 2020 with $700 million senior notes will mature and in January 2021 when a $500 million term loan comes due. During the first quarter, we repaid $500 million of debt that matured.Interest expense in the first quarter was $127 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $140 million of interest expense in the second quarter. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1.5 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $476 million and including $232 million for dividends and $244 million for acquisitions. Overall, we are pleased with our excellent first quarter results. We are a resilient company. We enter this crisis from a position of strength.And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan.\nDan Glaser: Thank you, Mark. And operator we're happy to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And interest of addressing questions from as many participants as possible. We would ask the participants limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] We will now take the first question from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good morning, and thank you for the prepared remarks and the update on the guidance. My first question is regarding your outlook and other I guess, if revenues potentially declined by single-digits and earnings could very well then potentially also fall by single-digit, I think that's a pretty good outlook relative to past recessions or maybe I'm wrong, maybe you can kind of talk to -- are the dynamics different from for Marsh & McLennan this time around versus the past recession are there \u2013 are you -- the business less technical or are there more kind of levers in terms of cost reduction efforts that you can pull this time around versus recession a decade or plus ago? Thanks.\nDan Glaser: Thanks, Mike. Never thought I'd miss you guys. So, it's good to have some people on the telephone. I'm getting tired of looking at the same my team every morning. So, but, every crisis is different, Mike, it all has its own unique attributes and while there are parallels to draw, you can't get really focused on, it was like this last time, so it'll be like this time. I think the important thing is, MMC is really defensive and resilient, we're not immune to this kind of crises. But for us, the impact on manifests itself we produced the management consultants series services and lower premium growth due to the explosive decline.And the explosive decline may be more significant than they were in the global financial crisis. But on the other hand, at that point in time rates were generally going down and now rates are generally going up. If the recovery is faster than we outlined in our scripted remarks, then we'll do better than our guidance. And if the downturn is deeper and more prolonged will do worse.But the impact on us, we believe is manageable. And when I think about resilience, ever think about things like, clients are going to continue to buy insurance. They're going to continue to renew their health and benefits program. They're going to do their annual actuarial work. And so, that kind of thing a level of recurring revenue, recurring engagements that we have, will continue.We mentioned that Oliver Wyman is expected to see the most significant negative revenue impact. But keep in mind, the cost structure, I have mentioned many times before the cost structure in Oliver Wyman is more variable than in the rest of the company.And so, it helps us to mitigate the earnings impact because of the cost variable cost nature of OW. Now, if you mentioned, the financial crisis and just go back in time, RIS in 2008 was 0 they were flat, and in 2009 was a minus 1. And the Consulting division actually grew in 2008 and was down 7% in 2009. And OW, back in the last crisis contracted for six quarters consecutively, and then had a pretty strong rebound after that. And clearly when we looked at OW now, it's a completely different firm and certainly has been our best blower over that elongated period. But Mike, you have a follow up?\nMike Zaremski: Yes, that's helpful. My follow up is, Dan, you talked about the extreme uncertainty regarding COVID-19 related losses, and I guess revenue impacts for the entire industry. I\u2019m curious, what are you guys seeing and your teammates seeing in April regarding commercial P&C pricing, is it actually moving higher despite the economic pressures to begin the uncertainty? And maybe if there's any distinctions between M&A kind of small, medium sized agencies versus the largest clients that that'd be great too? Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Sure and I'll hand off to John and also to Peter to give me deeper commentary. But I'll just start by saying, we're an intermediary. We're insurance brokers and on the Marsh side of the house, we do everything we can to negotiate broad coverage terms and high quality, best site available sort of thing. And that's what we'll continue to do. That's our job until to us. We're not trying to strike a balance between insurance companies and our clients. We're an advocate for our clients. And these are tough times for a lot of our clients. And so, we're working hard to obtain the best terms as possible, because nobody wants to be paying premium increases at a time when cash is king.And so, we're really focused on doing our best. And we expect in this kind of environment, there's a bit of a flight to quality. There's also higher levels of client with retention anticipated and probably softer new business as we go forward as we work through. But John you want to talk about the overall environment for COVID losses and how you're seeing the market today? We're going to be plugging john in a second. But what Peter Hearn let me go to you and talk a little bit about the reinsurance side.\nPeter Hearn: Yes, Dan. The reinsurance market pricing was already increasing prior to COVID-19. It continues to increase. And so, we're looking at this as a continuation of a market that was already in transition principally in the United States more than in Europe. But, I would imagine the advent of COVID-19 that there'll be a reevaluation of risk throughout reinsurers\u2019 entire portfolio.So, April 1, we saw increases in Japanese risk, principally based on several years of Typhoon loss. In Florida, no doubt there will be a reevaluation of risk based on the loss free from events in 2017 and 2018, which Dan mentioned in his opening comments. But I would say in general, the reinsurance market has acted responsibly in their pricing to our clients based on exposure, based on loss experience and based on their overall relationship with them.\nJohn Doyle: Okay, thanks, Peter. One other things that that we mentioned in our script is that we're entering the U.S. hurricane season. And so, this market is special. And the one thing that all companies want, but in particular insurance company see to some level of certainty with regard to, what loss has happened and how it's going to impact them. And because in a lot of ways, premium levels, at least on the rating side are determined by past losses is probably the primary determinant of what's going to happen to rates in the future is what happened to losses in the past. And COVID is really unique because it is a low developing catastrophe. So, we all know, it's going to be big. But, it's in real time right now. I mean, the losses are ongoing, and it's global. And so, on that standpoint, clearly we're going to be battling with insurers on rate levels, because in many areas, they're going to be seeking higher rate levels.\nDan Glaser: Okay, so next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So first, I just had a question on your exposure to a potentially sort of the debate that's going on, on business interruption. How do you sort of think about your exposure to claim of their client might think that they're covered for something and then the they're not I know, you had like $0.5 billion in dollar settlement in the last -- about 10 years ago, but can you give us any details on your own liability coverage redemption or the mix?\nDan Glaser: Well thanks Jimmy. Yes, I mean, the Alaska situation is completely different from this one. And so, really it doesn't apply. But, our role and principle focus as a broker is to advocate forcibly for policyholders, and doing our best to obtain broad coverage and in the event of a claim assisting them with recovery and so from that standpoint, that's what we do. We're on the client side of the table trying to develop outcomes. And as we mentioned in the script, this is going to be, a case-by-case sort of a basis This is a different wording out there. Some language is much clearer than others.And so therefore, there will be different impacts as we go through advocating for clients. In terms of our own risk management practices over the last few years, we've streamlined our professional standards, we've conducted E&O training with thousands of colleagues, and we've instituted widespread limits of liability. So E&O is a large risk exposure to us. We are in the business of giving advice, but on that \u2013 but I think we are entering this crisis with consistency and controlsin terms of how we render that advice.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay, thanks. And then -- yes, on -- this is a different topic, and you discuss this in your comments as well. But as you did, and obviously did the virus is an evolving situation, but based on your views right now, Q3 is probably going to be weak, third quarter should be weak as well. Do you expect your drop and your results to be in the third quarter or is it more likely in 2Q and you think you're going to slowly be emerging out of it in the third quarter?\nDan Glaser: No, I think that the impact, generally in insurance, you have delayed impact geared up with renewal dates and that sort of thing. It's not immediate type of impact. I think we're going to feel headwind in parts of our business significant headwinds, both in the second and in the third quarter and I can't really say which one is likely to be more significant, when I look at the overall company and as we decide before, RIS to do reasonably okay, in this circumstances here. Mercer, we're thinking, it's going to be negative, most likely for the balance of the year. But overall, we think it's probably a modest decline for the year and there'll be proper pullbacks in OW. And in fact, at the end, we're very much focused not only in managing this crisis to the best we can, but also emerging from this crisis stronger than we otherwise would be. And so, we're not fighting every end for the second and third quarter. We're fighting for the next three years, and we're making sure that we're doing the right things now to ensure that we're positioned well.\nJimmy Bhullar: That's clear. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nElyse Beth Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question on going back to the outlook as well. So, you guys pointed to, modest decline in underlying revenue outlook and said that, EPS could decline by a similar amount. So, that would imply, that your margins would be fairly stable, it'll hold up pretty well for the year. I just want to confirm that I'm thinking about that right. And then Dan going back to some of your other comments. you guys imply a sharper declines within Consulting, so is it right to think that you would see more of a margin impact within Consulting and maybe RIS margins could hold up on better during the downturn?\nDan Glaser: Yes, you you're spot on Elyse, and I would just in general, we're not really focused on margin, we're focused more on issues around revenue and earnings. And margin will be an outcome of what happens on the top line to a large extent. But you're right on and thinking that based upon what we\u2019ve said about RIS, it's likely that RIS's margin hold up and may even improve a bit. And on the other hand, it's likely the Consulting margin based upon what we said is going to occur with their revenue outlook, are going to reduce. And overall companywide, I can't make a call right now in terms of that. I do know I love streak. And we've had 12 years in a row of margin expansion, and so we won't give that one or two easily.\nElyse Beth Greenspan: Okay, thanks. And then my second question on, you pointed to business in the second and the third quarter and it sounds like just in response to previous questions that, that there is a bit of a lag on the brokerage side. So, sounds like maybe third quarter weaker than the second quarter on Consulting on some of the weakness that you called out within Oliver Wyman and within Mercer, is that more immediate in nature? And so should we think about Consulting, kind of flowing on over in the next couple of quarters kind of, in my initial results might be to the same degree?\nDan Glaser: Yes, I think the way to look at it is, what's recurring revenue and what's more project related and that has more of an impact as to whether something falls in Consulting or something falls on the RSI side. On the RSI side there's a significant amount of recurring revenue, but parts of Mercer have a lot of recurring revenue as well. And so both of those recurring revenue pieces probably have a longer time horizon or a lag effect and so you will see an impact over the second and the third quarter as those businesses adjust. Areas which has non-recurring revenue, it could be done project related Consulting in Career within Mercer it could be most of Oliver Wyman is project related. Those will be faster decline, more immediate decline. And so you would be right in the second quarter in those parts of the business coming off. Next question please, operator.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nCharles Gregory Peters: Good morning. My first question is on we've seen a number of companies in the insurance industry announced no layoff pledges. One of your peers has announced salary cuts. And there seems to be a level of social responsibility that is becoming increasingly more important. So, I'm curious about how you think that might impact things around cost saving initiatives and synergies, both currently and the future M&A.\nDan Glaser: So thanks, Greg. I mean, it's a really important question. And it's multifaceted. But, let me talk about it a little bit from our perspective. I mean, I -- we did talk about both Marsh and I that our visibility into our outlook is uncertain, so making decisions with so much uncertainty about outlook isn't easy. But those decisions are best done with clear eyes and the collective judgment of a seasoned team. So, we've spent a lot of time surveying the horizon. And in our view, as I was just mentioning, we're in a resilient business. Yes, it hold up pretty well. Some parts of Consulting are going to see meaningful pullback, but we expect them to come back strong as the economy recovers and so we've got many different levers on the expense side at our disposal.We want to preserve flexibility and optionality for as long as we can. And we want to make decisions based on data scenario planning, stress testing, and we've got all kinds of capability within the firm in order to do that, and we recognize that there are different levers for different challenges. When we think about expense cuts, and our bonus pool it's primarily giving us levers to protect earnings, and by the way just as an aside, our bonus pool in 2019 was the largest in our history, so from that standpoint, bonus pools expense cuts are going to protect earnings as we go forward.To us salary reductions and things like dividend cuts are levers to protect liquidity it's kind of like survival mode stuff. And we would -- we took some other actions, we secured additional assets and liquidity early in the crisis. We believe that that's going to help us manage through most scenarios to the slowdown in collections impact our cash flow.And as we saw in the financial crisis, there was a slowdown in the collection cycle, but it is temporary, so solving that issue by reducing pays is an awfully blunt instrument, and it can have lasting implications, starting with the notion of battering trust with your colleague base by challenging them when they're in this difficult period and the snap back that all recurring cost, once pay is lifted back again it's just a couple of things that make it really problematic.Also you can't just implement that kind of thing easily this Consultation rules in most countries and so doing some sort of broad base pay reduction programs are very difficult. And the impact oftentimes will fall most heavily and unfairly on the U.S. population and so based upon our outlook today, levers like pay cuts or dividend cuts are not necessary. We track daily cash activity so we can get early warning signs and we can react quickly if those levers are warranted, but I can't emphasize enough that we are managing this period very closely. We have never been more connected as an organization, the leadership team and I meet every day and we are watching new business, expenses, exposure, pricing, cash flows obsessively as a leadership team and we are calm and we are clear-eyed in this crisis. Our intention is that in terms of levers to avoid being late and pulling a lever, but also avoid doing something now that is harmful, and later proved to be unnecessary.\nCharles Gregory Peters: I want to pivot to the balance sheet. First its two parts that I'm just curious in the light all these get back and delay programs and premiums, if you could address the net receivable balance on your balance sheet and if you have any concerns on that. And then in the debt component, I know, you spoke in your opening comments about how you took down the $2 billion of revolver and then you paid off $500 million, but the long term debt piece increased from $10.741 billion at the end of the year to $11.231 billion and I don't understand why the long-term debt would have increased when you paid down $500 million. Thank you for your time.\nDan Glaser: Sure, let me hand over to Mark who will walk you through not only our approach on accounts receivables, but what we're looking like on the debt side. So, Mark?\nMark McGivney: Sure, there's a lot in that question. So, I'll try to hit all those points. First, just to hit a little bit on liquidity in the collection side how we feel we're positioned, Dan hit on a little bit of this, and then you go into a period like this. And you pull back and focus on the basis and liquidity and flexibility are definitely on that list. And so very early in the crisis, we jumped on this from both a financial perspective and an operational perspective.So, I mentioned earlier, in addition to our $1.8 billion credit facility, we went out almost immediately, and secured an extra $1 billion short-term line of credit, just as additional firepower going into this period of uncertainty. And remember, we had $1.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet some of that was to pay for the insurance acquisition, but we've typically run about [$1.1] billion on average at any given point in time.And so we've got substantial liquidity available to us as we enter this period. In terms of collections and visibility, we've operationalized around this like, as I said, this heightened visibility on the potential for a slowdown in collections. And in financial crisis, there was one. And so it's something we could anticipate. And Dan mentioned earlier, we've invested a lot in globally consistent systems and platforms and the finance area is one of those. So, having accounting platform and financial reporting platform uses very good visibility into accounts receivable balances, aging, trends, and all of our businesses are taking advantage of that.And the other thing we're doing is we have pretty good visibility in our major countries and just daily catch deposit and cash flow activity. And so this is something that you can anticipate and prepare for and whether it's financially in terms of flexibility or operationally to try to mitigate any impact is, as best we can. We feel well prepared. Just a couple of things on what you said, we still have $800 million of capacity in our existing short-term credit facility, not even the [$1.1] billion.So, not all of what you see in short-term debt there is revolver borrowing. And that's, we typically -- the increase we saw on short-term debt in the first quarter is what we typically see every first quarter, first quarter is when we pay out our bonus payments and we fund that through short-term financing. As I also mentioned, we were holding on to a little bit of extra cash for the Assurance acquisition.And then just the increase in long-term debt that was just a move we made early in the year just to turn out a little bit of the short-term financing. We had and it\u2019s a lot of flexibility we're building into and we built into our term structure just relating to the debt we raised as part of financing JLT. So, overall we have pretty substantial access to short-term liquidity and we feel like we're pretty well mobilized around, any risk associated with delay in the collection cycle.\nDan Glaser: Thank Mark. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.\nSuneet Kamath: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is around the environment. I mean, typically, when we would see two large competitors merging, I would have thought that could have created some opportunities for the folks that are not distracted by a large deal. Just wanted to get your thoughts on that or is that something we shouldn't expect, given all the uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic?\nDan Glaser: Well, I'm not going to comment on the potential merger between AON and Willis, I'll leave it to them to comment on it. We like our strategic positioning, we would not change position with any of our competitors. We believe that, we are set up very well, we're in the right countries, we've got the highest quality colleague base, we've got a client which would be the envy of any company in the world.And so we think that, we'll be able to grow substantially in the future based upon the fact that we're the leading provider of services around risk strategy and people and we like the way we're set up. I do know, we've learned an awful lot about integrating activities over the course of the last decade, we've done a number of acquisitions and, of course, JLT was the largest acquisition in our history. And we had a terrific year, a remarkable year in 2019, even though we were doing a lot of integration work and that is down to the quality of the executive team and the matching of culture that existed.They -- were the cultures were not identical, that's to be sure. But they're both high quality. They're both positive. They're both client focused. And so on that basis I really think that our fourth quarter demonstrate tick that box. JLT was a special acquisition for Marsh & McLennan and was the successful integration. We had 5% underlying revenue growth for the firm, but more specifically the places that really overlap the most with JLT is that Marsh at 5%, Guy Carpenter at 7%. And Mercer was 5%, but it was 8% underlying and health and so the quality of what we've been able to deliver, I mean, our adjusted operating income and almost $1.2 billion is a first quarter record for us.And so we're thrilled. We were set up for a wonderful year in 2020 in -- okay, so now, like the rest of the world we're dealing with the crisis, but it doesn't take away from the fact that we are a stronger, more capable, more creative, more connected firm than we've ever been before.\nSuneet Kamath: Got it. It makes sense. And then the quick one for Mark, I think you had mentioned both the debt maturity in early 2021, as well as some term debt. So, just the thoughts on retiring those debt securities?\nMark McGivney: Yes, sure. The short answer is, we would expect to, pay those off through operating cash flows, notwithstanding the crisis and okay, that the -- that's changed our outlook. The second and third and fourth quarters for us is generally where we generate pretty substantial cash flows and we still anticipate that, at this point, based on what we see, we're going to have good cash generating through operations for the balance of the year.\nDan Glaser: Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Phil Stefano from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nPhil Stefano: Yes, thanks. Dan, you talked about the expense levers that you have at your disposal to dial them back and trying to do so in a, prudent fashion, just given the outlook for where you think your things are going. I mean, it's not too far, but make sure they're far enough to have a positive impact. I guess when we think about these expense levers where is the expensive leverage you can pull more quickly than others. And have you thought about the extent to which maybe some expense levers don't come back, because if they're so easy to dial down this quickly, do we really need them as we think about business moving forward?\nDan Glaser: Yes, I mean, it's a great question because I think there are certain things that that are occurring which may actually last longer and maybe be permanent as we go forward. I mean things like flexible work arrangements may put our pressure on our real estate costs over time not in the short-term, but over time as an organization we have proven to ourselves and to our clients base that we can work from home, we can work remotely and do it effectively.And so there's an awful I mean, I absolutely believe that more agile environment, more digital are going to be a part of our future and that would be a real positive.Now in terms of expensive levers there\u2019s several that you can pull. I mean, I start from the idea that we have a very significant bonus pool as I mentioned before in the last 2019 our bonus pool was the largest level in the aggregate in our history as a company.And it's all here, net operating income, so we are team deep within the organization, is very aligned with shareholders and very aligned with the net operating income of the firm. And so it will be geared if the NOI is dropping while the bonus pool is not listed, and that's a wonderful lever, because it's variable, it's variable for a reason. And the other thing I would say is, we're a people business and while you may have less attrition in a recessionary environment, you still have attrition, and we thought in other recessions and we do not have a hiring freeze, in fact, we're hiring people every day, but we will control our hiring and we'll make sure that our executive team is very involved in making the decision that we want to make, but we'll manage our attrition that way and have some more control over that.Clearly, significant pullback in the use of temps for contractors and things like T&E have fallen away a lot of marketing spent. The things like conferences, meetings, events over time, all things that that we have as levers which have largely already been pulled to some extent and you can always go deeper there. But, we're comfortable in what in how we're set up. I mean, at the end, we said that we think that that our overall revenue might be down modestly as a company for the year. And if so then our overall EPS will be down modestly as well. But it might be slightly better than what our revenue would go.\nPhil Stefano: And that's the reason I follow-up and it's a quick one, but when you talk about the EPS being down modestly, if not slightly, but the correct base for that is [indiscernible] of 2019 adjusted EPS. Is that correct?\nMark McGivney: That's correct.\nPhil Stefano: Okay, thank you, Dan.\nDan Glaser: Thanks.\nOperator: I'd now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies for any closing remarks.\nDan Glaser: Yes, hi. Thank you operator and I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to applaud the tireless dedication of our 76,000 colleagues worldwide and the important role they played supporting their colleagues, clients and local communities. Times like these tested true character of an organization and the strength of individuals. And what I've seen from MMC in the past few months has been nothing short of amazing. So thank you all and have a good day.\nOperator: That will conclude today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our first quarter results were excellent. And although the current crisis will impact our performance this year, we faced it well positions and strong. Dan covered the high level results for the quarter. So, I will provide some additional details on our results, and then turn to updated views on our outlook in capital management.Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $2.9 billion, up 20% compared to a year ago or 5% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 20% to $932 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 34.5%.At March, revenue in the quarter was $2.1 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and driven by the strong new business and renewal. The U.S. and Canada division delivered another quarter of strong growth with underlying revenue of 5%. The U.S. and Canada have achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in seven of the last eight quarters.In international underlying growth was solid at 4%. EMEA with 4%, representing the highest underlying growth in that region in 12 quarters, led by strength in Continental Europe and in Middle East. Asia Pacific was up 6% on top of 8% in the first quarter of 2019. This result is impressive considering the virus impacted Asia in the first quarter and Latin America grew 3% on an underlying basis.Guy Carpenter's revenue was $827 million up 25% or 7% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth in EMEA, North America and Asia Pacific. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in nine of the last 10 quarters.In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.8 billion up 5% compared with a year ago or 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $289 million and the adjusted operating margin contracted by 80 basis points to 17.2%.As we mentioned on our last call, we expected the first quarter margin to decline in Consulting due to some quarterly volatility, and the inclusion of JLT's Employee Benefits business, whose margins have historically been relatively low in the first quarter.At Mercer revenue in the quarter was $1.3 billion with strong underlying growth of 5% continuing the trend of sequential improvement in growth from the first quarter of 2019. Wealth increased 3% on an underlying basis, reflecting low single-digit growth in defined benefits and mid single-digit growth in investment management.Our assets under delegated management were approximately $267 billion at the end of the first quarter up 1% year-over-year, but down 12% sequentially due to the decline in equity market.Health grew 8% on an underlying basis the strongest growth since the fourth quarter of 2015, reflecting solid performance across the portfolio and Career grew 2% on an underlying basis.At Oliver Wyman, revenue in the quarter was $511 million, which was flat on an underlying basis. After a good start to the year we saw the beginning of virus related impacted Oliver Wyman in March.Adjusted corporate expense was $54 million in the quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $64 million in the quarter. And for 2020, we anticipate this item will be modestly lower than in 2019. Based on current expectations, we would assume roughly $256 million for this -- or the 2020 versus $271 million in 2019.Foreign exchange with a slight headwind to EPS in the quarter assuming exchange rates remain at current levels. We expect FX to be approximately $0.86 per share headwind for the remainder of the year.Our effective adjustment tax rate in the first quarter was 23.2% compared to 22.6% in the first quarter last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting per share based compensation similar to a year ago.Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%, based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2020.April 1, marked the one year anniversary of our acquisition of JLT. And we are on plan or ahead of schedule on all of our key milestones, including cost savings and restructuring actions. We incurred $80 million of JLT integration and restructuring costs in the first quarter, bringing the total to-date to $415 million. We remain on track to achieve our guidance of at least $350 million of JLT savings by the end of 2021. We still expect to incur $625 million of cash costs and $75 million of non-cash costs to achieve these savings. While it remains our expectation that a significant amount of our actions will be taken in 2020, the current crisis could impact timing as we navigate through the near-term. As a result, we could see some shift in our expectations for integration costs and savings between 2020 and 2021, but our current view is the impact will be relatively modest.Our outlook for 2020 has obviously changed in light of the current crisis. We want to share how we think our performance could develop, but have to emphasize that we have less visibility into how our results could unfold over the next few quarters than at any time we can remember.Our view is based on our outlook today. And it goes without saying that conditions to turnout materially different than our assumptions, which would affect our projections. As Dan mentioned, our outlook is based on a sharp economic pullback starting in the second quarter, with the global lockdown lifting in the third quarter that recessionary conditions persistent through the year.Based on these forecasts and our internal analysis, our current view is that we could see a modest decline in the underlying revenue for the full year with the deepest declines in the second and third quarters.At Marsh, we still see the potential for modest underlying revenue growth for the year, although the second and third quarters will be challenging. We believe Guy Carpenter will see mid single-digit underlying growth for the year, with a stronger first half and a weaker second half. We currently expect Mercer could see underlying revenue declined for the remainder of the year and be down modestly for the full year.Oliver Wyman will see a meaningful pullback in underlying revenue in the second and third quarters that could be greater than the peak decline we saw in the financial crisis. We would note, however, that once the financial crisis is sided and the global economy is stabilized, both Mercer and Oliver Wyman experienced a strong rebound in underlying growth.Contemplating this outlook on the top line, we moved quickly to manage our expenses and significantly cut back on every discretionary expense across the firm. Our earnings will benefit from these actions as well as to continue contribution from JLT synergies. Based on this, if our revenues in the range that we've discussed, we could see adjusted EPS for the year in the same range or slightly better.Turning to capital management and liquidity, in addition to our existing $1.8 billion credit facility of which $800 million was unused at the end of the quarter. We recently secured additional borrowing capacity in the form of a new $1 billion line of credit. This was a proven step to increase our access to short-term funding given the uncertainty of the current environment.On our fourth quarter call, we provided an outlook for capital management and that outlook is clearly changed in light of the current environment. While we intend to maintain our dividend, it is unlikely we will grow the dividend double-digit this year. On the fourth quarter call, we indicated that we did not expect any share repurchases in the first half of 2020. At this point, we do not expect to repurchase shares this year.We remain focused on deleveraging, although the pace of debt pay down will ultimately depend on our cash flow generation in the current environment. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $13.6 billion, compared with $12 billion at the end of 2019. This increase in debt is primarily due to short-term borrowings to fund seasonal cash needs, which are highest in the first quarter. We were also holding additional cash in quarter end to fund the purchase of Assurance Holdings and M&A acquisition that closed on April 1.Our next scheduled debt maturities are in December 2020 with $700 million senior notes will mature and in January 2021 when a $500 million term loan comes due. During the first quarter, we repaid $500 million of debt that matured.Interest expense in the first quarter was $127 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $140 million of interest expense in the second quarter. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1.5 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $476 million and including $232 million for dividends and $244 million for acquisitions. Overall, we are pleased with our excellent first quarter results. We are a resilient company. We enter this crisis from a position of strength.And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan. Sure, there's a lot in that question. So, I'll try to hit all those points. First, just to hit a little bit on liquidity in the collection side how we feel we're positioned, Dan hit on a little bit of this, and then you go into a period like this. And you pull back and focus on the basis and liquidity and flexibility are definitely on that list. And so very early in the crisis, we jumped on this from both a financial perspective and an operational perspective.So, I mentioned earlier, in addition to our $1.8 billion credit facility, we went out almost immediately, and secured an extra $1 billion short-term line of credit, just as additional firepower going into this period of uncertainty. And remember, we had $1.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet some of that was to pay for the insurance acquisition, but we've typically run about [$1.1] billion on average at any given point in time.And so we've got substantial liquidity available to us as we enter this period. In terms of collections and visibility, we've operationalized around this like, as I said, this heightened visibility on the potential for a slowdown in collections. And in financial crisis, there was one. And so it's something we could anticipate. And Dan mentioned earlier, we've invested a lot in globally consistent systems and platforms and the finance area is one of those. So, having accounting platform and financial reporting platform uses very good visibility into accounts receivable balances, aging, trends, and all of our businesses are taking advantage of that.And the other thing we're doing is we have pretty good visibility in our major countries and just daily catch deposit and cash flow activity. And so this is something that you can anticipate and prepare for and whether it's financially in terms of flexibility or operationally to try to mitigate any impact is, as best we can. We feel well prepared. Just a couple of things on what you said, we still have $800 million of capacity in our existing short-term credit facility, not even the [$1.1] billion.So, not all of what you see in short-term debt there is revolver borrowing. And that's, we typically -- the increase we saw on short-term debt in the first quarter is what we typically see every first quarter, first quarter is when we pay out our bonus payments and we fund that through short-term financing. As I also mentioned, we were holding on to a little bit of extra cash for the Assurance acquisition.And then just the increase in long-term debt that was just a move we made early in the year just to turn out a little bit of the short-term financing. We had and it's a lot of flexibility we're building into and we built into our term structure just relating to the debt we raised as part of financing JLT. So, overall we have pretty substantial access to short-term liquidity and we feel like we're pretty well mobilized around, any risk associated with delay in the collection cycle. Yes, sure. The short answer is, we would expect to, pay those off through operating cash flows, notwithstanding the crisis and okay, that the -- that's changed our outlook. The second and third and fourth quarters for us is generally where we generate pretty substantial cash flows and we still anticipate that, at this point, based on what we see, we're going to have good cash generating through operations for the balance of the year. That's correct."

            "content": "Okay, thanks, Peter. One other things that that we mentioned in our script is that we're entering the U.S. hurricane season. And so, this market is special. And the one thing that all companies want, but in particular insurance company see to some level of certainty with regard to, what loss has happened and how it's going to impact them. And because in a lot of ways, premium levels, at least on the rating side are determined by past losses is probably the primary determinant of what's going to happen to rates in the future is what happened to losses in the past. And COVID is really unique because it is a low developing catastrophe. So, we all know, it's going to be big. But, it's in real time right now. I mean, the losses are ongoing, and it's global. And so, on that standpoint, clearly we're going to be battling with insurers on rate levels, because in many areas, they're going to be seeking higher rate levels."

            "content": "Yes, Dan. The reinsurance market pricing was already increasing prior to COVID-19. It continues to increase. And so, we're looking at this as a continuation of a market that was already in transition principally in the United States more than in Europe. But, I would imagine the advent of COVID-19 that there'll be a reevaluation of risk throughout reinsurers' entire portfolio.So, April 1, we saw increases in Japanese risk, principally based on several years of Typhoon loss. In Florida, no doubt there will be a reevaluation of risk based on the loss free from events in 2017 and 2018, which Dan mentioned in his opening comments. But I would say in general, the reinsurance market has acted responsibly in their pricing to our clients based on exposure, based on loss experience and based on their overall relationship with them."

            "name": "Dan Glaser",
            "content": "Thank very much and good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations.I am pleased to report that our first quarter results were excellent, despite seeing early signs of COVID-19 related headwind. Before I get into our results, I want to start by addressing the current crisis. We are living through deeply troubling times that are unprecedented in our life time. This is first and foremost a human tragedy with the health and livelihood of virtually everyone around the world is threatened, and the ultimate economic impact is still very much unknown.We do know that the next several months and possibly longer will be difficult. Uncertainty is at an all time high. There is poor visibility, business outlook has been severely damaged and confidence is down. Even though it is hard to imagine at present, we will see the other side of this crisis. In the aftermath, there will be a prolonged adjustment. I don't think any of us expected quick return to life as we knew it.However, recent data shows that, our response to the crisis is helping to flatten the curve. And we can already see some parts of the world take early steps towards recovery. And then see businesses are working at multiple levels to get global economy working again. Underpinning our work is our interaction with government and clients including banks, insurance companies and all sectors of the global economic infrastructure.Navigating the current period is challenging for all enterprises. Yet Marsh & McLennan has proven to be resilient, strong and unique. We will learn and improve as an organization during this difficult period. Marsh & McLennan has never been flatter, faster or more connected than we are today. And I expect some of how we are adapting through this period will benefit us over the longer term.I want to share some insight about how we are operating in the crisis. The safety and well-being of our colleagues is our first priority. We move quickly to suspend travel, implement work from home and put in place flexible work policies. We have a world class executive team, which I'm incredibly proud to lead. We also like to thank our colleagues who have rallied in their support of each other, and our clients.Over the last decade, we've invested significantly in the infrastructure of our business across the world. We are a globally integrated firm in terms of systems and processes. And this is proven invaluable in our response to this crisis. Within days, we were able to pivot close to 100% work from home with over 70,000 concurrent remote connections across the world and virtually no disruptions in our business and our ability to serve clients.In fact, we have a number of recent new business wins where nobody met in person. We entered this crisis in a position of strength and are focused on delivering reasonable financial performance in the short-term, while supporting our colleagues and positioning the firm to the mid to long-term. We've made several decisions reflecting this approach.In mid-March, we committed that while we are in the thick of this crisis, our colleagues jobs are secure. We also set up a $5 million support fund for colleagues in need, as well as committed to matching charitable gift contributions.Our decision for colleagues interest is first is guided by our values and aspirations as a company. This doesn't mean we are being complacent on cost reductions during this period. It is simply the right thing to do. It also speaks to our confidence in the strength of our business, which will rebound as the global economy improved.We've moved back to cut non-essential expenses and reduce capital expenditures, and we will obviously see meaningful decreases in G&A. We're taking prudent and necessary actions to manage expenses, but at the same time, we're still focused on positioning for the long-term. As an example, in early April, we closed another terrific acquisition in MMA Assurance Holdings, which will operate at the Midwest regional headquarters for MMA. So far in 2020, we announced three MMA acquisitions, and in just 10 years MMA has grown into a leading mid-sized business platform in the U.S. approaching $2 billion in revenue with 7,200 colleagues in 150 offices.I am inspired by the hard work, dedication and focus of our colleagues in this unprecedented time. It is their efforts to demonstrate the strength and character of Marsh & McLennan. The environment will remain challenging and the duration is unknown. But, Marsh & McLennan enters this period in a position of strength and we will emerge on our front foot.This month marks the one year anniversary of our combination with JLT. I am pleased to say the major elements of integration including integration of colleagues, culture and financial system are behind us. We are well along the way on technology.Our strong first quarter results are evidence that the initial period of choppiness from the acquisition is over. And we emerge as a stronger more diverse company, with more capabilities and geographic depth. We are a unified firm globally, we are working as one enterprise, smarter, more connected and more creative than we were a year ago.During these challenging times, we continue to innovate for positive change for our clients, focusing on shaping the industries in which we operate. In health and benefits, Mercer Marsh Benefits created a COVID-19 product, which is now supporting over 500,000 employees in Italy.The team then developed similar products to support people in more than 30 countries, with all regions working together, exchanging findings and truly operating as one team around the world. Our benefits technology Darwin has also proven very valuable to clients helping them rapidly inventory their pandemic coverage, address gaps and deploy creative solutions to their employees, such as access to virtual physical and mental well-being services and telemedicine.We've also been advocating for the development of public private partnerships around the world who address pandemic risk. Marsh and Guy Carpenter are bringing policyholders, insurers and the government together to develop public private partnerships to accelerate economic recovery and restore a more resilient global economy in the future. Mercer is helping clients to assess updated pension costs and funding level projections and investment portfolio options. We've been advocating the short-term pension funding release to help businesses address near-term cash challenges and protect jobs.In Oliver Wyman, we are helping clients with their crisis response, navigating the impact on demand and supply as well as working through financial and liquidity challenges. We've developed a proprietary tool called the pandemic navigator that helps companies predict future COVID-19 development, informed by different suppression tactics and ultimately estimate overall and company specific economic impact. The tool covers more than 40 countries and all U.S. States will help our clients plan for when and how to conduct business after the crisis has subsided.Many of our clients around the world are already actively using the tool and accessing our experts, including more than 100 healthcare organizations, several government and public sector entities over a dozen major financial services companies and corporations across sectors. In summary, I am proud of how our company is responding to this crisis.Let me spend a moment on current P&C insurance market conditions. P&C insurance pricing continues to increase. The Marsh global insurance market index increased 14% versus 11% in the fourth quarter, and 8% in the third quarter. Global property insurance was up 15% in global financial and professional lines were up 26%, while global casualty rates were up 5% on average. Keep in mind however, our index used a large account business where we typically earned fees. Small and middle market insurance pricing increased more modestly in the mid single-digit range.Given the losses from the pandemic, pricing trends globally are likely to continue. The range of insured loss outcomes from the pandemic is wide and evolving. The loss is unique, because it is ongoing. It will take a long time for us to be fully understood. It affects nearly every country and it also led to a simultaneous asset stock. What we do know, is there will be significant losses in lines such as event cancellation, travel, D&O, workers compensation, credit lines and political risk.The potential for other losses, business interruption or otherwise make the overall loss difficult to estimate at this time. The determination of coverage for the virus will be policy-by-policy. But, we think legislating retroactive coverage is a step too far and will challenge the very notion of insurance.Declining exposure unit due to the economic fallout from COVID-19 will put downward pressure on premiums, although it will vary greatly by industry and by line of business. In some cases, carriers are offering or considering proactive premium adjustment. Although to-date it is limited in commercial lines. In some market regulators are looking for mandate refund.Turning to reinsurance, the April 1 renewals are largely focused on Japan. Following a couple of years that were the worst the Japanese tycoon activity experienced in recent times. Japanese insurers paid significant increases to a renewal of their capacity excess of loss covers. The rates and other loss-free lines were stable.The upcoming June 1 renewals are largely focused on Southeast U.S. wind exposure. Many renewal placements are expected to face upward rate pressure from continued loss created from 2017 and 2018 hurricane events. In addition, reinsurers will be assessing the impact from COVID-19 related issues.Overall, the global P&C insurance market is complex. Pandemic issues continue to evolve and this is before we enter the U.S. hurricane season. It is in times like these where our expertise and capabilities are even more critical.Now let me turn to our first quarter financial performance. We delivered excellent results in the quarter with underlying revenue growth of both Risk and Insurance Services and Consulting. Total Revenue was $4.7 billion up 14% or 5% on an underlying basis. Underlying growth was strong in both segments with RIS up 5% and Consulting up 3%.Adjusted operating income increased 15% versus a year ago to $1.2 billion. The adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to 27%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% versus a year ago to $1.64 reflecting strong underlying growth and margin expansion.Even though COVID-19 will impact our results for the remainder of the year, our strong first quarter performance is evident that we enter this period in a position of strength and able to manage through this difficult environment.Moving to -- on to an update of our expectations for 2020. The current situation is still evolving and it is uncertain how deep and prolonged the downturn will be. Our outlook is based on a short global economic pullback starting in the second quarter, with the global lockdown lifting in the third quarter, but recessionary conditions persisting through the year.For the full year 2020, we currently expect a modest decline in underlying revenue. We are being vigilant and disciplined regarding discretionary expenses. We've strong control over our cost base and have leverage that our disposal to manage in the near-term. For the full year, if underlying revenue declines moderately, we could be adjusted EPS in a similar range or slightly better.With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. Thank you, Mark. And operator we're happy to take questions. Thanks, Mike. Never thought I'd miss you guys. So, it's good to have some people on the telephone. I'm getting tired of looking at the same my team every morning. So, but, every crisis is different, Mike, it all has its own unique attributes and while there are parallels to draw, you can't get really focused on, it was like this last time, so it'll be like this time. I think the important thing is, MMC is really defensive and resilient, we're not immune to this kind of crises. But for us, the impact on manifests itself we produced the management consultants series services and lower premium growth due to the explosive decline.And the explosive decline may be more significant than they were in the global financial crisis. But on the other hand, at that point in time rates were generally going down and now rates are generally going up. If the recovery is faster than we outlined in our scripted remarks, then we'll do better than our guidance. And if the downturn is deeper and more prolonged will do worse.But the impact on us, we believe is manageable. And when I think about resilience, ever think about things like, clients are going to continue to buy insurance. They're going to continue to renew their health and benefits program. They're going to do their annual actuarial work. And so, that kind of thing a level of recurring revenue, recurring engagements that we have, will continue.We mentioned that Oliver Wyman is expected to see the most significant negative revenue impact. But keep in mind, the cost structure, I have mentioned many times before the cost structure in Oliver Wyman is more variable than in the rest of the company.And so, it helps us to mitigate the earnings impact because of the cost variable cost nature of OW. Now, if you mentioned, the financial crisis and just go back in time, RIS in 2008 was 0 they were flat, and in 2009 was a minus 1. And the Consulting division actually grew in 2008 and was down 7% in 2009. And OW, back in the last crisis contracted for six quarters consecutively, and then had a pretty strong rebound after that. And clearly when we looked at OW now, it's a completely different firm and certainly has been our best blower over that elongated period. But Mike, you have a follow up? Sure and I'll hand off to John and also to Peter to give me deeper commentary. But I'll just start by saying, we're an intermediary. We're insurance brokers and on the Marsh side of the house, we do everything we can to negotiate broad coverage terms and high quality, best site available sort of thing. And that's what we'll continue to do. That's our job until to us. We're not trying to strike a balance between insurance companies and our clients. We're an advocate for our clients. And these are tough times for a lot of our clients. And so, we're working hard to obtain the best terms as possible, because nobody wants to be paying premium increases at a time when cash is king.And so, we're really focused on doing our best. And we expect in this kind of environment, there's a bit of a flight to quality. There's also higher levels of client with retention anticipated and probably softer new business as we go forward as we work through. But John you want to talk about the overall environment for COVID losses and how you're seeing the market today? We're going to be plugging john in a second. But what Peter Hearn let me go to you and talk a little bit about the reinsurance side. Okay, so next question, please. Well thanks Jimmy. Yes, I mean, the Alaska situation is completely different from this one. And so, really it doesn't apply. But, our role and principle focus as a broker is to advocate forcibly for policyholders, and doing our best to obtain broad coverage and in the event of a claim assisting them with recovery and so from that standpoint, that's what we do. We're on the client side of the table trying to develop outcomes. And as we mentioned in the script, this is going to be, a case-by-case sort of a basis This is a different wording out there. Some language is much clearer than others.And so therefore, there will be different impacts as we go through advocating for clients. In terms of our own risk management practices over the last few years, we've streamlined our professional standards, we've conducted E&O training with thousands of colleagues, and we've instituted widespread limits of liability. So E&O is a large risk exposure to us. We are in the business of giving advice, but on that \u2013 but I think we are entering this crisis with consistency and controlsin terms of how we render that advice. No, I think that the impact, generally in insurance, you have delayed impact geared up with renewal dates and that sort of thing. It's not immediate type of impact. I think we're going to feel headwind in parts of our business significant headwinds, both in the second and in the third quarter and I can't really say which one is likely to be more significant, when I look at the overall company and as we decide before, RIS to do reasonably okay, in this circumstances here. Mercer, we're thinking, it's going to be negative, most likely for the balance of the year. But overall, we think it's probably a modest decline for the year and there'll be proper pullbacks in OW. And in fact, at the end, we're very much focused not only in managing this crisis to the best we can, but also emerging from this crisis stronger than we otherwise would be. And so, we're not fighting every end for the second and third quarter. We're fighting for the next three years, and we're making sure that we're doing the right things now to ensure that we're positioned well. Yes, you you're spot on Elyse, and I would just in general, we're not really focused on margin, we're focused more on issues around revenue and earnings. And margin will be an outcome of what happens on the top line to a large extent. But you're right on and thinking that based upon what we've said about RIS, it's likely that RIS's margin hold up and may even improve a bit. And on the other hand, it's likely the Consulting margin based upon what we said is going to occur with their revenue outlook, are going to reduce. And overall companywide, I can't make a call right now in terms of that. I do know I love streak. And we've had 12 years in a row of margin expansion, and so we won't give that one or two easily. Yes, I think the way to look at it is, what's recurring revenue and what's more project related and that has more of an impact as to whether something falls in Consulting or something falls on the RSI side. On the RSI side there's a significant amount of recurring revenue, but parts of Mercer have a lot of recurring revenue as well. And so both of those recurring revenue pieces probably have a longer time horizon or a lag effect and so you will see an impact over the second and the third quarter as those businesses adjust. Areas which has non-recurring revenue, it could be done project related Consulting in Career within Mercer it could be most of Oliver Wyman is project related. Those will be faster decline, more immediate decline. And so you would be right in the second quarter in those parts of the business coming off. Next question please, operator. So thanks, Greg. I mean, it's a really important question. And it's multifaceted. But, let me talk about it a little bit from our perspective. I mean, I -- we did talk about both Marsh and I that our visibility into our outlook is uncertain, so making decisions with so much uncertainty about outlook isn't easy. But those decisions are best done with clear eyes and the collective judgment of a seasoned team. So, we've spent a lot of time surveying the horizon. And in our view, as I was just mentioning, we're in a resilient business. Yes, it hold up pretty well. Some parts of Consulting are going to see meaningful pullback, but we expect them to come back strong as the economy recovers and so we've got many different levers on the expense side at our disposal.We want to preserve flexibility and optionality for as long as we can. And we want to make decisions based on data scenario planning, stress testing, and we've got all kinds of capability within the firm in order to do that, and we recognize that there are different levers for different challenges. When we think about expense cuts, and our bonus pool it's primarily giving us levers to protect earnings, and by the way just as an aside, our bonus pool in 2019 was the largest in our history, so from that standpoint, bonus pools expense cuts are going to protect earnings as we go forward.To us salary reductions and things like dividend cuts are levers to protect liquidity it's kind of like survival mode stuff. And we would -- we took some other actions, we secured additional assets and liquidity early in the crisis. We believe that that's going to help us manage through most scenarios to the slowdown in collections impact our cash flow.And as we saw in the financial crisis, there was a slowdown in the collection cycle, but it is temporary, so solving that issue by reducing pays is an awfully blunt instrument, and it can have lasting implications, starting with the notion of battering trust with your colleague base by challenging them when they're in this difficult period and the snap back that all recurring cost, once pay is lifted back again it's just a couple of things that make it really problematic.Also you can't just implement that kind of thing easily this Consultation rules in most countries and so doing some sort of broad base pay reduction programs are very difficult. And the impact oftentimes will fall most heavily and unfairly on the U.S. population and so based upon our outlook today, levers like pay cuts or dividend cuts are not necessary. We track daily cash activity so we can get early warning signs and we can react quickly if those levers are warranted, but I can't emphasize enough that we are managing this period very closely. We have never been more connected as an organization, the leadership team and I meet every day and we are watching new business, expenses, exposure, pricing, cash flows obsessively as a leadership team and we are calm and we are clear-eyed in this crisis. Our intention is that in terms of levers to avoid being late and pulling a lever, but also avoid doing something now that is harmful, and later proved to be unnecessary. Sure, let me hand over to Mark who will walk you through not only our approach on accounts receivables, but what we're looking like on the debt side. So, Mark? Thank Mark. Next question, please. Well, I'm not going to comment on the potential merger between AON and Willis, I'll leave it to them to comment on it. We like our strategic positioning, we would not change position with any of our competitors. We believe that, we are set up very well, we're in the right countries, we've got the highest quality colleague base, we've got a client which would be the envy of any company in the world.And so we think that, we'll be able to grow substantially in the future based upon the fact that we're the leading provider of services around risk strategy and people and we like the way we're set up. I do know, we've learned an awful lot about integrating activities over the course of the last decade, we've done a number of acquisitions and, of course, JLT was the largest acquisition in our history. And we had a terrific year, a remarkable year in 2019, even though we were doing a lot of integration work and that is down to the quality of the executive team and the matching of culture that existed.They -- were the cultures were not identical, that's to be sure. But they're both high quality. They're both positive. They're both client focused. And so on that basis I really think that our fourth quarter demonstrate tick that box. JLT was a special acquisition for Marsh & McLennan and was the successful integration. We had 5% underlying revenue growth for the firm, but more specifically the places that really overlap the most with JLT is that Marsh at 5%, Guy Carpenter at 7%. And Mercer was 5%, but it was 8% underlying and health and so the quality of what we've been able to deliver, I mean, our adjusted operating income and almost $1.2 billion is a first quarter record for us.And so we're thrilled. We were set up for a wonderful year in 2020 in -- okay, so now, like the rest of the world we're dealing with the crisis, but it doesn't take away from the fact that we are a stronger, more capable, more creative, more connected firm than we've ever been before. Next question please. Yes, I mean, it's a great question because I think there are certain things that that are occurring which may actually last longer and maybe be permanent as we go forward. I mean things like flexible work arrangements may put our pressure on our real estate costs over time not in the short-term, but over time as an organization we have proven to ourselves and to our clients base that we can work from home, we can work remotely and do it effectively.And so there's an awful I mean, I absolutely believe that more agile environment, more digital are going to be a part of our future and that would be a real positive.Now in terms of expensive levers there's several that you can pull. I mean, I start from the idea that we have a very significant bonus pool as I mentioned before in the last 2019 our bonus pool was the largest level in the aggregate in our history as a company.And it's all here, net operating income, so we are team deep within the organization, is very aligned with shareholders and very aligned with the net operating income of the firm. And so it will be geared if the NOI is dropping while the bonus pool is not listed, and that's a wonderful lever, because it's variable, it's variable for a reason. And the other thing I would say is, we're a people business and while you may have less attrition in a recessionary environment, you still have attrition, and we thought in other recessions and we do not have a hiring freeze, in fact, we're hiring people every day, but we will control our hiring and we'll make sure that our executive team is very involved in making the decision that we want to make, but we'll manage our attrition that way and have some more control over that.Clearly, significant pullback in the use of temps for contractors and things like T&E have fallen away a lot of marketing spent. The things like conferences, meetings, events over time, all things that that we have as levers which have largely already been pulled to some extent and you can always go deeper there. But, we're comfortable in what in how we're set up. I mean, at the end, we said that we think that that our overall revenue might be down modestly as a company for the year. And if so then our overall EPS will be down modestly as well. But it might be slightly better than what our revenue would go. Thanks. Yes, hi. Thank you operator and I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to applaud the tireless dedication of our 76,000 colleagues worldwide and the important role they played supporting their colleagues, clients and local communities. Times like these tested true character of an organization and the strength of individuals. And what I've seen from MMC in the past few months has been nothing short of amazing. So thank you all and have a good day."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan\u2019s conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. Fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company\u2019s website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website.  During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today\u2019s earnings release.  I\u2019ll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. \nDan Glaser: Thanks Andrew. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I\u2019m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. John Doyle assumed his new role on January 1, and I am pleased to be working alongside him. During John\u2019s five years as CEO of Marsh, the business thrived under his leadership, experiencing accelerated revenue growth and record new business. He also inspired an even stronger culture of colleague engagement, inclusion and diversity. I look forward to unlocking the greater potential of Marsh McLennan together. I\u2019d also like to welcome Martin South and Dean Klisura, who assumed their new roles on January 1. Martin, who succeeded John as CEO of Marsh, has worked at Marsh for 27 years. Most recently Martin served as CEO of Marsh U.S. and Canada, where he produced a superior track record of growth. Dean Klisura, who succeeds Peter Hearn as CEO of Guy Carpenter, has been with Marsh McLennan for nearly 30 years. During his time at Marsh McLennan, Dean has served in executive leadership roles in Marsh\u2019s global specialties and placement before joining Guy Carpenter last year as President. Dean brings deep knowledge and broad industry relationships to his new role. I look forward to seeing Marsh and Guy Carpenter continue to thrive and grow under their leadership. These moves represent further examples of the extraordinary talent in Marsh McLennan and the seamless process we have built to manage orderly succession.  On behalf of the entire company, I want to express my deep gratitude to Peter Hearn for his exceptional leadership of Guy Carpenter. During Peter\u2019s tenure, Guy Carpenter achieved record financial performance and cultivated a culture where colleagues\u2019 professional success and personal fulfillment is a consistent priority. We look forward to the contributions he will continue to make as Vice Chair of Marsh McLennan. I\u2019d also like to thank Dominic Burke for his many contributions following our acquisition of JLT and wish him the best in his retirement. His leadership ensured our combination with JLT, the largest acquisition in our history, was a win for our clients, for our company, and for our colleagues.  2021 was a banner year for Marsh McLennan. We generated the strongest underlying revenue growth in over two decades with each of our businesses contributing meaningfully. Adjusted EPS growth was 24%, the highest in over two decades. We reported adjusted margin expansion for the 14th consecutive year. We invested meaningfully in our talent and capabilities, both organically and through attractive acquisitions, and we completed our deleveraging and resumed significant share repurchases.  Across the firm, 2021 was a year of extraordinary growth and achievement. Consistent with our philosophy of balancing near term financial results while also investing for the future, we capitalized on available opportunities to make significant investments. This is reflected in an organic increase of nearly 6,000 colleagues on a net basis, the highest level in our history. Our new colleagues not only add scale in client-facing roles but critical capabilities, the capacity to streamline operations, drive efficiencies, enhance client service outcomes, and expand the bandwidth of our market-facing operations.  We pursued attractive acquisitions. MMA broadened its geographic footprint in the key middle market segment with the addition of PayneWest. Oliver Wyman deepened our healthcare expertise and client service capabilities with the acquisition of Huron\u2019s life sciences business, and Marsh enhanced its market-leading position in India with an increase in the ownership stake in our Indian brokerage business from 49% to 92%. Portfolio optimization efforts continued as well, including the sale of Marsh\u2019s U.K. networks, Mercer\u2019s pension administration business in Brazil, and Mercer\u2019s U.S. associations business.  Across the organization, we took steps to accelerate productivity, gain efficiency, and enhance client experience with initiatives like Marsh\u2019s operational excellence program, our build-out of our India and other centers of excellence, and improving our technology and HR functions. 2021 was also a year in which we accelerated impact for clients through innovation in areas of pressing concern. Marsh McLennan provided thought leadership on key global issues in partnership with the World Economic Forum. For the 17th consecutive year, we collaborated in the production of the annual Global Risk Report, which was issued earlier this month. This year\u2019s report identifies climate action failure and extreme weather, the decline of social cohesion, infectious diseases, cyber security failure, mental health deterioration, and digital inequality among the top 10 risks facing society. Marsh McLennan\u2019s business is to help clients adapt to this evolving risk landscape and to plot a course through longer term secular challenges. In areas like cyber risk, climate resilience, digitization, diversity and inclusion, health societies and new ways of working, we\u2019ve brought forward creative solutions for our clients in 2021.  All of this is consistent with our legacy as an innovator for the past 150 years. Since the founding of our company in 1871, we have been at our clients\u2019 sides, finding opportunities and navigating uncertainty in the areas of risk, strategy and people. This approach has translated to significant value creation for our shareholders over time.  Since our IPO in 1962, our consolidated revenue has grown from $52 million to nearly $20 billion. Our adjusted EPS has increased from $0.02 per share to over $6 a share, and our headcount has risen from 3,000 colleagues to nearly 83,000 today. This translates to an average of 11% revenue growth, 10% adjusted EPS growth, and 6% headcount growth each year over this period, and we exit this first century and a half on a high note with terrific 2021 results. Now let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Rate increases continued to persist, reflecting losses, low returns, concerns about inflation, and a firming reinsurance market. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 13% year-over-year. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace.  Looking at pricing by line, the Marsh Market Index showed global property insurance was up 8%, global financial and professional lines were up 31% driven in part by cyber rates more than doubling in some geographies, and global casualty rates were up mid single digits on average. As a reminder, our index skews to large account business; however, small and middle market insurance rates continue to rise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. At the January renewals, capacity in most areas was available, although insurers pushed for price increases and in some cases coverage changes and tighter terms and conditions.  Turning to reinsurance, the January 1 reinsurance renewals reflected an evolving market. Capacity was adequate but reinsurers adjusted their risk appetite and pricing thresholds for certain sectors. This was in response to ongoing and emerging challenges such as the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, climate change, core inflation, social inflation, and underlying rate increases. The overall Guy Carpenter Global Property Catastrophe Rate-On-Line Index increased 10.8% with non-loss impacted clients being generally flat to up 7%, and loss-impacted up from 10% to over 30%. Marsh McLennan remains focused on helping our clients navigate challenging P&C rates in the evolving risk environment.  As we look ahead to 2022, we\u2019ve continued to see a good runway for growth given the outlook for above average GDP growth, sustained firm P&C pricing conditions, the inflationary impact on exposures, further opportunities from disruption in the brokerage sector, and the benefit of our recent organic investments. Taking a longer view, we believe demand for our solutions will remain strong given rising levels of complexity, volatility and uncertainty across the economic landscape supporting growth in years ahead. The global macroeconomic outlook remains positive even as there continues to be uncertainty due to the omicron variant, geopolitical pressures, supply chain challenges, inflation, and tightening monetary conditions.  In 2021, we broke out of the 3% to 5% underlying growth range of recent years. We believe we will sustain that momentum, driving mid single digit or better growth in 2022. We also expect to continue our track record of annual margin expansion and solid EPS growth.  With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on the quarter and other business trends.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks Dan, and good morning everyone. I\u2019m excited about the new role and the opportunity to work with Dan and the executive committee on Marsh McLennan\u2019s overall strategic and operational objectives. I\u2019m also excited for the leadership that Martin and Dean bring to Marsh and Guy Carpenter and to support them in their new roles. Since I joined Marsh McLennan almost six years ago, I continue to be impressed by the strength and depth of our talent and capabilities across the areas of risk, strategy and people. I\u2019ve also been impressed by the unwavering commitment of our colleagues to clients, to one another, and to the communities where we live and work. I am meeting with our colleagues, clients and business leaders to identify areas where we can have greater impact and accelerate growth. As Dan noted, our clients are operating in a volatile environment where emerging issues are creating both challenges and opportunities. Our expertise, scale, data and insights position us well to meet their needs. I believe we have meaningful runway to harness the power of Marsh McLennan across our businesses and find the intersections where we can have outsized client impact. Together, we can accelerate innovation, deliver critical solutions, and drive growth and value for shareholders. Marsh McLennan has tremendous momentum, as evidenced by our strong fourth quarter results. Highlights include continued double-digit underlying revenue growth and record adjusted operating income. We closed out a fantastic year with fourth quarter underlying revenue growth of 10%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and the longest stretch of double digit quarterly growth in over two decades. Looking at risk in insurance services, fourth quarter revenue was $3 billion, up 20% compared with the year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $557 million, while our adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points to 22.7%, reflecting investments made in the business. For the year, revenue was a record $12.1 billion with underlying growth of 10%. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 17% to a record $3 billion with a margin of 28.5%, up 50 basis points from the same period a year ago. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 22% compared with the year ago. Revenue growth was 9% on an underlying basis. U.S. and Canada delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth in the double digits for the third consecutive quarter at 11%. In international, underlying revenue growth was 7%. Latin America grew 14%, Asia Pacific was up 10%, and EMEA was up 5%. For the year, Marsh\u2019s revenue was $10.2 billion with underlying growth of 11%. U.S. and Canada underlying revenue growth was 13% and international was up 9%, the highest since we began reporting these regions in 2008. Guy Carpenter\u2019s fourth quarter revenue was $170 million, up 5% on an underlying basis. For the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.9 billion of revenue and 9% underlying growth.  In the consulting segment, revenue of $2.1 billion was a fourth quarter record, up 10% from a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis, the third consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $410 million. The adjusted operating margin was 20.2%, down 120 basis points versus a year ago, reflecting investments in the business. Consulting generated revenue of $7.8 billion for the year, representing underlying growth of 10%, the highest in nearly 15 years. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 19% to $1.5 billion, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 19.8%. Mercer\u2019s revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis. Career grew 15% on an underlying basis. This is the third straight quarter of double digit growth in the Career business. We are seeing strong demand for solutions linked to new ways of working, skills gaps, workforce transformation, and D&I issues like pay equity. Wealth increased 4% on an underlying basis, reflecting growth in both investment management and defined benefits. Our assets under management grew to $415 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 16% year-over-year, benefiting from net new inflows and market gains. Health underlying revenue growth was 4% in the quarter. For the year, revenue at Mercer was $5.3 billion, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis, the highest in over a decade. Oliver Wyman\u2019s revenue in the quarter was $722 million, an increase of 22% on an underlying basis. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth and reflects continued strong demand across geographies and practices. For the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $2.5 billion, an increase of 21% on an underlying basis. Overall, our strong fourth quarter and full year 2021 performance, as well as the investments we made in the year, sets us up for success in 2022 and beyond. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our initial outlook for 2022.\nMark McGivney: Thank you John, and good morning.  As Dan and John mentioned, our financial performance in the fourth quarter was strong, capping an outstanding year. We saw another quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth and meaningful earnings growth despite substantial investments that position us for continued success.  We generated GAAP EPS of $1.57 in the quarter and adjusted EPS of $1.36, up 14% versus a year ago. Operating income was $986 million and adjusted operating income was $905 million, a fourth quarter record. Our adjusted operating margin decreased 90 basis points in the fourth quarter to 20.4%, reflecting significant investments in the business. As we noted on our third quarter call, while we are excited about the future benefits these investments will deliver, they come with upfront cost we absorbed in the short term.  Our full year 2021 results were outstanding. Our adjusted EPS was $6.17, an increase of 24%, the highest is over two decades. Full year operating income was $4.3 billion and our adjusted operating income was also $4.3 billion. Finally, our adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points, marking our 14th consecutive year of margin expansion.  2021 was also a strong year for capital management. We completed our JLT-related deleveraging, enhanced our short term liquidity flexibility, and saw S&P, Moody\u2019s and Fitch restore our rating outlook to stable.  Through solid operating performance and our focus on working capital efficiency, we also exceeded our plans for capital deployment. This included a 15% increase in our dividend and $1.2 billion of share repurchases. This was the highest level of share repurchases since 2015, resulting in a meaningful reduction in our share count. John covered our business operating results, so I\u2019ll cover some of the other aspects of our performance and outlook. Adjusted corporate expense was $62 million in the fourth quarter. As we had expected, foreign exchange was a modest headwind. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.07 headwind in 2022, most of which will affect the first half of the year.  As we typically do on our fourth quarter calls, I will give a brief update on our global retirement plan.  Our other net benefit credit was $66 million on a GAAP basis in the quarter and $277 million for the full year. For 2022, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be about $255 million. Cash contributions to our global defined benefits plans were $129 million in 2021 compared with $143 million in 2020. We expect cash contributions in 2022 will be roughly $180 million. Investment income was $18 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and $14 million on an adjusted basis. For the full year 2021, our investment income was $61 million on a GAAP basis and $55 million on an adjusted basis.  Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $109 million. Based on our current forecasts, we expect a similar level of quarterly interest expense in 2022.  Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.6% compared with 24% in the fourth quarter last year, and reflected some discrete benefits we realized in the quarter. For the full year 2021, our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.6% compared to 24.4% for the full year 2020. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume and adjusted effective tax rate of around 25% for 2022.  Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $11 billion, including the proceeds from the $750 million of senior notes we issued in December. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem $500 million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature in January. Our next scheduled debt maturity isn\u2019t until March of 2023. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.2 billion and included $276 million for dividends, $494 million for acquisitions, and $425 million for share repurchases. For the year, uses of cash totaled $3.7 billion and included $1 billion for dividends, $1.1 billion for acquisitions, $1.2 billion for share repurchases, and $500 million for debt repayment.  Now that we\u2019ve completed our post-JLT deleveraging, we expect to return to our strategy of balanced capital management which supports our consistent focus on delivering solid performance in the near term while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We prioritize reinvestment in the business, both through organic investments and acquisitions.  In 2011, our revenues were $11.5 billion. Today we stand at nearly $20 billion and acquired revenues have accounted for roughly half of this growth. These acquisitions have added critical capabilities, talent, greater scale, expanded insights, and have driven significant value for clients and shareholders. We have consistently said that we prefer acquisitions to share repurchases. We view high quality acquisitions as better at creating value for shareholders and the company over the long term; however, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time and each year, we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count.  Looking ahead to 2022, the combination of our available cash and expected cash generation sets us up for another year of significant capital deployment. Based on our outlook today, we currently expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2022 across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As we look to 2022, we are well positioned given the strong momentum across our businesses as well as a largely favorable macroeconomic and P&C pricing backdrop. Based on our outlook today for the full year 2022, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth of mid single digits or better, margin expansion, and solid growth in adjusted EPS.  Keep in mind 2021 benefited from several items such as significant investment income and favorable discrete tax benefits that can fluctuate considerably from year to year. Also, as you consider the phasing of expenses in 2022, recognize that we made significant investments in talent in 2021 and don\u2019t begin the lap the full impact of these costs until the second half of the year. In summary, 2021 was a remarkable year, one in which all of our businesses delivered outstanding performance. We made substantial organic investments in the business, continued to execute on our acquisition strategy, completed our deleveraging, and resumed meaningful share repurchases. We are proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value they deliver to our clients and shareholders. We close the year on a high note and look forward to another year of strong performance in 2022. With that, I\u2019m happy to turn it back to Dan.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Mark. Operator, we\u2019re ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is specifically on RIS. If I look at the adjusted comp and benefits as a percent of revenue, it was pretty close to flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and I thought we would have seen a jump there just due to all the new hires that you\u2019ve been referencing. I guess my question is are the costs of the hires fully reflected and what perhaps would have been some of the offsets to keep that ratio flat, and then would you [indiscernible] upward pressure next year, meaning 2022, just given the hires and wage inflation in the system?\nDan Glaser: Thanks Elyse, it\u2019s a good question. I\u2019ll start with it. We\u2019ve said in the past how we look at our business and we manage comp and ben ratios, we actually consider it, and yes, not only in RIS for the total company. Our comp and ben ratio in 2021 is almost identical to the comp and ben ratio in 2020, and the big factor that\u2019s causing that is our revenue growth. Comp and ben is based--the ratios are based upon revenue growth, so the significant 10% revenue growth that we had in the year underlying plus the momentum we had, where we had 10% in the fourth quarter as well, gave us the room to absorb some of this hiring strategy and is one of the reasons why we point to 2021 as, in our view, our best year ever in 150 years. It\u2019s a year where we had tremendous financial performance and dramatic organic investments. But when you think about the hiring at RIS in general, John, do you have anything to add to that?\nJohn Doyle: Yes Elyse, what I would add is that the hiring was principally in three different areas. We\u2019ve tried to be quite strategic and wanted to focus on some of the disruption in the marketplace, so we made strategic hires at Marsh, Guy Carpenter, and Mercer. They have on-boarded, so you asked that question - they joined us mostly in the second half of the year, some on the first of January but largely in the second half of the year.  The second area of hiring, and this was mostly at Marsh, was around the operational excellence program that Dan spoke to. We\u2019re standing up centers of excellence in support of segregation of duties, moving mid back office work to lower cost environments leading to better client outcomes, better colleague experience, but it also will increase over time the capacity of our market-facing colleagues, so we\u2019re excited about that investment.  Then the third area was in early career. We paused in 2020 at the height of the pandemic, but we got back at it last year and on-boarded some early career colleagues. We\u2019re quite bullish on the hiring that we did. We\u2019re in a period now of on-boarding these colleagues and getting them to a productive state as quickly as possible.\nDan Glaser: So basically, Elyse, there\u2019s not a surge of expense coming with regard to the hiring. We\u2019ve been absorbing the additional expense as we go, and we\u2019re very happy that we were able to put up an adjusted EPS growth of 14% despite all the investments that we made in the second and third quarters.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks, then my follow-up would be on the other side of this, the revenue benefits that you guys can see from this incremental hiring. You guys laid out a mid single digit or better organic growth outlook for 2022. Can you help us think about the revenue benefit embedded within that from the hires that you brought on throughout 2021?\nDan Glaser: Yes, I think there\u2019s a few things. One, we\u2019re a capability company, we\u2019re a content company. When we\u2019re hiring somebody, it\u2019s not like, okay, what\u2019s your book of business and how much do we have to pay you and how long is it going to take you to pull that book. It\u2019s really what\u2019s your capability, what do you specialize in, what segments are you an expert in, and our focus over years has been on building that level of capability. Mark was stating that a bit in the script, where we\u2019ve gone from an $11.5 billion company to nearly $20 billion, and half of that is acquisition related - that\u2019s based upon capability, not somebody who can pull an account or two. The way I would look at it would be we do expect to grow more over time based upon our hiring strategy - that\u2019s absolutely true. We think it could take two or three years before people are operating at their optimum, whether that is a producer, a client-facing colleague, or somebody who\u2019s working in our service areas, that ultimately it takes some time for people to embed into a new company, a new culture, a new team, and so we give them that time. But when we talk about mid single digit or better for 2022, it\u2019s really looking at a number of factors - better global GDP growth than on average, strong P&C market, the organic hiring strategy that we\u2019ve done, and the capabilities that we\u2019ve built.  Our goal is now that we\u2019ve broke out of that 3% to 5% world, is to stay above that, and not just in 2022, it\u2019s beyond that and therefore we think that the hiring strategy has a lot to do with how we\u2019re going to perform in 2023 and 2024 as well. It is a permanent capability added to the firm. Next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. \nJimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. First I had a question on what you think about the acquisition pipeline, and just comment on competition for deals and how you\u2019re seeing multiples for potential targets. Obviously the public brokers are all trading at fairly high multiples versus historically. Are you seeing that in the private market as well, and just any comments on the pipeline.\nDan Glaser: Yes, I\u2019ll take that a little bit and then I\u2019ll hand off to John to talk about the business more broadly on the M&A front. I would say first of all, we referenced that we\u2019ve been around for 150 years and that the firm was founded via a combination of Donald McLennan and Henry Marsh and their agencies, so we have been active in acquisitions for 150 years and we intend to do so. Having said that, we have no budget on acquisitions. We\u2019re not particularly opportunistic, we\u2019re strategic. We build the pipeline over years and we\u2019re patient, so when you talk about things like competition around acquisitions, that\u2019s not us.  We\u2019re talking to companies that ultimately they have their ability to sell to anybody. They choose to want to be part of Marsh McLennan. They want to be part of the A-team and they believe that they can grow and they can offer their colleagues an opportunity to grow within Marsh McLennan which is beyond what they would be able to do with any other firm. When you hear about all this competition and froth, we\u2019re usually not engaged in that. There\u2019s many times where we don\u2019t even pick up the deck or the teaser, because there\u2019s a process. Now having said that, multiples over a number of years have increased. I don\u2019t think particularly in recent times they\u2019ve increased much, but it\u2019s fair to say that over the last couple of years, they\u2019re higher than they were five or six years ago, so you have to be really careful and make sure when you\u2019re going through a pro forma, because most of these acquisitions are private companies, to make sure that you understand how the P&L works, because the actual and the pro forma is often quite different.  I would say in general, our pipeline looks good and that we\u2019re not on any timetable or budget, and we\u2019ll just see how it goes. We will deploy that capital, so as Mark was saying, if we don\u2019t use it in acquisitions, which we favor, we will use it in share repurchase, and either way we probably have a reasonable amount of both acquisition and share repurchase. John, what can you see in the pipeline and what do you see in the market in general on the acquisition front?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. We remain active in the market, Jimmy, for sure. As Dan noted, we have a good, solid pipeline. We did seven deals in the fourth quarter, three at MMA, modest deals at MMA, we did three deals at Marsh as well, one quite small but India, of course, was quite important and very strategic for us. We also acquired an Affinity broker in France, so we\u2019re excited about what that can do for our business there, and then of course we did Huron, as Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks earlier. We\u2019re looking for strong performing businesses that are well led, that make us better in some way - they either fit a market that we\u2019re not serving at the moment or particularly strong in, or in a geography maybe that we don\u2019t cover all that well. An example of that was last year with the acquisition of PayneWest, which was a high performing business, outstanding leadership team, performing well, and they\u2019re just a terrific cultural fit and it fit perfectly for us in the upper northwest of MMA\u2019s operations here in the United States. We\u2019ll continue to be active, and maybe one thing just to add on the multiple side, we\u2019ve seen some MGAs that I think--certainly some very, very high multiples in the MGA market. I think many of them are kind of trading under the insuretech label and so driving some interest there. We haven\u2019t been particularly active in that market. We keep a close eye on it and we serve many of them as clients through Guy Carpenter, but outside of that we\u2019ve earned a terrific reputation in the market, and so we end up with good, high quality conversations before things go to market. \nDan Glaser: Just one other thing, just adding--you know, OW has been a tremendous acquisition for the company from back to, whenever - 2003 or 2004. It\u2019s now a $2.5 billion management consulting company with all kinds of capability, and it was good to see OW out there acquiring Huron\u2019s life sciences business, which again adds capability to the firm and will help us grow more into the future. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up?\nJimmy Bhullar: Yes, and it\u2019s partly on OW. Overall, if you think about organic growth, obviously it\u2019s benefited in a number of your businesses from the economic recovery, and especially at Oliver Wyman. But with omicron picking up in December and into January, should we assume a little bit of an impact on some of your businesses or not much across the enterprise?\nDan Glaser: I\u2019ll hand off to both Nick and Martine to give a little comment about whether they\u2019re seeing an omicron impact. My overall feeling is the world has become pretty resilient and has learned to adapt, and so therefore GDP projections, while they\u2019ve come down a bit in our major countries, they\u2019re still relatively strong compared to four or five years ago. But why don\u2019t we do to you first, Nick, and then to Martine about whether you\u2019re seeing any impact of omicron on your business.\nNick Studer: Thanks very much Dan. Thanks Jimmy for the question. You\u2019re right - our business does tend to prosper when the economy is really healthy, but I think we also see that when our clients\u2019 questions change, they often need more support, and the short answer is we\u2019re not seeing any slowdown in the business in the first quarter. Our pipeline is strong, and really over the last 12 months and still well into the first quarter, we\u2019re optimistic because the growth is very broad-based across almost every single one of our industry areas and the vast majority of our capabilities, whether it\u2019s payments or private equity, whether it\u2019s climate or digital, whether it\u2019s growth strategy or cost management and restructuring. It is broad-based growth, and we\u2019re not seeing an omicron effect. \nDan Glaser: Thanks. Martine?\nMartine Ferland: Yes, very similarly to Nick--and thanks for the question, Jimmy, I will focus a bit on Career here because that\u2019s the part of Mercer that is more connected to the economy. Similarly, we\u2019ve come into the year with good momentum, strong sales, and what we\u2019ve been busy with for the last part of \u201921 has not gone away - if anything, it\u2019s continuing to accelerate, whether it\u2019s a talent war, labor shortage, skill gaps, redefining the way that we work, the return to work that has been in and out, in and out in many countries. That\u2019s keeping the team busy. For now, we\u2019re not seeing much of an impact, and if anything, commenting on health a little bit, that has also been impacted. We have seen enrolled lives come up, we don\u2019t see this going away, at least not in the near future, and some medical inflation returning as well, impacting premiums because the non-COVID medical treatment has picked up. We might see a little bit of a gap there due to omicron, but I don\u2019t think it will last.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research.\nMike Zaremski: Great, good morning. Maybe switching gears to the property and casualty insurance marketplace, I think in the comments in the outlook, you talked about a strong P&C market. From the prepared remarks, I think you cited the Marsh index, it seems like pricing had decelerated a couple points but still at kind of high absolute levels. Are you seeing a deceleration in pricing amongst your clients?\nDan Glaser: John, you want to take that?\nJohn Doyle: Sure Mike. As Dan noted, it was the 17th consecutive quarter of price increases, so this market obviously has had some legs, at least compared to the time that I\u2019ve been in it, which is a long time. There was some moderation in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. I think cyber is probably the biggest outlier in all this. Maybe Mark and Dean can talk about their observations in a second, but the underwriting community in cyber of course is still reacting to the frequency and severity of ransomware claims, and they\u2019re worried about systemic events as well but I think the market reaction right now is more driven by ransomware losses. The market remains challenging for our clients, and broadly speaking the underwriting community is worried about property cat losses, the impact of inflation on loss cost, and as I mentioned earlier, cyber related claims. Martin, you want to share some thoughts about the market?\nMartin South: Yes John, thank you. As you said, there\u2019s a slight deceleration of the global rate index, it\u2019s down by a couple of points from 15 to 13. You\u2019ve seen deceleration in most of the geographies. An interesting outlier in Latin America, where rate increases continue to be strong. If I turn to cat lines and more cat-exposed areas, still strength there. [Indiscernible] casualty, which is still showing some deceleration, there\u2019s still strength in the umbrella area in the property book. Those that are multi-line and multilayer insurers are double what you see for single carriers, so where there are cat exposures, you\u2019re still seeing price increases, and that\u2019s a trend you\u2019re seeing across the board. As you said, John, on cyber, very strong, almost double in Europe and over 100% in North America for cyber, so still strength.\nJohn Doyle: Got it, thanks Martin. Dean, we just had a big reinsurance renewal January 1. What\u2019s happening in the reinsurance market?\nDean Klisura: Thank you John. As discussed, the reinsurance market at January 1, the renewal was very late; however, overall placements were very orderly and everything got completed. Clearly reinsurers differentiated among individual risks. Pricing has been bifurcated between loss impacted and non-loss impacted accounts. As Dan mentioned earlier, the Guy Carpenter Global Property Catastrophe Rate-On-Line Index increased to 10.8%, the largest increase in 15 years. Capacity is ample across most lines of business but certainly more constrained in the catastrophe property market that John mentioned, the cyber market, particularly the cyber aggregate market and certainly the retrocession market. \nJohn Doyle: Got it, thank you Dean. Another question, Mike?\nMike Zaremski: Yes, a quick follow-up. This might be for Mark McGivney. If short term interest rates do indeed move higher over the coming year or years, would Marsh get a slight benefit from fiduciary investment income levels?\nDan Glaser: Mark, do you want to handle that?\nMark McGivney: Yes. Mike, we would. Fiduciary interest income in 2021, I hope bottomed out at $15 million. If you look back just two years ago, it was $105 million, so the pandemic and the impact on short term rates really took the wind out of that line item. If rates climb, that certainly is a source of opportunity for us. Just keep in mind as you think about 2022, it\u2019s a function of not only how rates move, when they move and where they move. We\u2019ve got fiduciary balances outside of the U.S., obviously, but certainly if rates go up over the next couple of years, that\u2019s opportunity for us.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you very much, good morning. My first question goes back to, I think, some of the comments you made regarding the previous question, which was around wage inflation and its potential impact on revenues, both in RIS and in consulting. How do you see that playing out? Is it more of a headwind, more of a tailwind for 2022?\nDan Glaser: Well, I would say wage inflation in general would--well, let\u2019s take it broader. Inflation in general would be a bit of a tailwind for us because when we look at past cycles, Marsh McLennan tends to do a bit better in inflationary periods than what preceded them, so writ large, probably a mild benefit because of exposure unit growth, principally. Now wage inflation in particular, it\u2019s hard to see how that would be more than a negative for our clients and for ourselves, but when you think about it, some of the rating factors that are utilized to figure out, say, some casualty and some medical benefits, etc., are based upon headcount and also sometimes on payroll, so if payroll is rising, that means the exposure unit\u2019s rising, so it\u2019s pretty moderate.  Now, we\u2019re very wary, of course, like everybody else, about wage inflation, but I start from the basis of what I was saying to Elyse earlier - our comp and ben ratios have been very consistent over time. We have shared the growth of the company with our colleagues, and it\u2019s not a one-year wonder, it\u2019s for multiple years. It\u2019s not all about pay, it\u2019s also about what kind of company you are, what kind of caring employer, how you treat your colleagues, etc., and so we create an environment at Marsh McLennan we really strive to make it a great place to work, and we\u2019ll continue to do that. While we\u2019re watchful about wage inflation, we haven\u2019t really seen much of that, and it would be masked in any event by our variable comp, which is based upon net operating income, so that risen pretty significantly over a number of years.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you for the comments. Then a follow-up on cyber - just curious as to how clients view this line item. Is this a non-discretionary item for most of them? What I\u2019m trying to get at is with no real slowdown in the rate increases we\u2019re seeing there, is there risk that clients ultimately start buying down or not buying cyber coverage?\nDan Glaser: John?\nJohn Doyle: Look, at some point would that become the case? Sure, that\u2019s a potential, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re running into that risk at the moment. And by the way, is it discretionary? Yes, it\u2019s discretionary. I would say about 50% of our clients in the United States, only 50% of them buy standalone cyber coverage and about 25% of our clients outside the United States buy standalone cyber coverage. The market is finding an equilibrium, it\u2019s sorting out how to deal with ransomware. When Martin talked about the price increase, that doesn\u2019t all manifest itself in premium growth or increased premiums for our clients. Underwriters are insisting on higher attachment points, co-insurance for ransomware, sub-limits for example - that all gets factored into the rate change that we talk about, so we work with our clients and we work with the markets to try to find the best way to finance the risk. It\u2019s not just financing risk after the fact, of course. We\u2019re actively working across the entire firm - Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Oliver Wyman, Mercer to help our clients better understand the risk and take steps to mitigate the risk upfront, but also the impact of an event once it happens. \nDan Glaser: Yes, so Yiron, cyber is going to be a tremendous growth market for us. We\u2019re nowhere close to saturation, where clients will start not buying cyber because of the price. You have to bear in mind that this is a significant governance issue for most boards - it\u2019s like an ESG issue, and so you\u2019d have to be a pretty brave company to decide to not buy cyber if it\u2019s presented to you at a board level.  Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. I wanted to start with the question on risk and insurance services. We\u2019ve had other operating expenses up $139 million on a year-over-year basis, and I\u2019m trying to figure out how much of that was adjusted out. Maybe just give a sense of the underlying increase in other operating expenses. \nDan Glaser: Yes, if you look at all other expenses other than comp and ben for the year, all other expenses in 2021 were up 1%, and that\u2019s across the firm, so really this has been--you know, if you look at our underlying expense growth for the year, comp and ben is 85% of that growth and variable comp and ben is two-thirds of that 85%, so this is really about the opportunity we saw and the strategy we put in place to increase the size of the firm through a concerted effort around organic hiring. It doesn\u2019t have to do with all expenses. It\u2019s fair to say that certain all other expenses that are more discretionary in the fourth quarter, like T&E and meetings, marketing, increased over 2020\u2019s fourth quarter, but still relative to the entire year, they were only up 1%.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. That\u2019s fantastic. Then a question for Dean - I think you had commented--I\u2019m going to get the quote wrong, but you said that basically reinsurance placements got done at 1/1. We certainly heard some commentary on difficulty accessing aggregate programs and retro. Was just hoping you could talk about those components specifically.\nDan Glaser: Dean?\nDean Klisura: Sure. Those components of the market were clearly challenging at 1/1. I mentioned cyber aggregates programs - you know, reinsurers definitely pulled back some capacity there around cyber aggregate capacity. Just like property catastrophe, capacity was certainly pulled back by key reinsurers, and probably the most challenging part of the market on 1/1 was the retrocession market, where we saw several ILS funds based in Bermuda really kind of pull back. You had investors pulling capital out, redemption, catastrophic losses from climate change and other cat losses impacting their results, so clearly that was the most challenging part of the market on the January 1 renewal.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Dean. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Dan, you spoke about absorbing some of the expenses in 2021 just due to the hiring. Could you just help us think about how much the hiring activity dragged or impacted margins in 2021, because I\u2019m thinking that as we go through 2022 and those producers start to ramp up, that could be less of a drag, so I\u2019m just trying to quantify that just as I think about comparing margins in \u201922 versus \u201921.\nDan Glaser: Sure. Certainly the hiring will be less of a drag in 2022, particularly in the back half of the year when we start to lap the decisions we\u2019ve made and the on-boarding that we\u2019ve done. We don\u2019t overly focus on margins within the company, we focus on growing the firm and earnings, so both underlying revenue and earnings. Margins are an outcome of how we run the business. Revenue growth exceeds expense growth in almost every quarter and certainly every year, as it\u2019s done for 14 years. We expect to grow margins in 2022 and we think that our margins should be viewed over long stretches of time, certainly not a quarter or two. We\u2019re very happy with 2021 because, as I was mentioning earlier, we had a tremendous financial performance and we invested heavily in the business, and when I say heavily, invested heavily--more heavily in hiring in 2021 than in any time in our 150 year history. It positions us very well, and we look at 2021 - we grew margins in 2021 despite all of the organic investments that we\u2019ve made. Our margin was up 70 BPs in RIS--or 70 BPs overall, 50 in RIS, and consulting was up 100 BPs, so overall I think we\u2019re ticking the box on margin. We expect margin expansion, we expect strong adjusted EPS growth, and we expect to grow mid single digits or higher, so 2022 for us is going to be another terrific year. Now, it\u2019s pretty hard to have two banner years in a row. I\u2019m not going to sit here and say it\u2019s not a tough comp when you grow adjusted EPS 24%, but having said that, we expect strong adjusted EPS growth in 2022.\nDavid Motemaden: Great, that makes sense. Then maybe just on that, obviously 6,000 producers added in 2021--\nDan Glaser: Well, I kind of wish that they were 6,000 producers there, David, but they\u2019re not 6,000 producers. It is a portion of that is production-related talent, but it also gave us the opportunity to build service capability. There\u2019s an old adage about more sales doesn\u2019t equal better service, better service always equals more sales, so we invested in service as much as we did in sales.\nDavid Motemaden: Right, thanks for that clarification. I guess you did mention there is disruption still and opportunities still. I\u2019m just wondering on the hiring pipeline, I\u2019m assuming has this disruption started to stabilize maybe a little bit less, or are you still seeing the opportunities to add talent?\nDan Glaser: Well, I\u2019m going to hand off to John, but I\u2019ll start by just saying this is a professional service firm issue, not an issue particularly within RIS. On balance, we have smart, high talent, creative, hard-working people, as does a lot of professional services firms. Each of our employees, each of our colleagues has all kinds of opportunities. Our job is to make us an ideal place for them to give their careers, so there is a--it almost became a clich\u00e9 in terms of the war for talent when you go back four years ago, five years ago. It\u2019s not a clich\u00e9 anymore - there is a significant amount of talent movement that occurred at the latter stages of the pandemic, and that probably will continue. We\u2019re in that, so it\u2019s not necessarily disruption because of issues within the RIS segment, there\u2019s disruption in society around where people choose to work and how they work. John, can you add to that?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. David, we have an excellent brand as an employer, I think as evidenced by the amount of talent we were able to attract last year. We\u2019ve got purpose-driven culture, our colleagues are highly engaged, we do impactful work, we\u2019re a collaborative place to work. You feel like you\u2019re part of a team when you work at Marsh McLennan. It\u2019s also a place where you can learn and develop, as Dan noted before, and we pay well too. Pay is not everything, of course, but it\u2019s important.  We took the opportunity last year to strengthen the team. I talked about the three different areas earlier - strat hires, service centers, and in early career. I think we started 2021 with the best team on the field, and we\u2019re starting 2022 even stronger. Our focus is on on-boarding and getting those colleagues productive, but we will be active in the market and take advantage of our brand at times, but we won\u2019t have the same level of organic hiring in 2022. \nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan for any closing remarks.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. I thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning.  2021 may have been our best ever. It was a year of tremendous financial performance and dramatic organic investment. Our competitive position has never been stronger and we enhanced our leading position this year.  People use the term, fortress balance sheet, to describe the strength of their firm. We are an ideas company, a people business, and I would say that Marsh McLennan has a fortress talent base that got even stronger this year. I want to thank our 83,000 colleagues for their commitment, hard work and dedication to Marsh McLennan.  Thank you all very much, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.",

You had investors pulling capital out, redemption, catastrophic losses from climate change and other cat losses impacting their results, so clearly that was the most challenging part of the market on the January 1 renewal."

            "name": "Dan Glaser",
            "content": "Thanks Andrew. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. John Doyle assumed his new role on January 1, and I am pleased to be working alongside him. During John's five years as CEO of Marsh, the business thrived under his leadership, experiencing accelerated revenue growth and record new business. He also inspired an even stronger culture of colleague engagement, inclusion and diversity. I look forward to unlocking the greater potential of Marsh McLennan together. I'd also like to welcome Martin South and Dean Klisura, who assumed their new roles on January 1. Martin, who succeeded John as CEO of Marsh, has worked at Marsh for 27 years. Most recently Martin served as CEO of Marsh U.S. and Canada, where he produced a superior track record of growth. Dean Klisura, who succeeds Peter Hearn as CEO of Guy Carpenter, has been with Marsh McLennan for nearly 30 years. During his time at Marsh McLennan, Dean has served in executive leadership roles in Marsh's global specialties and placement before joining Guy Carpenter last year as President. Dean brings deep knowledge and broad industry relationships to his new role. I look forward to seeing Marsh and Guy Carpenter continue to thrive and grow under their leadership. These moves represent further examples of the extraordinary talent in Marsh McLennan and the seamless process we have built to manage orderly succession.  On behalf of the entire company, I want to express my deep gratitude to Peter Hearn for his exceptional leadership of Guy Carpenter. During Peter's tenure, Guy Carpenter achieved record financial performance and cultivated a culture where colleagues' professional success and personal fulfillment is a consistent priority. We look forward to the contributions he will continue to make as Vice Chair of Marsh McLennan. I'd also like to thank Dominic Burke for his many contributions following our acquisition of JLT and wish him the best in his retirement. His leadership ensured our combination with JLT, the largest acquisition in our history, was a win for our clients, for our company, and for our colleagues.  2021 was a banner year for Marsh McLennan. We generated the strongest underlying revenue growth in over two decades with each of our businesses contributing meaningfully. Adjusted EPS growth was 24%, the highest in over two decades. We reported adjusted margin expansion for the 14th consecutive year. We invested meaningfully in our talent and capabilities, both organically and through attractive acquisitions, and we completed our deleveraging and resumed significant share repurchases.  Across the firm, 2021 was a year of extraordinary growth and achievement. Consistent with our philosophy of balancing near term financial results while also investing for the future, we capitalized on available opportunities to make significant investments. This is reflected in an organic increase of nearly 6,000 colleagues on a net basis, the highest level in our history. Our new colleagues not only add scale in client-facing roles but critical capabilities, the capacity to streamline operations, drive efficiencies, enhance client service outcomes, and expand the bandwidth of our market-facing operations.  We pursued attractive acquisitions. MMA broadened its geographic footprint in the key middle market segment with the addition of PayneWest. Oliver Wyman deepened our healthcare expertise and client service capabilities with the acquisition of Huron's life sciences business, and Marsh enhanced its market-leading position in India with an increase in the ownership stake in our Indian brokerage business from 49% to 92%. Portfolio optimization efforts continued as well, including the sale of Marsh's U.K. networks, Mercer's pension administration business in Brazil, and Mercer's U.S. associations business.  Across the organization, we took steps to accelerate productivity, gain efficiency, and enhance client experience with initiatives like Marsh's operational excellence program, our build-out of our India and other centers of excellence, and improving our technology and HR functions. 2021 was also a year in which we accelerated impact for clients through innovation in areas of pressing concern. Marsh McLennan provided thought leadership on key global issues in partnership with the World Economic Forum. For the 17th consecutive year, we collaborated in the production of the annual Global Risk Report, which was issued earlier this month. This year's report identifies climate action failure and extreme weather, the decline of social cohesion, infectious diseases, cyber security failure, mental health deterioration, and digital inequality among the top 10 risks facing society. Marsh McLennan's business is to help clients adapt to this evolving risk landscape and to plot a course through longer term secular challenges. In areas like cyber risk, climate resilience, digitization, diversity and inclusion, health societies and new ways of working, we've brought forward creative solutions for our clients in 2021.  All of this is consistent with our legacy as an innovator for the past 150 years. Since the founding of our company in 1871, we have been at our clients' sides, finding opportunities and navigating uncertainty in the areas of risk, strategy and people. This approach has translated to significant value creation for our shareholders over time.  Since our IPO in 1962, our consolidated revenue has grown from $52 million to nearly $20 billion. Our adjusted EPS has increased from $0.02 per share to over $6 a share, and our headcount has risen from 3,000 colleagues to nearly 83,000 today. This translates to an average of 11% revenue growth, 10% adjusted EPS growth, and 6% headcount growth each year over this period, and we exit this first century and a half on a high note with terrific 2021 results. Now let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Rate increases continued to persist, reflecting losses, low returns, concerns about inflation, and a firming reinsurance market. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 13% year-over-year. This marks the 17th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace.  Looking at pricing by line, the Marsh Market Index showed global property insurance was up 8%, global financial and professional lines were up 31% driven in part by cyber rates more than doubling in some geographies, and global casualty rates were up mid single digits on average. As a reminder, our index skews to large account business; however, small and middle market insurance rates continue to rise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. At the January renewals, capacity in most areas was available, although insurers pushed for price increases and in some cases coverage changes and tighter terms and conditions.  Turning to reinsurance, the January 1 reinsurance renewals reflected an evolving market. Capacity was adequate but reinsurers adjusted their risk appetite and pricing thresholds for certain sectors. This was in response to ongoing and emerging challenges such as the frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, climate change, core inflation, social inflation, and underlying rate increases. The overall Guy Carpenter Global Property Catastrophe Rate-On-Line Index increased 10.8% with non-loss impacted clients being generally flat to up 7%, and loss-impacted up from 10% to over 30%. Marsh McLennan remains focused on helping our clients navigate challenging P&C rates in the evolving risk environment.  As we look ahead to 2022, we've continued to see a good runway for growth given the outlook for above average GDP growth, sustained firm P&C pricing conditions, the inflationary impact on exposures, further opportunities from disruption in the brokerage sector, and the benefit of our recent organic investments. Taking a longer view, we believe demand for our solutions will remain strong given rising levels of complexity, volatility and uncertainty across the economic landscape supporting growth in years ahead. The global macroeconomic outlook remains positive even as there continues to be uncertainty due to the omicron variant, geopolitical pressures, supply chain challenges, inflation, and tightening monetary conditions.  In 2021, we broke out of the 3% to 5% underlying growth range of recent years. We believe we will sustain that momentum, driving mid single digit or better growth in 2022. We also expect to continue our track record of annual margin expansion and solid EPS growth.  With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on the quarter and other business trends. Thanks Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A. Thanks Elyse, it's a good question. I'll start with it. We've said in the past how we look at our business and we manage comp and ben ratios, we actually consider it, and yes, not only in RIS for the total company. Our comp and ben ratio in 2021 is almost identical to the comp and ben ratio in 2020, and the big factor that's causing that is our revenue growth. Comp and ben is based--the ratios are based upon revenue growth, so the significant 10% revenue growth that we had in the year underlying plus the momentum we had, where we had 10% in the fourth quarter as well, gave us the room to absorb some of this hiring strategy and is one of the reasons why we point to 2021 as, in our view, our best year ever in 150 years. It's a year where we had tremendous financial performance and dramatic organic investments. But when you think about the hiring at RIS in general, John, do you have anything to add to that? So basically, Elyse, there's not a surge of expense coming with regard to the hiring. We've been absorbing the additional expense as we go, and we're very happy that we were able to put up an adjusted EPS growth of 14% despite all the investments that we made in the second and third quarters. Yes, I think there's a few things. One, we're a capability company, we're a content company. When we're hiring somebody, it's not like, okay, what's your book of business and how much do we have to pay you and how long is it going to take you to pull that book. It's really what's your capability, what do you specialize in, what segments are you an expert in, and our focus over years has been on building that level of capability. Mark was stating that a bit in the script, where we've gone from an $11.5 billion company to nearly $20 billion, and half of that is acquisition related - that's based upon capability, not somebody who can pull an account or two. The way I would look at it would be we do expect to grow more over time based upon our hiring strategy - that's absolutely true. We think it could take two or three years before people are operating at their optimum, whether that is a producer, a client-facing colleague, or somebody who's working in our service areas, that ultimately it takes some time for people to embed into a new company, a new culture, a new team, and so we give them that time. But when we talk about mid single digit or better for 2022, it's really looking at a number of factors - better global GDP growth than on average, strong P&C market, the organic hiring strategy that we've done, and the capabilities that we've built.  Our goal is now that we've broke out of that 3% to 5% world, is to stay above that, and not just in 2022, it's beyond that and therefore we think that the hiring strategy has a lot to do with how we're going to perform in 2023 and 2024 as well. It is a permanent capability added to the firm. Next question, please? Yes, I'll take that a little bit and then I'll hand off to John to talk about the business more broadly on the M&A front. I would say first of all, we referenced that we've been around for 150 years and that the firm was founded via a combination of Donald McLennan and Henry Marsh and their agencies, so we have been active in acquisitions for 150 years and we intend to do so. Having said that, we have no budget on acquisitions. We're not particularly opportunistic, we're strategic. We build the pipeline over years and we're patient, so when you talk about things like competition around acquisitions, that's not us.  We're talking to companies that ultimately they have their ability to sell to anybody. They choose to want to be part of Marsh McLennan. They want to be part of the A-team and they believe that they can grow and they can offer their colleagues an opportunity to grow within Marsh McLennan which is beyond what they would be able to do with any other firm. When you hear about all this competition and froth, we're usually not engaged in that. There's many times where we don't even pick up the deck or the teaser, because there's a process. Now having said that, multiples over a number of years have increased. I don't think particularly in recent times they've increased much, but it's fair to say that over the last couple of years, they're higher than they were five or six years ago, so you have to be really careful and make sure when you're going through a pro forma, because most of these acquisitions are private companies, to make sure that you understand how the P&L works, because the actual and the pro forma is often quite different.  I would say in general, our pipeline looks good and that we're not on any timetable or budget, and we'll just see how it goes. We will deploy that capital, so as Mark was saying, if we don't use it in acquisitions, which we favor, we will use it in share repurchase, and either way we probably have a reasonable amount of both acquisition and share repurchase. John, what can you see in the pipeline and what do you see in the market in general on the acquisition front? Just one other thing, just adding--you know, OW has been a tremendous acquisition for the company from back to, whenever - 2003 or 2004. It's now a $2.5 billion management consulting company with all kinds of capability, and it was good to see OW out there acquiring Huron's life sciences business, which again adds capability to the firm and will help us grow more into the future. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up? I'll hand off to both Nick and Martine to give a little comment about whether they're seeing an omicron impact. My overall feeling is the world has become pretty resilient and has learned to adapt, and so therefore GDP projections, while they've come down a bit in our major countries, they're still relatively strong compared to four or five years ago. But why don't we do to you first, Nick, and then to Martine about whether you're seeing any impact of omicron on your business. Thanks. Martine? Thank you. Next question, please. John, you want to take that? Mark, do you want to handle that? Thank you. Next question, please. Well, I would say wage inflation in general would--well, let's take it broader. Inflation in general would be a bit of a tailwind for us because when we look at past cycles, Marsh McLennan tends to do a bit better in inflationary periods than what preceded them, so writ large, probably a mild benefit because of exposure unit growth, principally. Now wage inflation in particular, it's hard to see how that would be more than a negative for our clients and for ourselves, but when you think about it, some of the rating factors that are utilized to figure out, say, some casualty and some medical benefits, etc., are based upon headcount and also sometimes on payroll, so if payroll is rising, that means the exposure unit's rising, so it's pretty moderate.  Now, we're very wary, of course, like everybody else, about wage inflation, but I start from the basis of what I was saying to Elyse earlier - our comp and ben ratios have been very consistent over time. We have shared the growth of the company with our colleagues, and it's not a one-year wonder, it's for multiple years. It's not all about pay, it's also about what kind of company you are, what kind of caring employer, how you treat your colleagues, etc., and so we create an environment at Marsh McLennan we really strive to make it a great place to work, and we'll continue to do that. While we're watchful about wage inflation, we haven't really seen much of that, and it would be masked in any event by our variable comp, which is based upon net operating income, so that risen pretty significantly over a number of years. John? Yes, so Yiron, cyber is going to be a tremendous growth market for us. We're nowhere close to saturation, where clients will start not buying cyber because of the price. You have to bear in mind that this is a significant governance issue for most boards - it's like an ESG issue, and so you'd have to be a pretty brave company to decide to not buy cyber if it's presented to you at a board level.  Next question, please. Yes, if you look at all other expenses other than comp and ben for the year, all other expenses in 2021 were up 1%, and that's across the firm, so really this has been--you know, if you look at our underlying expense growth for the year, comp and ben is 85% of that growth and variable comp and ben is two-thirds of that 85%, so this is really about the opportunity we saw and the strategy we put in place to increase the size of the firm through a concerted effort around organic hiring. It doesn't have to do with all expenses. It's fair to say that certain all other expenses that are more discretionary in the fourth quarter, like T&E and meetings, marketing, increased over 2020's fourth quarter, but still relative to the entire year, they were only up 1%. Dean? Thanks Dean. Next question, please. Sure. Certainly the hiring will be less of a drag in 2022, particularly in the back half of the year when we start to lap the decisions we've made and the on-boarding that we've done. We don't overly focus on margins within the company, we focus on growing the firm and earnings, so both underlying revenue and earnings. Margins are an outcome of how we run the business. Revenue growth exceeds expense growth in almost every quarter and certainly every year, as it's done for 14 years. We expect to grow margins in 2022 and we think that our margins should be viewed over long stretches of time, certainly not a quarter or two. We're very happy with 2021 because, as I was mentioning earlier, we had a tremendous financial performance and we invested heavily in the business, and when I say heavily, invested heavily--more heavily in hiring in 2021 than in any time in our 150 year history. It positions us very well, and we look at 2021 - we grew margins in 2021 despite all of the organic investments that we've made. Our margin was up 70 BPs in RIS--or 70 BPs overall, 50 in RIS, and consulting was up 100 BPs, so overall I think we're ticking the box on margin. We expect margin expansion, we expect strong adjusted EPS growth, and we expect to grow mid single digits or higher, so 2022 for us is going to be another terrific year. Now, it's pretty hard to have two banner years in a row. I'm not going to sit here and say it's not a tough comp when you grow adjusted EPS 24%, but having said that, we expect strong adjusted EPS growth in 2022. Well, I kind of wish that they were 6,000 producers there, David, but they're not 6,000 producers. It is a portion of that is production-related talent, but it also gave us the opportunity to build service capability. There's an old adage about more sales doesn't equal better service, better service always equals more sales, so we invested in service as much as we did in sales. Well, I'm going to hand off to John, but I'll start by just saying this is a professional service firm issue, not an issue particularly within RIS. On balance, we have smart, high talent, creative, hard-working people, as does a lot of professional services firms. Each of our employees, each of our colleagues has all kinds of opportunities. Our job is to make us an ideal place for them to give their careers, so there is a--it almost became a cliche\u0301 in terms of the war for talent when you go back four years ago, five years ago. It's not a cliche\u0301 anymore - there is a significant amount of talent movement that occurred at the latter stages of the pandemic, and that probably will continue. We're in that, so it's not necessarily disruption because of issues within the RIS segment, there's disruption in society around where people choose to work and how they work. John, can you add to that? Thank you. I thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning.  2021 may have been our best ever. It was a year of tremendous financial performance and dramatic organic investment. Our competitive position has never been stronger and we enhanced our leading position this year.  People use the term, fortress balance sheet, to describe the strength of their firm. We are an ideas company, a people business, and I would say that Marsh McLennan has a fortress talent base that got even stronger this year. I want to thank our 83,000 colleagues for their commitment, hard work and dedication to Marsh McLennan.  Thank you all very much, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter."

            "name": "John Doyle",
            "content": "Thanks Dan, and good morning everyone. I'm excited about the new role and the opportunity to work with Dan and the executive committee on Marsh McLennan's overall strategic and operational objectives. I'm also excited for the leadership that Martin and Dean bring to Marsh and Guy Carpenter and to support them in their new roles. Since I joined Marsh McLennan almost six years ago, I continue to be impressed by the strength and depth of our talent and capabilities across the areas of risk, strategy and people. I've also been impressed by the unwavering commitment of our colleagues to clients, to one another, and to the communities where we live and work. I am meeting with our colleagues, clients and business leaders to identify areas where we can have greater impact and accelerate growth. As Dan noted, our clients are operating in a volatile environment where emerging issues are creating both challenges and opportunities. Our expertise, scale, data and insights position us well to meet their needs. I believe we have meaningful runway to harness the power of Marsh McLennan across our businesses and find the intersections where we can have outsized client impact. Together, we can accelerate innovation, deliver critical solutions, and drive growth and value for shareholders. Marsh McLennan has tremendous momentum, as evidenced by our strong fourth quarter results. Highlights include continued double-digit underlying revenue growth and record adjusted operating income. We closed out a fantastic year with fourth quarter underlying revenue growth of 10%, the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and the longest stretch of double digit quarterly growth in over two decades. Looking at risk in insurance services, fourth quarter revenue was $3 billion, up 20% compared with the year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $557 million, while our adjusted operating margin declined 80 basis points to 22.7%, reflecting investments made in the business. For the year, revenue was a record $12.1 billion with underlying growth of 10%. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 17% to a record $3 billion with a margin of 28.5%, up 50 basis points from the same period a year ago. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 22% compared with the year ago. Revenue growth was 9% on an underlying basis. U.S. and Canada delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth in the double digits for the third consecutive quarter at 11%. In international, underlying revenue growth was 7%. Latin America grew 14%, Asia Pacific was up 10%, and EMEA was up 5%. For the year, Marsh's revenue was $10.2 billion with underlying growth of 11%. U.S. and Canada underlying revenue growth was 13% and international was up 9%, the highest since we began reporting these regions in 2008. Guy Carpenter's fourth quarter revenue was $170 million, up 5% on an underlying basis. For the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.9 billion of revenue and 9% underlying growth.  In the consulting segment, revenue of $2.1 billion was a fourth quarter record, up 10% from a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis, the third consecutive quarter of double digit growth. Adjusted operating income increased 6% to $410 million. The adjusted operating margin was 20.2%, down 120 basis points versus a year ago, reflecting investments in the business. Consulting generated revenue of $7.8 billion for the year, representing underlying growth of 10%, the highest in nearly 15 years. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 19% to $1.5 billion, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 19.8%. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis. Career grew 15% on an underlying basis. This is the third straight quarter of double digit growth in the Career business. We are seeing strong demand for solutions linked to new ways of working, skills gaps, workforce transformation, and D&I issues like pay equity. Wealth increased 4% on an underlying basis, reflecting growth in both investment management and defined benefits. Our assets under management grew to $415 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 16% year-over-year, benefiting from net new inflows and market gains. Health underlying revenue growth was 4% in the quarter. For the year, revenue at Mercer was $5.3 billion, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis, the highest in over a decade. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $722 million, an increase of 22% on an underlying basis. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth and reflects continued strong demand across geographies and practices. For the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $2.5 billion, an increase of 21% on an underlying basis. Overall, our strong fourth quarter and full year 2021 performance, as well as the investments we made in the year, sets us up for success in 2022 and beyond. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our initial outlook for 2022. Yes Elyse, what I would add is that the hiring was principally in three different areas. We've tried to be quite strategic and wanted to focus on some of the disruption in the marketplace, so we made strategic hires at Marsh, Guy Carpenter, and Mercer. They have on-boarded, so you asked that question - they joined us mostly in the second half of the year, some on the first of January but largely in the second half of the year.  The second area of hiring, and this was mostly at Marsh, was around the operational excellence program that Dan spoke to. We're standing up centers of excellence in support of segregation of duties, moving mid back office work to lower cost environments leading to better client outcomes, better colleague experience, but it also will increase over time the capacity of our market-facing colleagues, so we're excited about that investment.  Then the third area was in early career. We paused in 2020 at the height of the pandemic, but we got back at it last year and on-boarded some early career colleagues. We're quite bullish on the hiring that we did. We're in a period now of on-boarding these colleagues and getting them to a productive state as quickly as possible. Sure. We remain active in the market, Jimmy, for sure. As Dan noted, we have a good, solid pipeline. We did seven deals in the fourth quarter, three at MMA, modest deals at MMA, we did three deals at Marsh as well, one quite small but India, of course, was quite important and very strategic for us. We also acquired an Affinity broker in France, so we're excited about what that can do for our business there, and then of course we did Huron, as Dan mentioned in his prepared remarks earlier. We're looking for strong performing businesses that are well led, that make us better in some way - they either fit a market that we're not serving at the moment or particularly strong in, or in a geography maybe that we don't cover all that well. An example of that was last year with the acquisition of PayneWest, which was a high performing business, outstanding leadership team, performing well, and they're just a terrific cultural fit and it fit perfectly for us in the upper northwest of MMA's operations here in the United States. We'll continue to be active, and maybe one thing just to add on the multiple side, we've seen some MGAs that I think--certainly some very, very high multiples in the MGA market. I think many of them are kind of trading under the insuretech label and so driving some interest there. We haven't been particularly active in that market. We keep a close eye on it and we serve many of them as clients through Guy Carpenter, but outside of that we've earned a terrific reputation in the market, and so we end up with good, high quality conversations before things go to market. Sure Mike. As Dan noted, it was the 17th consecutive quarter of price increases, so this market obviously has had some legs, at least compared to the time that I've been in it, which is a long time. There was some moderation in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. I think cyber is probably the biggest outlier in all this. Maybe Mark and Dean can talk about their observations in a second, but the underwriting community in cyber of course is still reacting to the frequency and severity of ransomware claims, and they're worried about systemic events as well but I think the market reaction right now is more driven by ransomware losses. The market remains challenging for our clients, and broadly speaking the underwriting community is worried about property cat losses, the impact of inflation on loss cost, and as I mentioned earlier, cyber related claims. Martin, you want to share some thoughts about the market? Got it, thanks Martin. Dean, we just had a big reinsurance renewal January 1. What's happening in the reinsurance market? Got it, thank you Dean. Another question, Mike? Look, at some point would that become the case? Sure, that's a potential, but I don't think we're running into that risk at the moment. And by the way, is it discretionary? Yes, it's discretionary. I would say about 50% of our clients in the United States, only 50% of them buy standalone cyber coverage and about 25% of our clients outside the United States buy standalone cyber coverage. The market is finding an equilibrium, it's sorting out how to deal with ransomware. When Martin talked about the price increase, that doesn't all manifest itself in premium growth or increased premiums for our clients. Underwriters are insisting on higher attachment points, co-insurance for ransomware, sub-limits for example - that all gets factored into the rate change that we talk about, so we work with our clients and we work with the markets to try to find the best way to finance the risk. It's not just financing risk after the fact, of course. We're actively working across the entire firm - Marsh, Guy Carpenter, Oliver Wyman, Mercer to help our clients better understand the risk and take steps to mitigate the risk upfront, but also the impact of an event once it happens. Sure. David, we have an excellent brand as an employer, I think as evidenced by the amount of talent we were able to attract last year. We've got purpose-driven culture, our colleagues are highly engaged, we do impactful work, we're a collaborative place to work. You feel like you're part of a team when you work at Marsh McLennan. It's also a place where you can learn and develop, as Dan noted before, and we pay well too. Pay is not everything, of course, but it's important.  We took the opportunity last year to strengthen the team. I talked about the three different areas earlier - strat hires, service centers, and in early career. I think we started 2021 with the best team on the field, and we're starting 2022 even stronger. Our focus is on on-boarding and getting those colleagues productive, but we will be active in the market and take advantage of our brand at times, but we won't have the same level of organic hiring in 2022."

You're right - our business does tend to prosper when the economy is really healthy, but I think we also see that when our clients' questions change, they often need more support, and the short answer is we're not seeing any slowdown in the business in the first quarter. Our pipeline is strong, and really over the last 12 months and still well into the first quarter, we're optimistic because the growth is very broad-based across almost every single one of our industry areas and the vast majority of our capabilities, whether it's payments or private equity, whether it's climate or digital, whether it's growth strategy or cost management and restructuring. It is broad-based growth, and we're not seeing an omicron effect."

You've seen deceleration in most of the geographies. An interesting outlier in Latin America, where rate increases continue to be strong. If I turn to cat lines and more cat-exposed areas, still strength there. [Indiscernible] casualty, which is still showing some deceleration, there's still strength in the umbrella area in the property book. Those that are multi-line and multilayer insurers are double what you see for single carriers, so where there are cat exposures, you're still seeing price increases, and that's a trend you're seeing across the board. As you said, John, on cyber, very strong, almost double in Europe and over 100% in North America for cyber, so still strength."

            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you John, and good morning.  As Dan and John mentioned, our financial performance in the fourth quarter was strong, capping an outstanding year. We saw another quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth and meaningful earnings growth despite substantial investments that position us for continued success.  We generated GAAP EPS of $1.57 in the quarter and adjusted EPS of $1.36, up 14% versus a year ago. Operating income was $986 million and adjusted operating income was $905 million, a fourth quarter record. Our adjusted operating margin decreased 90 basis points in the fourth quarter to 20.4%, reflecting significant investments in the business. As we noted on our third quarter call, while we are excited about the future benefits these investments will deliver, they come with upfront cost we absorbed in the short term.  Our full year 2021 results were outstanding. Our adjusted EPS was $6.17, an increase of 24%, the highest is over two decades. Full year operating income was $4.3 billion and our adjusted operating income was also $4.3 billion. Finally, our adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points, marking our 14th consecutive year of margin expansion.  2021 was also a strong year for capital management. We completed our JLT-related deleveraging, enhanced our short term liquidity flexibility, and saw S&P, Moody's and Fitch restore our rating outlook to stable.  Through solid operating performance and our focus on working capital efficiency, we also exceeded our plans for capital deployment. This included a 15% increase in our dividend and $1.2 billion of share repurchases. This was the highest level of share repurchases since 2015, resulting in a meaningful reduction in our share count. John covered our business operating results, so I'll cover some of the other aspects of our performance and outlook. Adjusted corporate expense was $62 million in the fourth quarter. As we had expected, foreign exchange was a modest headwind. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.07 headwind in 2022, most of which will affect the first half of the year.  As we typically do on our fourth quarter calls, I will give a brief update on our global retirement plan.  Our other net benefit credit was $66 million on a GAAP basis in the quarter and $277 million for the full year. For 2022, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be about $255 million. Cash contributions to our global defined benefits plans were $129 million in 2021 compared with $143 million in 2020. We expect cash contributions in 2022 will be roughly $180 million. Investment income was $18 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and $14 million on an adjusted basis. For the full year 2021, our investment income was $61 million on a GAAP basis and $55 million on an adjusted basis.  Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $109 million. Based on our current forecasts, we expect a similar level of quarterly interest expense in 2022.  Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.6% compared with 24% in the fourth quarter last year, and reflected some discrete benefits we realized in the quarter. For the full year 2021, our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.6% compared to 24.4% for the full year 2020. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume and adjusted effective tax rate of around 25% for 2022.  Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $11 billion, including the proceeds from the $750 million of senior notes we issued in December. We used a portion of the proceeds to redeem $500 million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature in January. Our next scheduled debt maturity isn't until March of 2023. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.2 billion and included $276 million for dividends, $494 million for acquisitions, and $425 million for share repurchases. For the year, uses of cash totaled $3.7 billion and included $1 billion for dividends, $1.1 billion for acquisitions, $1.2 billion for share repurchases, and $500 million for debt repayment.  Now that we've completed our post-JLT deleveraging, we expect to return to our strategy of balanced capital management which supports our consistent focus on delivering solid performance in the near term while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We prioritize reinvestment in the business, both through organic investments and acquisitions.  In 2011, our revenues were $11.5 billion. Today we stand at nearly $20 billion and acquired revenues have accounted for roughly half of this growth. These acquisitions have added critical capabilities, talent, greater scale, expanded insights, and have driven significant value for clients and shareholders. We have consistently said that we prefer acquisitions to share repurchases. We view high quality acquisitions as better at creating value for shareholders and the company over the long term; however, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time and each year, we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count.  Looking ahead to 2022, the combination of our available cash and expected cash generation sets us up for another year of significant capital deployment. Based on our outlook today, we currently expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2022 across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As we look to 2022, we are well positioned given the strong momentum across our businesses as well as a largely favorable macroeconomic and P&C pricing backdrop. Based on our outlook today for the full year 2022, we expect to deliver underlying revenue growth of mid single digits or better, margin expansion, and solid growth in adjusted EPS.  Keep in mind 2021 benefited from several items such as significant investment income and favorable discrete tax benefits that can fluctuate considerably from year to year. Also, as you consider the phasing of expenses in 2022, recognize that we made significant investments in talent in 2021 and don't begin the lap the full impact of these costs until the second half of the year. In summary, 2021 was a remarkable year, one in which all of our businesses delivered outstanding performance. We made substantial organic investments in the business, continued to execute on our acquisition strategy, completed our deleveraging, and resumed meaningful share repurchases. We are proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value they deliver to our clients and shareholders. We close the year on a high note and look forward to another year of strong performance in 2022. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to Dan. Yes. Mike, we would. Fiduciary interest income in 2021, I hope bottomed out at $15 million. If you look back just two years ago, it was $105 million, so the pandemic and the impact on short term rates really took the wind out of that line item. If rates climb, that certainly is a source of opportunity for us. Just keep in mind as you think about 2022, it's a function of not only how rates move, when they move and where they move. We've got fiduciary balances outside of the U.S., obviously, but certainly if rates go up over the next couple of years, that's opportunity for us."

Similarly, we've come into the year with good momentum, strong sales, and what we've been busy with for the last part of '21 has not gone away - if anything, it's continuing to accelerate, whether it's a talent war, labor shortage, skill gaps, redefining the way that we work, the return to work that has been in and out, in and out in many countries. That's keeping the team busy. For now, we're not seeing much of an impact, and if anything, commenting on health a little bit, that has also been impacted. We have seen enrolled lives come up, we don't see this going away, at least not in the near future, and some medical inflation returning as well, impacting premiums because the non-COVID medical treatment has picked up. We might see a little bit of a gap there due to omicron, but I don't think it will last."

Third quarter 2021 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh & McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I am Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer, of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh & McLennan had another outstanding quarter. Our third quarter results reflects strong momentum across all of our businesses. Our continued strength represents a combination of the current environment as well as impressive day-to-day execution across the firm. Although there continues to be uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we are seeing solid demand for our differentiated advice and solutions. Even as COVID-19 continues to pose risk in many parts of the world, vaccine rollouts are having a positive impact. We are taking advantage of opportunities to add to our deep bench of world class talent. At the core of our business is a focus on our colleagues and we are dedicated to Marsh & McLennan being an exciting and dynamic place to work for outstanding people. And we continue to innovate and leverage the collective strengths of our organization to help clients address their most pressing concerns including climate, diversity and inclusion, the future of work, cyber, and digital strategies.  As we have discussed 2021 represents Marsh & McLennan\u2019s 158th year and success over such a long period of time requires constant innovation and investment to deliver sustained growth and profitability. I'd like to discuss just a few recent examples of how we are innovating to develop new unique client solutions. Nick Studer leads our firm wide climate initiative. We view climate as a significant opportunity and we are well positioned to help clients with this critical issue. In October Oliver Wyman launched the climate action navigator drawing on insights from across the company. This product helps public and private sector leaders plot a path through climate science, identifying emissions at the industry and regional level, and quantifying the effects of multiple different carbon reduction technologies and actions. We believe these tools will give business and government leaders vital insights to achieve their long-term climate goals and be a significant enabler of the transition to low carbon climate resilient investments in the corporate sector.  Mercer recently launched Skills-Edge, an innovative platform allowing employers to determine the most important skills for their future and design a talent strategy to assess, acquire, and retain them. Skills-Edge provides quantitative insight into the demand and value of skills that supports both employees and organizations and rapidly re-skilling for the future of work. And just last week under the leadership of John Doyle we launched our Cyber Risk Analytics Center, this brings together cyber risk data and analytics expertise across our firm and provides clients with a comprehensive assessment of their cyber threats existing in future controls and the potential economic impact. We are one enterprise and these are just a few recent examples of how we bring together and leverage knowledge and capabilities across the firm to offer comprehensive solutions to our clients and address their most pressing concerns.  We are a growth company as demonstrated by our track record. Growth doesn't just happen, it takes consistent vision, alignment, commitment, and execution. Since closing our acquisition of JLT we've grown our total consolidated revenue by 27%, our adjusted EPS by 34%, and our colleague base by 22%. Achieving and sustaining growth requires consistent reinvestment in the business. We always strive to balance delivering results in the short-term while investing for the long-term. In 2021 we generated year-to-date adjusted EPS growth that is higher than any annual period in over three decades while at the same time investing for the future and making a significant press on hiring. We grew our headcount year-to-date by nearly 5000 or around 7% mostly organic adds with an emphasis on client facing roles. We expect this influx of talent will drive growth, add to our capabilities, and enhance our ability to serve clients.  Now let me provide an update on current PNC insurance market conditions. Many of the factors that drove the market to harden over the last few years continue suggesting an inflection to a soft market is unlikely in the near-term. The Marsh Global Insurance market index showed price increases of 15% year-over-year consistent with the second quarter. This marks the 16th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial PNC insurance market place. Looking at pricing by line the Marsh market index showed global property insurance was up 9%, global financial and professional lines were up 32% driven in part by a near doubling in cyber rates, and global casually rates were up high single digits on average. As a reminder our index skews to large account business. However small and middle market insurance rates continued to rise as well although less than for large complex accounts.  Turning to reinsurance, measured and moderate rate increases in global property catastrophe reinsurance witnessed in the first half of 2021 could persist throughout the remainder of the year reflecting adequate capacity offset by elevated global catastrophes, concerns around real end social inflation, and a continuation of large individual risk losses. 2021 marks another year of significant catastrophe losses. Hurricane Ida generated material losses in both the Southeast and Northeast. This is in addition to a record level of flood losses in Europe, flooding in China, and the continuation of wildfire losses in many parts of the world. Marsh & McLennan remains focused on helping our clients navigate these challenging market conditions and making a difference for them in the moments that matter.  Now let me turn to our terrific third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.08 which is up 32% versus a year ago driven by strong top line growth and continued low levels of T&E. Total revenue increased 16% versus a year ago and rose 13% on an underlying basis. The second consecutive quarter of record underlying growth in over two decades. Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 12% in consulting. Marsh grew 13% in the quarter on an underlying basis and benefited from strong new business and renewal growth. Guy Carpenter grew 15% on an underlying basis in the quarter, continuing its string of excellent results. Mercer underlying revenue grew 7% in the quarter the highest in over a decade. Oliver Wyman grew underlying revenue 25%, the second consecutive quarter in excess of 20%. Overall the third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 19% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points year-over-year.  Given our excellent third quarter and year-to-date performance we are on track for a terrific year. We expect to generate the best underlying revenue and adjusted EPS growth in over two decades and expand margins for the 14th consecutive year. Our entire organization is on its front foot, focused and aligned and this is evident in our excellent results. With that let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. \nMark McGivney: Thank you Dan and good morning. Our results were outstanding with record third quarter revenue, second consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth, margin expansion, and significant earnings growth. Highlights from our third quarter performance included the second straight quarter of 13% underlying growth in RIS with 13% at Marsh and 15% in Guy Carpenter and the second consecutive quarter of 12% underlying growth in consulting with 7% at Mercer and 25% at Oliver Wyman. Growth and adjusted earnings per share exceeded 30% for the second quarter in a row. Consolidated revenue increased 16% in the third quarter to 4.6 billion reflecting underlying growth of 13%.  Operating income in the quarter was 740 million, an increase of 37%. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to 759 million and our adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points to 18.5%. GAAP EPS was $1.05 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 32% to $1.08. For the first nine months of 2021, underlying revenue growth was 10%, our adjusted operating income grew 21% to 3.4 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 120 basis points, and our adjusted EPS increased 28% to $4.82.  Looking at risk and insurance services, third quarter revenue was 2.7 billion up 17% compared with the year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 21% to 403 million. Adjusted operating income also increased 21% to 469 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 20.4%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was 9 billion with underlying growth of 11%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 20% to 2.5 billion with a margin of 30.3% up 80 basis points from the same period a year ago.  At Marsh revenue in the quarter was 2.4 billion, up 17% compared with the year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. Growth in the quarter was broad based and driven by nearly 40% new business growth and solid retention. U.S. and Canada delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth of 16%. In international underlying growth was 9%, Latin America grew 12%, it\u2019s the best growth since the fourth quarter of 2015, Asia Pacific was up 9%, and EMEA was up 8%. For the first nine months of the year Marsh's revenue was 7.3 billion with underlying growth of 12%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 14% and international was up 9%.  Guy Carpenter\u2019s third quarter revenue was 314 million up 15% compared with the year ago on both the GAAP and underlying basis. Growth was broad based across geographies and specialties. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 7% or higher underlying growth in seven of the last nine quarters. In the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated 1.7 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth.  In the consulting segment revenue in the quarter was 1.9 billion up 13% from a year ago or 12% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 45% to 404 million. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to 350 million. The adjusted operating margin was 18.9% in line with the margin in the third quarter of 2020. Consulting generated revenue of 5.7 billion for the first nine months of 2021 representing underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 25% to 1.1 billion and the adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 19.6%.  Mercer\u2019s revenue was 1.3 billion in the quarter up 7% on an underlying basis, the highest result in over a decade. Career grew 13% on an underlying basis reflecting the continuing rebound in the global economy and business confidence. Wealth increased 6% on an underlying basis reflecting strong growth in investment management and modest growth in defined benefit. Our assets under delegated management grew to nearly 400 billion at the end of the third quarter up 24% year-over-year benefiting from net new inflows and market gains. Help underlying revenue growth was 4% in the quarter driven by growth outside the U.S.  Oliver Wyman\u2019s revenue in the quarter was 610 million, an increase of 25% on an underlying basis. This represents the second consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth as demand remains strong across most geographies and practices. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was 1.8 billion, an increase of 21% on an underlying basis. Adjusted corporate expense was 60 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange had a negligible impact on earnings in Q3. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels we expect FX to be a modest headwind in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was 69 million in the quarter and we expect it will remain at this level in the fourth quarter. Investment income was 13 million in the quarter on a GAAP basis and 12 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains on our private equity portfolio.  Interest expense in the third quarter was 107 million compared with 128 million in the third quarter of 2020 reflecting lower debt levels in the period. Based on our current forecast we expect interest expense in the fourth quarter to be similar to the amount in the third quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 24.4% compared with 26.5% in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP tax rate was 24.2% in the third quarter down from 30.3% in the third quarter of 2020 which was impacted by some unusual items. Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% compared with 24.6% last year. Based on the current environment we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021 excluding discrete items.  Given our year-to-date performance we are on track for an outstanding year. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter keep in mind that comparisons become more challenging given the rebound in growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. We also continue to build for the long-term by investing and hiring. While we are excited about the future benefit these investments will deliver, they come with upfront costs we absorb in the short-term. That said, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver exceptional results today while investing for the future and expect we will continue to do so.  Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with 10.7 billion of total debt. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in January of 2022 when 500 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy at least 3.5 billion of capital in 2021 of which at least 3 billion will be deployed across dividends, acquisition, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops.  Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was 1.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled 665 million and included 272 million for dividends, 93 million for acquisitions, and 300 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months uses of cash totaled 2.6 billion and included 750 million for dividends, 566 million for acquisitions, 734 million for share repurchases, and 500 million for debt repayment. We had a remarkable third quarter positioning us well to deliver strong growth in both revenue and adjusted earnings in 2021 and with that I'm happy to turn it back to Dan. \nDan Glaser: Thanks Mark. And operator we are ready to begin Q&A. \nOperator: Thank you. . Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: Hi, good morning. My first question goes back to the hiring that you guys have done, it seems continued in the third quarter. I was hoping to get more color on the impact you're seeing to both margin and top line growth. I think you alluded to some of that coming through on the expense and margin side from the hiring. But I'm hoping to get a sense of just the potential growth that could come from these hires given  as well as potential RFPs on renewals coming in 2022? \nDan Glaser: Yeah, thanks Elyse. We've been at it for 150 years so things like gardening leaves don't bother us all that much. Yeah we're definitely in it for the long haul. As we mentioned in the script, our head count growth year-to-date is up nearly 5000 across the firm and the highest percentage growth by far is in Marsh and Guy Carpenter and of course the majority of the hiring that we've done is in client facing roles. And so we may not be like other firms and that we generally hire to grow capability and talent rather than direct short-term revenue production. But having said that, we are a people business, our colleagues are our engine of growth, and undoubtedly our increased hiring in 2021 will benefit next year and beyond. Sometimes it takes a bit of time to get all the hires fully integrated into the firm and producing levels in terms of their own capacity at an optimal level but we're very comfortable with that. And of course there's a cost factor with that, we are not shy to face sophisticated talent is expensive. But it's worth it and that's why we pursue it. And I don't want anyone to worry out there about our long-term expense base, why all of this hiring. We know how to run the business. Our comp and ben ratio if I look at Q3 on a rolling four quarter basis and then go back five years and locate Q3 on a rolling four quarter basis is virtually identical. So, over time we're building the company, we're doing it through organic and we're doing it through acquisition. Next question. \nElyse Greenspan: Thank and then my follow-up. \nDan Glaser: Go ahead Elyse. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan. \nDan Glaser: Thanks, and Andrew maybe later we go back to Elyse because she did not get a chance to ask her follow-up. \nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So I just had a question on pricing and if you could talk about what's going in primary commercial as well as reinsurance and then how much of a pushback are you seeing from clients now that they're facing sort of price on price because rates have been going up for a while now? \nDan Glaser: That's a very good question Jimmy. And it is a tough market out there. Why don't we start with John and then we'll go to Peter afterwards and we will address the primary markets in reinsurance. So John? \nJohn Q. Doyle: Sure, good morning Jimmy. As you noted the PNC market conditions remain pretty challenging for our clients, prices were up about 15% on average in the quarter which was consistent with the second quarter. The property market was plus 9 versus plus 12 in the second quarter. It was obviously quite an active cat quarter, flood and wind and wildfire related losses but secondary perils are getting a lot of attention from the underwriting community in the market. Cat was up about 6 although up closer to double-digit globally when you exclude the work comp market in the United States where things remained pretty competitive. The excess market remained particularly challenging here in the United States, the underwriting community worried about our lost cost inflation, social inflation really as courts reopened from being largely closed during the pandemic. The financial lines market I think on average is the most difficult market for the moment for our clients although having said that public D&O pricing is still up but it's up about 10 points versus 15 points in the second quarter and that pricing -- that price increase, that rate of increase is the lowest it's been in the last ten quarter. So starting to see a little bit of settling on that work. Without question the market that is most challenging at the moment is the cyber market where prices were up more than 90% on average driven by material growth in ransom wear plans I'm sure you're familiar with, as well as concerns about systemic events. We have had a few events that maybe modest compared to what potentially could happen but underwriters remain concerned about that. You asked about clients, certainly frustrated by it for sure and some are retaining more risk, we've been a pretty active in creating new captives and there's a premium growth in the captives that we manage as well. Some are also electing to retain more risk and then in some cases of course the market is forcing some of our clients to retain more risk. So, it's client by client and exposure by exposure. As Dan said we are aggressively working to help our clients navigate the market. I will add that although on average the price was -- the average increase was the same globally, most markets did see great moderation. The United States was really the one exception when you look at it on a global basis. \nDan Glaser: Thanks John. Peter? \nPeter Hearn: Thank you Dan. Jimmy, a lot of my comments reflect from a reinsurance perspective what John has said on insurance perspective. You have had market share in dealing with real and social inflation. They're dealing with low interest rate environment and on top of that we're facing something approaching $100 billion of global capacity losses in 2021. So I think it's safe to say that prospect of that will influence property reinsurance pricing at 1/1/22. But you have to look at the market through various lunges because there's a property market that has been affected by $300 billion plus losses over the last five years, of capacity losses. If you look at the cash market, the significant underlying rate lift has stabilized and improved significantly. Property reinsurance, -- casualty reinsurance contracts and so I would say the casualty market has been more stable. As John says and the same is true in reinsurance, if I would suggest, there is one hard element of our market right now it is cyber. I think reinsurers are looking at cyber capacity the same way they look at property catastrophe capacity with it allocated certain amount of aggregate and once they hit that aggregate that\u2019s it. So, I would say as you know we don't opine on 1/1 pricing or any significant quarter pricing we believe the market finds its own equilibrium and as a result of that we are preparing our clients based on exposure and experience for what they might expect at 1/1. But certainly the property market given the fact this is now the fifth year that reinsurers have had losses is going to be challenging. \nDan Glaser: Thanks Peter and Jimmy do you have a follow-up. \nJimmy Bhullar: Maybe I will ask just one on expenses and obviously in the near-term I'm assuming T&E is going to stay depressed but as you think about your expenses longer term, are there things that you're going to change resulting from the pandemic whether it's a lower real estate footprint or whatever else that you think provides you more of a long term benefit? \nDan Glaser: Yeah, I mean when we look at the impact of the pandemic, I think one of the biggest features is that most organizations will -- of our size and scale will adapt some sort of hybrid model. I think the days of 9 to 5 or 8 to 6, five days a week in the office are over for most companies. And so that will have an impact. It's a longer-term impact because in the short-term you've got your leases established and we want some social distancing in the office and we're not sure how this will develop over time. So we're going to be deliberate and flexible. We're not going to move that quickly on it. I mean we've had efforts over many years to become more efficient in our use of space and we've accomplished that quite a bit and that continues. But that certainly is our view. We also think that T&E won\u2019t come back quickly and may not reach the level of 2019 for quite a while. And I know in Marsh & McLennan our view is yes, we look forward to a day where we are going to visit clients in markets in their location. But we will travel with more purpose, we will probably travel with less people on various trips. And we will be more deliberate about it and I think that our clients will have that expectation as well.  So that hop on a plane anytime anywhere culture probably takes quite a long time to come back if ever. And so both of those things have expense implications for us that will be positive for shareholders in the long-term. And I would say the other thing is we are constantly seeking efficiency gains and we're working throughout the firm in order to drive efficiency gains and to become better at operations. So, why don\u2019t I turn it to John for a second, so we can talk a little bit because -- about some of our head count growth was in OPEX in the effort to drive some efficiency within the Marsh operation. And it's in its early stages but there was a pretty significant increase in headcount in that area. So, John you want to talk about that a second. \nJohn Q. Doyle: Sure Dan. We have the largest ever organic hiring in our history this year and we're quite excited about it. Dan touched on the market facing talent that we brought in a bit earlier. I will say it starts with the team, we began the year with -- our teams are deeper and strong as it's ever been. We worked really hard to come together with the team at JLT. We worked on purpose and culture and our colleagues are highly engaged and focused. But one of the things we are working on has been investing aggressively in our client service operations as well. We have a broad program called OPEX, short for operational excellence to improve efficiency, to improve client service outcomes but also to increase the capacity of our market facing colleagues as well. So a fair amount of hiring came in service centers around the world and of course it is not just talent, we're supporting that talent with investments in technologies. We try to automate more and more of our processes. \nDan Glaser: Thanks John. Next question please. \nOperator: And we have a follow-up question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks for taking me back. \nDan Glaser: Welcome back Elyse. \nElyse Greenspan: You guys reported 10% organic growth so far this year, we'll see how the Q4 shakes out. So put you within the range of double-digit for the year. Typically, you guys talked to a 3% to 5% view. Obviously we've been better this year to have all this hiring that seems like it'll be incremental to revenue next year as well. So could you give us an initial view, I know you guys typically wait till the fourth quarter, but just some initial thoughts that you could share with us when we think about the organic growth outlook for 2022?\nDan Glaser: Sure, sure. And I'll just start with the idea that fourth quarter the top line becomes a little bit more challenging, right. Because Marsh grew 4% in the fourth quarter of last year, Carpenter grew 5%, OW grew 4%, and Mercer was down 3%. So across the piece, a little bit tougher, but we've got good momentum in the business, and we feel good about this year. We also feel good about next year, and the year after. I mean, we have been fundamentally improving the company over the last decade. We are getting stronger on our capabilities, our geographic breadth, our ability to serve. I mean, all of those areas have really dramatically improved and we believe we are in fundamental growth markets, I mean the areas of risk, strategy, and people. I don't care what organization you are and what size, whether you're a large account or a midsize account, you have to address those on a strategic basis. And it is incredibly relevant to the C suite of those companies and organizations to address broadly risk strategy and people. And I think we have enduring competitive advantages as well. I mean, as we were talking before, nothing happens here without our colleagues. I mean, the quality of our organization, the talents that we have, the culture that we have, the broad capabilities, the global footprint, are all enduring competitive advantages. We also continue to acquire talent in the market and acquire businesses which improve us and improve our capabilities. In particular, in middle market, on the brokerage side.  So, there's a lot of growth opportunities, and then just to touch as well on expansion opportunities, I mean we're still weighted into upper middle market and large account, we've gotten better in the mid middle market, we're going to continue to get better, we're going to continue to broaden into the lower middle market and small commercial consumer. You'll see us in all of those areas in the future. Now, it's not going to be from one year to the next, seeing some just massive change but this is inevitable in terms of how we build out our business. We're leveraging the combined strength of our organization as one enterprise like never before, in areas of healthy societies, cyber protection gaps, climate. I mean all of those areas we were going to market and addressing our client\u2019s issues with them on a broad basis, not on a narrow basis. And so our opportunities for revenue growth, in my view are significant. I won't give you a number right now for 2022 but, I think that having not only broken out of the 3% to 5%, but actually tremendously exceeded the 5% level. I think this company can be a real growth firm and that we will prove that over time. We like to do and then say rather than the opposite, so I think it'll be exciting times at Marsh & McLennan. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on the headcount adds and so I just -- looking back you added 500 of new headcount in the fourth quarter of 2020 and then 2000 in the first half of 2021. I'm just wondering, did that have any impact on the organic growth this quarter at all or is that still on the come?\nDan Glaser: Yeah, it's negligible. We are seeing some revenue benefit from hiring that we've done at the end of last year and into this year. But most of it's on the comp. So tends to be -- you get the expenses right away and you get the revenue a bit later.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it, thanks. And just to follow-up on that last point, Dan. Just on -- it's sounds like really big hiring quarter this quarter, 3000 new headcount, if I sort of take the 5000, that you said you've hired year-to-date, is there any rule of thumb just to think about or maybe any sort of number you can give me and just how much that weighed on the operating margins in this quarter specifically?\nDan Glaser: Yeah, I'm not going to get into the expense that we're bearing now as a result. I think the -- one of the reasons that we have been pressing on hiring is twofold. One, we are growing very well on the top line and that was our anticipation, and also market opportunity. And so we are in our view an employer of choice in this space, and we are pressing our advantage at this moment in time. The hiring spurt is not going to last forever, but ultimately we saw an opportunity in the market through dislocation and other factors and we really pressed on that level. At the end, our expenses are relatively high compared to historical type of expense growth for us, but our expense growth is essentially driven by sales compensated -- by compensation and benefit but it's very hard sales compensation due to much higher levels of new business, variable compensation due to much higher levels of profitability and hiring. So comp and ben is driving most of our sales, most of our expense growth in the quarter and will ease itself out. But it's matching well with current levels of revenue growth. So we feel that this was a tremendously opportune time to build capabilities within the firm on an organic basis.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it, great, makes sense. Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thanks. Two quick questions. We saw sort of a bit of a fall-off in organic revenue growth in EMEA and an acceleration in Latin America. And I was hoping you could talk about what's going on in those individual markets?\nDan Glaser: Sure Meyer, John do you want take that. \nJohn Q. Doyle: Hey Meyer, it is really nothing all that extraordinary that happened in any of the region. Quarter-to-quarter, obviously, you can see some variation. We did have a bit of non-recurring issues and tougher comps in EMEA in the quarter, but they weren't material either. I am pleased with the growth in both regions and I expect us to continue to perform in both territories going forward. \nMeyer Shields: Okay, thanks. And then more broadly, obviously, the organic growth is phenomenal. I'm wondering, is there any element of the growth that is specific to like a post pandemic era that wouldn't recur?\nDan Glaser: It's a good question. We're going to find out over time. I think the one issue to just bear in mind is the awareness around issues is higher. And I say that because risk awareness is far higher, I think people awareness is far higher. There's whole categories of opportunity in the world for us and others in areas such as ESG, which was not, which is always considered by companies and organizations, but not nearly to the extent it is today. And so when you think about just what's going on in the world, with regard to climate or D&I, responsible investing, etc., these are all new areas of growth for us. You think about things like climate, which was probably not even considered by us 10 years ago and we think it is one of our major growth opportunities as a firm on a going forward basis. And so, I would just say we want to be a leader on ESG and we look at the addressable market in ESG as being enormous and right now it's kind of the developed world public companies. It's going to be all companies everywhere. And so from that standpoint, the addressable market is going to be quite large and we will be a significant player in it.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, thank you very much. \nDan Glaser: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Wolfe Research. \nMichael Zaremski: Hey great, good morning. I guess a follow-up to Meyer\u2019s question and maybe Elyse's, too. So, you're talking about -- you've been talking a while about broadening Marsh's capabilities, new categories which are exciting, I'm just curious if this kind of changes your views on M&A into new areas or technologies over time, or is it really just kind of what we should be thinking about this kind of same sandboxes -- M&A sandboxes you're in currently?\nDan Glaser: You know, our M&A sandbox is very broad, and maybe our M&A that we've actually executed on is narrower than what we actually look at. But the sandbox is quite broad and I think you'd be surprised at some of the adjacencies and areas we look at. I mean, we -- I think, as I was mentioning earlier, the areas of risk strategy and people have all kinds of elements to them, that would enable us to continue to build capabilities with acquiring firms. We like firms that have recurring revenue, we like firms that are advisory based with transactions. Doesn't mean that all of our acquisitions will fit that criteria but that's a lot of them. And then we also like firms where we can see the business benefit, the financial benefit to us even if it's a bit out there, we can see it. And some of the things we look at, frankly, and the amount of liquidity and money that's being generated in the world and available, we just look at it and say we can\u2019t -- we like the company, and it's interesting, but boy, we don't have 30 years to figure out whether it worked or not. And so we're a disciplined acquirer and we want to acquire things that not only build our capabilities, but also help us financially as well, even if only on an incremental basis. So, I would say we have a very broad sandbox, but our level of execution has been relatively narrow over the last 5 or 10 years and that probably continues on that basis. We look at a lot of things and we execute on things that we're really committed to.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay, great. I guess my follow-up and not to harp on it too much but -- because excellent -- your results were excellent. But, it sounds like you're saying that some of the margins were impacted by new hires. Is that the main influence, are there other items we should be thinking about? And I guess, just hiring spurt should be expected to continue in the near term and so we should be kind of thinking about that as we project margins and then maybe, I guess, when hiring slows, you have maybe easier comps in outer years?\nDan Glaser: Yeah, I mean, first of all, I wouldn't fret about the margins in the quarter. Ultimately, we've said many times, you have to look about margin expansion over longer stretches of time. We have improved our margins for 14 consecutive years and the results are really remarkable from a basis point improvement. Our margin is up 120 bps year-to-date and that's on top of 120 bps in 2020, and 110 bps in 2019. So it another role in our margins and I would expect that our margins next year are going to be better than they are this year, and so that's the way we operate the business, but it's an outcome. Now, we don't sit around the table figuring out how we're going to drive margin, what we do is we figure out how we're going to drive the underlying growth and earnings. That's the focus of the firm and the outcome of margin expansion is how we run the firm, where we think not every quarter but certainly every year revenue growth needs to exceed expense growth. And that's what we do and we've done it consistently. And so, we're thrilled about where we are. What I mentioned earlier is that, a lot of the expense growth right now is being driven by compensation around sales, and around increased profitability. And so I got really good place to be in and our earnings growth is very strong, remarkably strong. And so I hope that answers your question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. \nBrian Meredith: Hey, thanks. Couple questions. First, just curious, free cash flow down year-over-year, is that simply just due to the hires that you're having right now and should we expect to see free cash flow, let's start some good growth with earnings here, production 2022? \nDan Glaser: Thanks, Brian. I am going to hand it off to Mark for that. \nMark McGivney: Thank you, Brian. Actually, we're really happy with free cash flow. Year-to-date, I think you have to be careful. There's a lot that can happen and cause volatility in a quarter with the cash flow statement even across the year. But free cash flow growth for us has been a great story over a long period of time and you go back over a decade. We've generated double-digit growth in free cash flow and we're up -- if you look year-to-date this year, we are up 5% and that's on top of 56% growth in free cash flow last year. So I think any growth above a big stair up last year is pretty good. So I think overall, our cash generation this year is strong and that's what's enabling us to deploy so much capital. \nBrian Meredith: Great. It's really helpful. And then second question, Dan more just a broad based question here, inflation has been obviously a hot topic, just across the markets. Just give us your perspective on kind of what's going on with inflation right now and particularly as it relates to some of the kind of commercial lines, insurance market, are you seeing any inflationary pressures when you started handle claims for clients and stuff or not at this point?\nDan Glaser: Yeah. Why don't I take that and then I'll hand to John and Martine to just say, are you seeing inflation in any way in the conversations with clients and what we're hearing from markets. I mean, historically we've done some work and we tend to do as a company better in inflationary periods. I mean, elements of our revenue base react to inflation, such as higher insured values, and we've proven that we can manage our expense base and so sometimes the revenue runs a little bit because of inflation, and we're still managing our expense base. So when we've looked back to inflationary periods over the last 25 years, we've tended to outperform and do pretty well. And, overall, I'll just mention on the economic environment, not just inflation. I mean, there's a lot of positive features about the economic environment, particularly in the United States. I mean, sales are up, consumer spending is up, business confidence is positive. But there are a lot of potential risks and inflation is probably the biggest one of them. But you also have the supply chain issues that we've all been reading about, the return to office that we're all going to be navigating over the coming months, concerns around COVID variants, so it is a tremendously difficult time to look forward, say, four quarters or so and get a real bead on what the economic performance is. Although I do note that most GDP forecast for next year in that kind of 4% and 5% range, so not bad. But starting with John, what are you hearing from markets and clients around inflation, and then we'll go to Martine. \nJohn Q. Doyle: I am certainly hearing concerns on multiple levels, maybe I'll start just on the claim side for a second. And Peter mentioned earlier that more than $100 billion were the cat losses. Of course, we're typically accustomed to demand surge related kind of temporary inflation, if you will, around cat losses. But it's further, those issues are further exacerbated by the supply chain challenges that we're seeing in markets. So there's some level of concern there in terms of what it'll mean, ultimately, the lost costs around cats. I mentioned earlier, the impact of social inflation around liability claims and particularly here in the United States and a couple of other jurisdictions as courts reopen after the pandemic, and we're seeing some evidence of that, although broad based evidences is really yet to show itself. Of course, payrolls and employment levels are important from a demand perspective around commercial insurance and work comp in particular. And so there is concern about wage inflation from some of our clients and the impact on growing costs there. And maybe with that, you -- I will hand it to Martine to talk maybe more about the benefits side of the business.\nMartine Ferland: Yeah, thanks John and indeed, wage inflation and inflation in general usually we do well in these times; one, because our clients really need help in managing these increased costs. So, how do they manage through medical inflation, which we believe is coming back now that regular care will resume which is intended to keep premium a bit low during COVID. The same thing on wage inflation looking at federating transformation program with clients to address the pyramid and the profiles of their workforce. And in terms of pension plans as well, I mean we have to watch on that. And as soon as there's pressures in the economy and system, governance spike up in terms of helping clients manage the asset side of their pension funds more tightly and therefore, that's usually good for the OCIO business in our investment management solutions. And lastly, from a management of our business, most if not all of our multi-year assignments would have a dramatic adjustment to inflation so we've seen that movie before, some years ago.\nBrian Meredith: Thank you. \nDan Glaser: Thank you. Appreciate it. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks, good morning. First question on -- have you seen as a higher level any impact of tax reform on M&A activities at industry level, either it's changing the timing of it, of M&A or deals pay the multiples paid, any impact there at all?\nDan Glaser: Yeah, there's been in -- there's a lot of deals out there but that has been pretty consistent over the last several years. And whether there is some marginal impact of people trying to get ahead of whatever could happen in the U.S. tax environment, it would be on the edges. It's not driving like a more significant level than what we have seen. There's been a lot of sellers out there. I think there's a lot of sellers out there, mainly because there's a lot of capital out there, valuations are pretty strong, that is probably the biggest factor as to what's driving M&A activity.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on the last couple comments on inflation. You talked a lot about, a lot of questions on hiring and possible impacts on your margins there. But I guess specifically to you guys on wage inflation, any impacts there, you have seen and you felt and current margin where you expect to impact that in your margins, pretty specifically?\nDan Glaser: Yeah, I'll hand off to Martine and then to Nick to just talk about whether they're seeing in the client base and in fact, in our own firm any pressures around wage inflation. We're watching it very closely, obviously. You know, we're all reading about inflation in general and also in the dynamic between employers and employees, across many industries. The employees seem to be in charge right now and so I think that not only wages and benefits, but more broadly, environment of how companies operate, the attractiveness of their work environment, etc., are key factors in terms of the ability to retain people and the ability to attract high quality people. But why don't we start with Martine and see what you're seeing and then we'll go to Nick? \nMartine Ferland: Yeah, from a wage inflation point of view in the market, what we're seeing is that there's more pressure at the lower end of the wage spectrum, where there's a lot of movement there to attract people to jobs, that have been really hard hit during the pandemic. At the higher end of white collar professional, what we're seeing is a little bit of a musical chair, I would say. So there's a great resignation, there's quite a people have moved, people are looking for different careers. And we need to help our clients manage through these pressures and demand. But I think this element of it will be temporary and will settle itself over time. I mean, as clients look at -- as I said earlier, transforming, focusing on the skills they need rather than jobs and roles, we see a very important trend there. Dan has spoken earlier about our Skills-Edge platform that helped client migrate to that. These are all techniques that will help clients get through this change that we're seeing right now.\nDan Glaser: So let me hand over to Nick with a bit of a shout out for Oliver Wyman, because two quarters in a row of 20% plus organic growth, not bad, not bad, and I'm looking forward to finalizing the budget conversation with you later on today. Nick are you seeing some wage inflations, are you hearing it from clients as well?\nNick Studer: Yeah, thanks Dan. Thank you, Michael for the question as well. I think I agree with the way that Dan and Martine have both characterized this overall. In our businesses it is a competitive market for talent. I think we fit in our clients, I think we particularly see it in our business. And there have been a couple of times when with our strong growth, capacity constraints have constrained our ability a little bit. I am not enormously worried by it. We are finding it -- we are hiring more than we hired, I think, maybe ever before but certainly over the last five years. I'm hiring extremely rapidly. But we see some of the musical chairs which Martine described across our businesses too. So in short, yes, there is a period of employee power and rising wages.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. I think we have time for another question or two. But next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: Hey thanks. Good morning. Dan, I just had one. How do you think about the growth dynamics of the talent pool in the industry as a whole whether it's a consulting you do or PNC brokerage, I guess I ask because we know there is some areas of brokerage, I guess it's more in the personal line side where there's kind of secular talent outflow, I'm just trying to get a sense\u2026?\nDan Glaser: No, it is a very good question. We see no, Ryan it is a great question but we see no problem with our ability to attract talent. In fact, when we hire 5000 people, you have to understand we are interviewing 25,000 to 30,000 interviews taking place. We are very selective on how we approach talent. Every time we're seeking talent we have numerous applicants. And so I think, at the very heart of it is the work that we do. We're not an insurance business, we're a risk business. We're not a people business, from an administrative standpoint, we're a strategic people business. And so from that standpoint, the purpose of the organization of making a difference for companies, in their moments that matter, and those inflection points I think it is very attractive. And so where we're able to compete with the best firms in the world for high levels of talent, and when you have the broad base that we have, you can take some risks around, okay, so that person is not a subject matter expert, but boy, they've got a history of success. And let's see how they do. And so we can go a little bit broader. So we see none of the constraints that some folks particularly in the insurance industry have in terms of inflow of talent.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan for any closing remarks.\nDan Glaser: Thank you, Andrew. And thank you everybody for joining us on the call this morning. In particular, I want to thank our 81,000 colleagues for their commitment to hard work and dedication to Marsh & McLennan, it shows. Thank you all very much and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Q. Doyle",
            "content": "Sure, good morning Jimmy. As you noted the PNC market conditions remain pretty challenging for our clients, prices were up about 15% on average in the quarter which was consistent with the second quarter. The property market was plus 9 versus plus 12 in the second quarter. It was obviously quite an active cat quarter, flood and wind and wildfire related losses but secondary perils are getting a lot of attention from the underwriting community in the market. Cat was up about 6 although up closer to double-digit globally when you exclude the work comp market in the United States where things remained pretty competitive. The excess market remained particularly challenging here in the United States, the underwriting community worried about our lost cost inflation, social inflation really as courts reopened from being largely closed during the pandemic. The financial lines market I think on average is the most difficult market for the moment for our clients although having said that public D&O pricing is still up but it's up about 10 points versus 15 points in the second quarter and that pricing -- that price increase, that rate of increase is the lowest it's been in the last ten quarter. So starting to see a little bit of settling on that work. Without question the market that is most challenging at the moment is the cyber market where prices were up more than 90% on average driven by material growth in ransom wear plans I'm sure you're familiar with, as well as concerns about systemic events. We have had a few events that maybe modest compared to what potentially could happen but underwriters remain concerned about that. You asked about clients, certainly frustrated by it for sure and some are retaining more risk, we've been a pretty active in creating new captives and there's a premium growth in the captives that we manage as well. Some are also electing to retain more risk and then in some cases of course the market is forcing some of our clients to retain more risk. So, it's client by client and exposure by exposure. As Dan said we are aggressively working to help our clients navigate the market. I will add that although on average the price was -- the average increase was the same globally, most markets did see great moderation. The United States was really the one exception when you look at it on a global basis. Sure Dan. We have the largest ever organic hiring in our history this year and we're quite excited about it. Dan touched on the market facing talent that we brought in a bit earlier. I will say it starts with the team, we began the year with -- our teams are deeper and strong as it's ever been. We worked really hard to come together with the team at JLT. We worked on purpose and culture and our colleagues are highly engaged and focused. But one of the things we are working on has been investing aggressively in our client service operations as well. We have a broad program called OPEX, short for operational excellence to improve efficiency, to improve client service outcomes but also to increase the capacity of our market facing colleagues as well. So a fair amount of hiring came in service centers around the world and of course it is not just talent, we're supporting that talent with investments in technologies. We try to automate more and more of our processes. Hey Meyer, it is really nothing all that extraordinary that happened in any of the region. Quarter-to-quarter, obviously, you can see some variation. We did have a bit of non-recurring issues and tougher comps in EMEA in the quarter, but they weren't material either. I am pleased with the growth in both regions and I expect us to continue to perform in both territories going forward. I am certainly hearing concerns on multiple levels, maybe I'll start just on the claim side for a second. And Peter mentioned earlier that more than $100 billion were the cat losses. Of course, we're typically accustomed to demand surge related kind of temporary inflation, if you will, around cat losses. But it's further, those issues are further exacerbated by the supply chain challenges that we're seeing in markets.

Of course, payrolls and employment levels are important from a demand perspective around commercial insurance and work comp in particular. And so there is concern about wage inflation from some of our clients and the impact on growing costs there.

            "name": "Dan Glaser",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I am Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer, of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh & McLennan had another outstanding quarter. Our third quarter results reflects strong momentum across all of our businesses. Our continued strength represents a combination of the current environment as well as impressive day-to-day execution across the firm. Although there continues to be uncertainty and volatility in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we are seeing solid demand for our differentiated advice and solutions. Even as COVID-19 continues to pose risk in many parts of the world, vaccine rollouts are having a positive impact. We are taking advantage of opportunities to add to our deep bench of world class talent. At the core of our business is a focus on our colleagues and we are dedicated to Marsh & McLennan being an exciting and dynamic place to work for outstanding people. And we continue to innovate and leverage the collective strengths of our organization to help clients address their most pressing concerns including climate, diversity and inclusion, the future of work, cyber, and digital strategies.  As we have discussed 2021 represents Marsh & McLennan's 158th year and success over such a long period of time requires constant innovation and investment to deliver sustained growth and profitability. I'd like to discuss just a few recent examples of how we are innovating to develop new unique client solutions. Nick Studer leads our firm wide climate initiative. We view climate as a significant opportunity and we are well positioned to help clients with this critical issue. In October Oliver Wyman launched the climate action navigator drawing on insights from across the company. This product helps public and private sector leaders plot a path through climate science, identifying emissions at the industry and regional level, and quantifying the effects of multiple different carbon reduction technologies and actions. We believe these tools will give business and government leaders vital insights to achieve their long-term climate goals and be a significant enabler of the transition to low carbon climate resilient investments in the corporate sector.  Mercer recently launched Skills-Edge, an innovative platform allowing employers to determine the most important skills for their future and design a talent strategy to assess, acquire, and retain them. Skills-Edge provides quantitative insight into the demand and value of skills that supports both employees and organizations and rapidly re-skilling for the future of work. And just last week under the leadership of John Doyle we launched our Cyber Risk Analytics Center, this brings together cyber risk data and analytics expertise across our firm and provides clients with a comprehensive assessment of their cyber threats existing in future controls and the potential economic impact. We are one enterprise and these are just a few recent examples of how we bring together and leverage knowledge and capabilities across the firm to offer comprehensive solutions to our clients and address their most pressing concerns.  We are a growth company as demonstrated by our track record. Growth doesn't just happen, it takes consistent vision, alignment, commitment, and execution. Since closing our acquisition of JLT we've grown our total consolidated revenue by 27%, our adjusted EPS by 34%, and our colleague base by 22%. Achieving and sustaining growth requires consistent reinvestment in the business. We always strive to balance delivering results in the short-term while investing for the long-term. In 2021 we generated year-to-date adjusted EPS growth that is higher than any annual period in over three decades while at the same time investing for the future and making a significant press on hiring. We grew our headcount year-to-date by nearly 5000 or around 7% mostly organic adds with an emphasis on client facing roles. We expect this influx of talent will drive growth, add to our capabilities, and enhance our ability to serve clients.  Now let me provide an update on current PNC insurance market conditions. Many of the factors that drove the market to harden over the last few years continue suggesting an inflection to a soft market is unlikely in the near-term. The Marsh Global Insurance market index showed price increases of 15% year-over-year consistent with the second quarter. This marks the 16th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial PNC insurance market place. Looking at pricing by line the Marsh market index showed global property insurance was up 9%, global financial and professional lines were up 32% driven in part by a near doubling in cyber rates, and global casually rates were up high single digits on average. As a reminder our index skews to large account business. However small and middle market insurance rates continued to rise as well although less than for large complex accounts.  Turning to reinsurance, measured and moderate rate increases in global property catastrophe reinsurance witnessed in the first half of 2021 could persist throughout the remainder of the year reflecting adequate capacity offset by elevated global catastrophes, concerns around real end social inflation, and a continuation of large individual risk losses. 2021 marks another year of significant catastrophe losses. Hurricane Ida generated material losses in both the Southeast and Northeast. This is in addition to a record level of flood losses in Europe, flooding in China, and the continuation of wildfire losses in many parts of the world. Marsh & McLennan remains focused on helping our clients navigate these challenging market conditions and making a difference for them in the moments that matter.  Now let me turn to our terrific third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.08 which is up 32% versus a year ago driven by strong top line growth and continued low levels of T&E. Total revenue increased 16% versus a year ago and rose 13% on an underlying basis. The second consecutive quarter of record underlying growth in over two decades. Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 12% in consulting. Marsh grew 13% in the quarter on an underlying basis and benefited from strong new business and renewal growth. Guy Carpenter grew 15% on an underlying basis in the quarter, continuing its string of excellent results. Mercer underlying revenue grew 7% in the quarter the highest in over a decade. Oliver Wyman grew underlying revenue 25%, the second consecutive quarter in excess of 20%. Overall the third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 19% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points year-over-year.  Given our excellent third quarter and year-to-date performance we are on track for a terrific year. We expect to generate the best underlying revenue and adjusted EPS growth in over two decades and expand margins for the 14th consecutive year. Our entire organization is on its front foot, focused and aligned and this is evident in our excellent results. With that let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. Thanks Mark. And operator we are ready to begin Q&A. Yeah, thanks Elyse. We've been at it for 150 years so things like gardening leaves don't bother us all that much. Yeah we're definitely in it for the long haul. As we mentioned in the script, our head count growth year-to-date is up nearly 5000 across the firm and the highest percentage growth by far is in Marsh and Guy Carpenter and of course the majority of the hiring that we've done is in client facing roles. And so we may not be like other firms and that we generally hire to grow capability and talent rather than direct short-term revenue production. But having said that, we are a people business, our colleagues are our engine of growth, and undoubtedly our increased hiring in 2021 will benefit next year and beyond. Sometimes it takes a bit of time to get all the hires fully integrated into the firm and producing levels in terms of their own capacity at an optimal level but we're very comfortable with that. And of course there's a cost factor with that, we are not shy to face sophisticated talent is expensive. But it's worth it and that's why we pursue it. And I don't want anyone to worry out there about our long-term expense base, why all of this hiring. We know how to run the business. Our comp and ben ratio if I look at Q3 on a rolling four quarter basis and then go back five years and locate Q3 on a rolling four quarter basis is virtually identical. So, over time we're building the company, we're doing it through organic and we're doing it through acquisition. Next question. Go ahead Elyse. Thanks, and Andrew maybe later we go back to Elyse because she did not get a chance to ask her follow-up. That's a very good question Jimmy. And it is a tough market out there. Why don't we start with John and then we'll go to Peter afterwards and we will address the primary markets in reinsurance. So John? Thanks John. Peter? Thanks Peter and Jimmy do you have a follow-up. Yeah, I mean when we look at the impact of the pandemic, I think one of the biggest features is that most organizations will -- of our size and scale will adapt some sort of hybrid model. I think the days of 9 to 5 or 8 to 6, five days a week in the office are over for most companies. And so that will have an impact. It's a longer-term impact because in the short-term you've got your leases established and we want some social distancing in the office and we're not sure how this will develop over time. So we're going to be deliberate and flexible. We're not going to move that quickly on it. I mean we've had efforts over many years to become more efficient in our use of space and we've accomplished that quite a bit and that continues. But that certainly is our view. We also think that T&E won't come back quickly and may not reach the level of 2019 for quite a while. And I know in Marsh & McLennan our view is yes, we look forward to a day where we are going to visit clients in markets in their location. But we will travel with more purpose, we will probably travel with less people on various trips. And we will be more deliberate about it and I think that our clients will have that expectation as well.  So that hop on a plane anytime anywhere culture probably takes quite a long time to come back if ever. And so both of those things have expense implications for us that will be positive for shareholders in the long-term. And I would say the other thing is we are constantly seeking efficiency gains and we're working throughout the firm in order to drive efficiency gains and to become better at operations. So, why don't I turn it to John for a second, so we can talk a little bit because -- about some of our head count growth was in OPEX in the effort to drive some efficiency within the Marsh operation. And it's in its early stages but there was a pretty significant increase in headcount in that area. So, John you want to talk about that a second. Thanks John. Next question please. Welcome back Elyse. Sure, sure. And I'll just start with the idea that fourth quarter the top line becomes a little bit more challenging, right. Because Marsh grew 4% in the fourth quarter of last year, Carpenter grew 5%, OW grew 4%, and Mercer was down 3%. So across the piece, a little bit tougher, but we've got good momentum in the business, and we feel good about this year. We also feel good about next year, and the year after. I mean, we have been fundamentally improving the company over the last decade. We are getting stronger on our capabilities, our geographic breadth, our ability to serve. I mean, all of those areas have really dramatically improved and we believe we are in fundamental growth markets, I mean the areas of risk, strategy, and people. I don't care what organization you are and what size, whether you're a large account or a midsize account, you have to address those on a strategic basis. And it is incredibly relevant to the C suite of those companies and organizations to address broadly risk strategy and people. And I think we have enduring competitive advantages as well. I mean, as we were talking before, nothing happens here without our colleagues. I mean, the quality of our organization, the talents that we have, the culture that we have, the broad capabilities, the global footprint, are all enduring competitive advantages. We also continue to acquire talent in the market and acquire businesses which improve us and improve our capabilities. In particular, in middle market, on the brokerage side.  So, there's a lot of growth opportunities, and then just to touch as well on expansion opportunities, I mean we're still weighted into upper middle market and large account, we've gotten better in the mid middle market, we're going to continue to get better, we're going to continue to broaden into the lower middle market and small commercial consumer. You'll see us in all of those areas in the future. Now, it's not going to be from one year to the next, seeing some just massive change but this is inevitable in terms of how we build out our business. We're leveraging the combined strength of our organization as one enterprise like never before, in areas of healthy societies, cyber protection gaps, climate. I mean all of those areas we were going to market and addressing our client's issues with them on a broad basis, not on a narrow basis. And so our opportunities for revenue growth, in my view are significant. I won't give you a number right now for 2022 but, I think that having not only broken out of the 3% to 5%, but actually tremendously exceeded the 5% level. I think this company can be a real growth firm and that we will prove that over time. We like to do and then say rather than the opposite, so I think it'll be exciting times at Marsh & McLennan. Next question, please. Yeah, it's negligible. We are seeing some revenue benefit from hiring that we've done at the end of last year and into this year. But most of it's on the comp. So tends to be -- you get the expenses right away and you get the revenue a bit later. Yeah, I'm not going to get into the expense that we're bearing now as a result. I think the -- one of the reasons that we have been pressing on hiring is twofold. One, we are growing very well on the top line and that was our anticipation, and also market opportunity. And so we are in our view an employer of choice in this space, and we are pressing our advantage at this moment in time. The hiring spurt is not going to last forever, but ultimately we saw an opportunity in the market through dislocation and other factors and we really pressed on that level. At the end, our expenses are relatively high compared to historical type of expense growth for us, but our expense growth is essentially driven by sales compensated -- by compensation and benefit but it's very hard sales compensation due to much higher levels of new business, variable compensation due to much higher levels of profitability and hiring. So comp and ben is driving most of our sales, most of our expense growth in the quarter and will ease itself out. But it's matching well with current levels of revenue growth. So we feel that this was a tremendously opportune time to build capabilities within the firm on an organic basis. Next question, please. Sure Meyer, John do you want take that. It's a good question. We're going to find out over time. I think the one issue to just bear in mind is the awareness around issues is higher. And I say that because risk awareness is far higher, I think people awareness is far higher. There's whole categories of opportunity in the world for us and others in areas such as ESG, which was not, which is always considered by companies and organizations, but not nearly to the extent it is today. And so when you think about just what's going on in the world, with regard to climate or D&I, responsible investing, etc., these are all new areas of growth for us. You think about things like climate, which was probably not even considered by us 10 years ago and we think it is one of our major growth opportunities as a firm on a going forward basis. And so, I would just say we want to be a leader on ESG and we look at the addressable market in ESG as being enormous and right now it's kind of the developed world public companies. It's going to be all companies everywhere. And so from that standpoint, the addressable market is going to be quite large and we will be a significant player in it. Next question, please. You know, our M&A sandbox is very broad, and maybe our M&A that we've actually executed on is narrower than what we actually look at. But the sandbox is quite broad and I think you'd be surprised at some of the adjacencies and areas we look at. I mean, we -- I think, as I was mentioning earlier, the areas of risk strategy and people have all kinds of elements to them, that would enable us to continue to build capabilities with acquiring firms. We like firms that have recurring revenue, we like firms that are advisory based with transactions. Doesn't mean that all of our acquisitions will fit that criteria but that's a lot of them. And then we also like firms where we can see the business benefit, the financial benefit to us even if it's a bit out there, we can see it. And some of the things we look at, frankly, and the amount of liquidity and money that's being generated in the world and available, we just look at it and say we can't -- we like the company, and it's interesting, but boy, we don't have 30 years to figure out whether it worked or not. And so we're a disciplined acquirer and we want to acquire things that not only build our capabilities, but also help us financially as well, even if only on an incremental basis. So, I would say we have a very broad sandbox, but our level of execution has been relatively narrow over the last 5 or 10 years and that probably continues on that basis. We look at a lot of things and we execute on things that we're really committed to. Yeah, I mean, first of all, I wouldn't fret about the margins in the quarter. Ultimately, we've said many times, you have to look about margin expansion over longer stretches of time. We have improved our margins for 14 consecutive years and the results are really remarkable from a basis point improvement. Our margin is up 120 bps year-to-date and that's on top of 120 bps in 2020, and 110 bps in 2019. So it another role in our margins and I would expect that our margins next year are going to be better than they are this year, and so that's the way we operate the business, but it's an outcome. Now, we don't sit around the table figuring out how we're going to drive margin, what we do is we figure out how we're going to drive the underlying growth and earnings. That's the focus of the firm and the outcome of margin expansion is how we run the firm, where we think not every quarter but certainly every year revenue growth needs to exceed expense growth. And that's what we do and we've done it consistently. And so, we're thrilled about where we are. What I mentioned earlier is that, a lot of the expense growth right now is being driven by compensation around sales, and around increased profitability. And so I got really good place to be in and our earnings growth is very strong, remarkably strong. And so I hope that answers your question. Next question, please. Thanks, Brian. I am going to hand it off to Mark for that. Yeah. Why don't I take that and then I'll hand to John and Martine to just say, are you seeing inflation in any way in the conversations with clients and what we're hearing from markets. I mean, historically we've done some work and we tend to do as a company better in inflationary periods. I mean, elements of our revenue base react to inflation, such as higher insured values, and we've proven that we can manage our expense base and so sometimes the revenue runs a little bit because of inflation, and we're still managing our expense base. So when we've looked back to inflationary periods over the last 25 years, we've tended to outperform and do pretty well. And, overall, I'll just mention on the economic environment, not just inflation. I mean, there's a lot of positive features about the economic environment, particularly in the United States. I mean, sales are up, consumer spending is up, business confidence is positive. But there are a lot of potential risks and inflation is probably the biggest one of them. But you also have the supply chain issues that we've all been reading about, the return to office that we're all going to be navigating over the coming months, concerns around COVID variants, so it is a tremendously difficult time to look forward, say, four quarters or so and get a real bead on what the economic performance is. Although I do note that most GDP forecast for next year in that kind of 4% and 5% range, so not bad. But starting with John, what are you hearing from markets and clients around inflation, and then we'll go to Martine. Thank you. Appreciate it. Next question, please. Yeah, there's been in -- there's a lot of deals out there but that has been pretty consistent over the last several years. And whether there is some marginal impact of people trying to get ahead of whatever could happen in the U.S. tax environment, it would be on the edges. It's not driving like a more significant level than what we have seen. There's been a lot of sellers out there. I think there's a lot of sellers out there, mainly because there's a lot of capital out there, valuations are pretty strong, that is probably the biggest factor as to what's driving M&A activity. Yeah, I'll hand off to Martine and then to Nick to just talk about whether they're seeing in the client base and in fact, in our own firm any pressures around wage inflation. We're watching it very closely, obviously. You know, we're all reading about inflation in general and also in the dynamic between employers and employees, across many industries. The employees seem to be in charge right now and so I think that not only wages and benefits, but more broadly, environment of how companies operate, the attractiveness of their work environment, etc., are key factors in terms of the ability to retain people and the ability to attract high quality people. But why don't we start with Martine and see what you're seeing and then we'll go to Nick? So let me hand over to Nick with a bit of a shout out for Oliver Wyman, because two quarters in a row of 20% plus organic growth, not bad, not bad, and I'm looking forward to finalizing the budget conversation with you later on today. Nick are you seeing some wage inflations, are you hearing it from clients as well? Thank you. I think we have time for another question or two. But next question, please. No, it is a very good question. We see no, Ryan it is a great question but we see no problem with our ability to attract talent. In fact, when we hire 5000 people, you have to understand we are interviewing 25,000 to 30,000 interviews taking place. We are very selective on how we approach talent. Every time we're seeking talent we have numerous applicants. And so I think, at the very heart of it is the work that we do. We're not an insurance business, we're a risk business. We're not a people business, from an administrative standpoint, we're a strategic people business. And so from that standpoint, the purpose of the organization of making a difference for companies, in their moments that matter, and those inflection points I think it is very attractive. And so where we're able to compete with the best firms in the world for high levels of talent, and when you have the broad base that we have, you can take some risks around, okay, so that person is not a subject matter expert, but boy, they've got a history of success. And let's see how they do. And so we can go a little bit broader. So we see none of the constraints that some folks particularly in the insurance industry have in terms of inflow of talent. Thank you, Andrew. And thank you everybody for joining us on the call this morning. In particular, I want to thank our 81,000 colleagues for their commitment to hard work and dedication to Marsh & McLennan, it shows. Thank you all very much and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter."

In our businesses it is a competitive market for talent. I think we fit in our clients, I think we particularly see it in our business. And there have been a couple of times when with our strong growth, capacity constraints have constrained our ability a little bit. I am not enormously worried by it. We are finding it -- we are hiring more than we hired, I think, maybe ever before but certainly over the last five years. I'm hiring extremely rapidly. But we see some of the musical chairs which Martine described across our businesses too. So in short, yes, there is a period of employee power and rising wages."

            "name": "Peter Hearn",
            "content": "Thank you Dan. Jimmy, a lot of my comments reflect from a reinsurance perspective what John has said on insurance perspective. You have had market share in dealing with real and social inflation. They're dealing with low interest rate environment and on top of that we're facing something approaching $100 billion of global capacity losses in 2021. So I think it's safe to say that prospect of that will influence property reinsurance pricing at 1/1/22. But you have to look at the market through various lunges because there's a property market that has been affected by $300 billion plus losses over the last five years, of capacity losses. If you look at the cash market, the significant underlying rate lift has stabilized and improved significantly. Property reinsurance, -- casualty reinsurance contracts and so I would say the casualty market has been more stable. As John says and the same is true in reinsurance, if I would suggest, there is one hard element of our market right now it is cyber. I think reinsurers are looking at cyber capacity the same way they look at property catastrophe capacity with it allocated certain amount of aggregate and once they hit that aggregate that's it. So, I would say as you know we don't opine on 1/1 pricing or any significant quarter pricing we believe the market finds its own equilibrium and as a result of that we are preparing our clients based on exposure and experience for what they might expect at 1/1. But certainly the property market given the fact this is now the fifth year that reinsurers have had losses is going to be challenging."

            "content": "Thank you Dan and good morning. Our results were outstanding with record third quarter revenue, second consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth, margin expansion, and significant earnings growth. Highlights from our third quarter performance included the second straight quarter of 13% underlying growth in RIS with 13% at Marsh and 15% in Guy Carpenter and the second consecutive quarter of 12% underlying growth in consulting with 7% at Mercer and 25% at Oliver Wyman. Growth and adjusted earnings per share exceeded 30% for the second quarter in a row. Consolidated revenue increased 16% in the third quarter to 4.6 billion reflecting underlying growth of 13%.  Operating income in the quarter was 740 million, an increase of 37%. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to 759 million and our adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points to 18.5%. GAAP EPS was $1.05 in the quarter and adjusted EPS increased 32% to $1.08. For the first nine months of 2021, underlying revenue growth was 10%, our adjusted operating income grew 21% to 3.4 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 120 basis points, and our adjusted EPS increased 28% to $4.82.  Looking at risk and insurance services, third quarter revenue was 2.7 billion up 17% compared with the year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 21% to 403 million. Adjusted operating income also increased 21% to 469 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 20.4%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was 9 billion with underlying growth of 11%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 20% to 2.5 billion with a margin of 30.3% up 80 basis points from the same period a year ago.  At Marsh revenue in the quarter was 2.4 billion, up 17% compared with the year ago or 13% on an underlying basis. Growth in the quarter was broad based and driven by nearly 40% new business growth and solid retention. U.S. and Canada delivered another exceptional quarter with underlying revenue growth of 16%. In international underlying growth was 9%, Latin America grew 12%, it's the best growth since the fourth quarter of 2015, Asia Pacific was up 9%, and EMEA was up 8%. For the first nine months of the year Marsh's revenue was 7.3 billion with underlying growth of 12%. U.S. and Canada underlying growth was 14% and international was up 9%.  Guy Carpenter's third quarter revenue was 314 million up 15% compared with the year ago on both the GAAP and underlying basis. Growth was broad based across geographies and specialties. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 7% or higher underlying growth in seven of the last nine quarters. In the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated 1.7 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth.  In the consulting segment revenue in the quarter was 1.9 billion up 13% from a year ago or 12% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 45% to 404 million. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to 350 million. The adjusted operating margin was 18.9% in line with the margin in the third quarter of 2020. Consulting generated revenue of 5.7 billion for the first nine months of 2021 representing underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 25% to 1.1 billion and the adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points to 19.6%.  Mercer's revenue was 1.3 billion in the quarter up 7% on an underlying basis, the highest result in over a decade. Career grew 13% on an underlying basis reflecting the continuing rebound in the global economy and business confidence. Wealth increased 6% on an underlying basis reflecting strong growth in investment management and modest growth in defined benefit. Our assets under delegated management grew to nearly 400 billion at the end of the third quarter up 24% year-over-year benefiting from net new inflows and market gains. Help underlying revenue growth was 4% in the quarter driven by growth outside the U.S.  Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was 610 million, an increase of 25% on an underlying basis. This represents the second consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth as demand remains strong across most geographies and practices. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was 1.8 billion, an increase of 21% on an underlying basis. Adjusted corporate expense was 60 million in the third quarter. Foreign exchange had a negligible impact on earnings in Q3. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels we expect FX to be a modest headwind in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was 69 million in the quarter and we expect it will remain at this level in the fourth quarter. Investment income was 13 million in the quarter on a GAAP basis and 12 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains on our private equity portfolio.  Interest expense in the third quarter was 107 million compared with 128 million in the third quarter of 2020 reflecting lower debt levels in the period. Based on our current forecast we expect interest expense in the fourth quarter to be similar to the amount in the third quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 24.4% compared with 26.5% in the third quarter last year. Our GAAP tax rate was 24.2% in the third quarter down from 30.3% in the third quarter of 2020 which was impacted by some unusual items. Through the first nine months of the year, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24.4% compared with 24.6% last year. Based on the current environment we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2021 excluding discrete items.  Given our year-to-date performance we are on track for an outstanding year. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter keep in mind that comparisons become more challenging given the rebound in growth in the fourth quarter of 2020. We also continue to build for the long-term by investing and hiring. While we are excited about the future benefit these investments will deliver, they come with upfront costs we absorb in the short-term. That said, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to deliver exceptional results today while investing for the future and expect we will continue to do so.  Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with 10.7 billion of total debt. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in January of 2022 when 500 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy at least 3.5 billion of capital in 2021 of which at least 3 billion will be deployed across dividends, acquisition, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchases will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops.  Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was 1.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled 665 million and included 272 million for dividends, 93 million for acquisitions, and 300 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months uses of cash totaled 2.6 billion and included 750 million for dividends, 566 million for acquisitions, 734 million for share repurchases, and 500 million for debt repayment. We had a remarkable third quarter positioning us well to deliver strong growth in both revenue and adjusted earnings in 2021 and with that I'm happy to turn it back to Dan. Thank you, Brian. Actually, we're really happy with free cash flow. Year-to-date, I think you have to be careful. There's a lot that can happen and cause volatility in a quarter with the cash flow statement even across the year. But free cash flow growth for us has been a great story over a long period of time and you go back over a decade. We've generated double-digit growth in free cash flow and we're up -- if you look year-to-date this year, we are up 5% and that's on top of 56% growth in free cash flow last year. So I think any growth above a big stair up last year is pretty good. So I think overall, our cash generation this year is strong and that's what's enabling us to deploy so much capital."

            "content": "Yeah, thanks John and indeed, wage inflation and inflation in general usually we do well in these times; one, because our clients really need help in managing these increased costs. So, how do they manage through medical inflation, which we believe is coming back now that regular care will resume which is intended to keep premium a bit low during COVID. The same thing on wage inflation looking at federating transformation program with clients to address the pyramid and the profiles of their workforce. And in terms of pension plans as well, I mean we have to watch on that. And as soon as there's pressures in the economy and system, governance spike up in terms of helping clients manage the asset side of their pension funds more tightly and therefore, that's usually good for the OCIO business in our investment management solutions. And lastly, from a management of our business, most if not all of our multi-year assignments would have a dramatic adjustment to inflation so we've seen that movie before, some years ago. Yeah, from a wage inflation point of view in the market, what we're seeing is that there's more pressure at the lower end of the wage spectrum, where there's a lot of movement there to attract people to jobs, that have been really hard hit during the pandemic. At the higher end of white collar professional, what we're seeing is a little bit of a musical chair, I would say. So there's a great resignation, there's quite a people have moved, people are looking for different careers. And we need to help our clients manage through these pressures and demand. But I think this element of it will be temporary and will settle itself over time. I mean, as clients look at -- as I said earlier, transforming, focusing on the skills they need rather than jobs and roles, we see a very important trend there. Dan has spoken earlier about our Skills-Edge platform that helped client migrate to that. These are all techniques that will help clients get through this change that we're seeing right now."

Second quarter 2021 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements.\nDan Glaser: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer, of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. I'd like to welcome Nick who became CEO of Oliver Wyman, July 1. Nick has led many of Oliver Wyman\u2019s major practices in his 23 years with the business and look forward to seeing Oliver Wyman continue to grow and thrive under his leadership. On behalf of the Executive Committee, I also want to thank Scott McDonald for his many contributions during his distinguished  career at the firm. Marsh & McLennan had an outstanding second quarter.  We have a well-positioned and benefiting from an abundance of opportunities. We are stronger and have broader capabilities .  benefiting from what may be the strongest economic rebound, nearly four decades led by our largest region, the U.S. There is high demand for our advice and solutions in this time of uncertainty and in the face of challenging market conditions.  We are seeing a  to quality and stability, which is contributing to high levels of business growth and client retention. And it's helping us attract talent. And there's a long runway for growth as we think about major protection gaps around the world, new emerging risks, digitization, workforce of the future and under penetrated market such as small commercial. We are focused on capitalizing on these opportunities and I am proud of our execution in the quarter. We generated record second quarter revenue and earnings, the best underlying growth of any quarter in two decades  for an excellent year. The strength of our results was brought based with each of our businesses and virtually all of our major geographies, seeing an acceleration in growth. Our adjusted EPS increased by an impressive 33% and we generated margin expansion despite challenging expense comparisons.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, Dan and good morning. Our results were excellent with record second quarter revenue earnings, the best quarterly underlying growth in two decades, meaningful margin expansion and significant growth in adjusted earnings. Highlights from our second quarter performance included the strongest underlying  since the first quarter of 2003, the strongest in Guy Carpenter in 15 years, solid rebound of 6% at Mercer, and record reported underlying growth in Oliver Wyman. Second quarter growth and adjusted earnings per share was also impressive, rising at the fastest pace of any quarter more than a decade. Consolidated revenue increased 20% in the second quarter to 5 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 13%. Operating income in the quarter was 1.2 billion, an increase of 39% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income increased 24% to 1.2 billion, and our adjusted operating margin increased  to 26.4%.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Mark, and operator we are ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the organic growth outlook, recognizing the comps do get a little bit harder in the second half of the year, but, you know, the Q3 was still negative last year. So, I guess my question is, given what you know now, sounds like you guys are positive, but a little bit cautious about the economy. You know, is it possible, it sounds like it's still possible, we could see double-digit organic growth over the remaining two quarters of the year?\nDan Glaser: So, we obviously, as Mark was saying, we've got momentum, and we feel very good about how we're positioned, and we're not that fearful about the economy. We are fearful about continuing waves of COVID, but, you know, the economies have adjusted somewhat in many parts of the world and are more resilient certainly than they were in the spring of 2020. And so the impact, economic impact won't be as severe as what we've seen, even with continuing waves of COVID. I mean, last quarter Elyse, we said that 2021 growth would be at the high-end of our 3% to 5% range and possibly higher. I think at 9% underlying growth through six months, it's safe to say that we're in the higher category. You know, we feel very good about our position. We're going to have a very good year. And 2021 is just going to set a new base for us. We intend to grow revenues and earnings in 2022 as well. So, this is not going to be a one-year wonder.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, that's helpful. And then my second question was on the margin side. So, you guys, you know, Dan, I think you both said that, you know, some T&E has not fully come back, but also, you know, the pretty impressive revenue growth helped drive that margin improvement as well. So, we think about the back half of the year and T&E coming back, can you just help us think through, you know, the resulting impact on the margins, especially if revenue remains strong, maybe the second half could also see some margin improvement?\nDan Glaser: Well, I'll start by saying that we absolutely expect margin expansion in the year, and this will be our 14th consecutive year of margin expansion. Margins are an outcome of how we run the business. I mean, we grow our revenue every year at a pace that's faster than how we grow our expenses. I think you may be overly optimistic about T&E really roaring back in the back half of this year. I think it's going to be very gradual, and slow, actually. And I think that companies, not just Marsh & McLennan will travel with more purpose and will be more thoughtful about traveling. And I think clients will expect the same of providers like ours.  And so, you know, we do expect and hope that over time, you know, T&E gets back to, kind of 2019 levels, but we may be quite a way away from that point-in-time. You know, we were very pleased with our margin expansion in the quarter. And as you said, that was driven by our top line like that's where it largely came from. And it helped us \u2013 that strong top line helped us overcome a comparable, which was a minus 5% expense . I mean, look at look at our \u2013  are up 30 bips, but that's on top of 430 bips margin expansion in the second quarter of last year. So, we like where we are. We will grow margins for the year. It may not be every quarter, don't know that right now, but ultimately we feel good for the year. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. So, just on organic growth, again, obviously you mentioned easy comps, were there any other tailwinds, such as maybe pent-up demand in certain industries or just the benefit of higher price hikes in PNC that might not repeat to the same extent in future periods?\nDan Glaser: Yeah. The high levels of growth were not just because of easy comps at all. I mean, Guy Carpenter\u2019s comp was a 9 last year, you know, March was a 1. So, it was not exactly layoffs in terms of comps. I think that the real momentum right now, and the U.S. economy is getting stronger,  is well behind us and the combined organization is emerging from the pandemic stronger than what we went in and focus on our front foot. New business generation was terrific across the businesses. And our growth was broad based. Retention is strong, pricing is a tailwind, and we're benefiting from disruption and flight to quality and stability. So, there are a lot of factors that are that are underpinning our revenue growth, and we feel very good about revenue growth into the future.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And then on share buybacks, I think you spent over 300 million in 2Q over 400 for the first half. And that's a higher pace than you typically did prior to the pandemic. So, is it more of a catch up from not buying back stock last year or is \u2013 should we assume this is going to be more of a run rate going forward?\nDan Glaser: We're not catching up with , every year is its own adventure. And ultimately, as we've said before, we start every period believing in a balanced approach to capital management, not that we'll spend the same money in each of our three principal buckets of dividend, and acquisition and share repurchase, but we don't have an approach that waited to one versus the other. And so share purchase in large part is a function of what our acquisition activity looks like, you know, every year might not be perfectly balanced, but the first half was pretty balanced.  I mean, our uses of 478 million of dividends, 434 of share repurchases, and 473 of acquisition. So, it is a balanced approach and I think you\u2019ll see that from us. I mean, at the end, as Mark was saying, we have 3.5 billion or more to deploy. We are a cash generation type of company. So, this is again, not a one-year wonder. This is an every year, we're going to put money toward our dividend. We're going to grow our dividend. We're going to acquire high quality firms and we're going to buy back our own shares. I mean that's going to be year-after-year.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay, thank you.\nDan Glaser: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit more about the expenses. Just the other operating expenses were up, you know, not as much as I would have thought. I mean, it sounds like T&E continues to be a benefit. That's not going to roar back, but still up only 6% year-over-year, despite a pretty favorable or pretty tough comp on the expense side. I'm wondering if there was anything else one off in there? And relatedly, I guess, you know, are you guys realizing more sustainable expense saves as a result of some of the operational changes due to COVID-19? Like, you know, real estate expense saves, and that sort of thing?\nDan Glaser: It's a good question, David. And we certainly are going to realize a number of efficiency gains over the next several years. And that's just, as you mentioned real estate more purposeful, T&E or traveling in general and hopefully  as well. Also, you know, we've been undergoing some significant modernization projects on technology and on operations, and so that \u2013 that will benefit us more in the future than it's doing right now. The biggest growth in our expenses frankly is compensation. And I think that's a good thing is, our variable cost is going up along with our growth.  We're in the market, we're hiring. I mean, the first six months of this year, our headcount has grown nearly 2000. Most of that is coming within Marsh, as they're capitalizing on the opportunity they see with their two biggest competitors having some element of distraction and uncertainty. So, you know, at the end, it's more expense related to headcount and expense related to compensation that's where the growth of expense is coming from. And we feel pretty good about that, you know, we can manage that over time. But we\u2019re in the market right now. You know, building our business and building on already the industry leading pool of talent we already have.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Yeah, that's good to hear. I guess maybe just a follow up on that headcount. I mean, I think, you know, that's the 2,000 headcount growth this year is definitely more than I was thinking where I had thought, how much of a \u2013 how much of a tail does that have? Like, you know, is that something that you think can continue through the end of the year or is, you know, is that something that, you know, you have like this, you know, period of time where the consolidation is, sort of in, there's some uncertainty there, and you guys are capitalizing on that? And then once that's over, it's, you know, sort of back to normal course, where you guys are still getting talent, it's just not as significant.\nDan Glaser : I think talent begets talent. You know, people are attracted to work in environments with smart, creative, dedicated people. And the more people like that you have the more talent you attract. It's clear that the issues of Willis in particular, in Aon, are creating a short-term opportunity that will run its course one way or the other. I mean, I was just looking at the stats recently are hiring from Aon and Willis post, the announcement is three times higher on a net basis than it was in the 16 months prior to the announcement. So that's not going to run forever, but ultimately, we're doing our best to continue to build  and capabilities within our already formidable firm. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. So, two questions I think related to what you were talking about. First, when you talk about the flight to stability, was that a headwind or a tailwind to margins in the quarter?\nDan Glaser : I think the flight to stability indicates that our account protection levels in our new business are higher than they otherwise would be. So, that would be a benefit in not only revenue, but a benefit to margins because the revenue is higher than it would otherwise be. It's not having an impact on expense.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. And then obviously, the reinsurance, organic growth has been fantastic for a long-time. There are, you know, it seems like there are a lot of new companies out there. I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on what's happening in the competitive environment?\nDan Glaser: You know, we're very pleased with Guy Carpenter\u2019s performance over a number of years, but I'll hand off to Peter so we can dig in a little bit deeper. So, Peter, you want to take that?\nPeter Hearn: Yeah. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Meyer. We have, we've enjoyed a terrific run over the past several years. Our model is, you know, based on consistent growth over a long period of time, and we're able to capitalize on that model, as a result of a very compelling proposition. Disciplined around both sales and pipeline that have resulted in new business wins, and as we look at our new business wins, over the past several quarters Meyer, the amount of new business coming from new clients, has grown significantly, to the extent that in Q2 2021, that number was 56% of our revenue growth from new business came from new clients. So, you know, we're seeing continued growth based on the model that we built. Yes, there are a number of new challenger brokers out there, and we have to be mindful, you know, all of our competitors are worthy adversaries. But we believe we have a very compelling proposition that over a long period of time has produced sustained growth and opportunity for us on a continuing basis.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, fantastic. Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Alright, thanks Meyer. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.\nBrian Meredith: Yeah, thanks. Two quick ones here. First one, Dan, I'm wondering if you could break down at Marsh? Just generally speaking, what the impact in organic revenue growth was from rate versus call exposure growth versus market share gains, just generally speaking?\nDan Glaser: If you can speak up just a little bit more? I got the question, but it was a little faint. I'll hand over to John, but, you know, I\u2019ll just start by saying how thrilled we all are with \u2013 in our 150th year anniversary at the company. We could grow the GAAP top line by 20%. In Marsh in particular,  best growth in a couple of decades. This is a phenomenal overall performance. But John, you want to break down the growth a bit?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Brian, thanks for the question. As Dan and Mark both mentioned, we certainly benefited from the economic rebound, relatively soft prior year , proud of that growth in the second quarter last year during the . The pricing environment, Dan talked about it a little bit in his remarks earlier, about 50% of our revenue is sensitive to PNC pricing. While rate increases have come down modestly, compared to the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, they held really where we're sensitive to pricings, where we get commission, but it's from a number of different areas. But I also want to emphasize that we executed really well in the quarter.  Our team is even as strong as it's ever been. They're highly engaged, focused on delivering for our clients. And the market remains challenging. It's, you know, again, while rates aren't nearly as much as they were before, they are quite difficult. I do think, you know, there's been a bit of catch up. You know, in some markets, there's a fair amount of new business. In our results, so whether it's in transaction risk in cyber or in construction, there are examples of where that is the case. But again, we're very pleased with the results in the quarter.\nDan Glaser: Anything else, Brian?\nBrian Meredith: Great. That's great. Thanks. And then the second question is, Dan can you talk a little bit about, kind of the M&A environment here, kind of what it looks like right now and also have the issues that Aon and Willis have kind of run into with some regulatory approvals, has that at all changed your kind of strategic view of M&A right now?\nDan Glaser: No. It had no impact. Our philosophy in M&A is basically we like buying firms that are high quality with a leadership team generally remains in place, and recurring revenue streams, high cash generation, low capital requirements, and a history of success that sets it up for us, and then it\u2019s really getting to know each other over a long stretch of time and figuring out, it's not us buying, and it's not them selling, we're deciding to come together. We believe the outcome for our clients and our people will be better together than separate. And that's the approach. Pipeline remains strong for us, throughout our businesses.  In fact, you know, last year was the highest acquired revenue within Marsh & McLennan agency, which as you know, has been more than a decade long, in terms of strategy building. So, we feel very good about that. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of capital in the world. So, you know, multiples are higher than what we would like. And we need to be very selective and very careful in our evaluation of pro forma results, because most of the companies we've looked at are private. But our strategy for a long period of time has been more of a string of pearls, not something where it is one mega type of acquisition, but it's building the company's capabilities.  Geographic have, you know,  JLT was an anomaly in some ways and it was perhaps our biggest acquisition in history. And  that acquisition, because we have been cultivating a broad relationship, for a long period of time. We were coming together, because we thought the combination was going to be better for clients, and you're seeing a manifestation of that. Growth is better, because of our combination with JLT, particularly in our specialty operation. And so, you know, that's, kind of where we are. Our thoughts on M&A have not changed.\nBrian Meredith: Great. Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess, just thinking about consulting, a couple of things. First of all, with Oliver Wyman, the 28 organic, just any color on I guess how you're thinking about that, any visibility on, sort of the back half of the year? And I guess, just within Mercer, it sounds it has been some focus on the call about comps becoming more difficult, is that obvious that the comps get that much more challenging there. So, I'm \u2013 maybe curious if you Martine could give us some perspective on, you know, sort of how business developed in the three months of the quarter and where we're at now, looking at the back half?\nDan Glaser: I\u2019m glad Ryan that you have, sort of consulted. It is a big part of our business and a big part of our performance, you know, and I'll hand it off to Nick first and then over to Martine, but let me just say a couple of comments first. One, we've mentioned before, that Oliver Wyman will tend to be our fastest grower over long stretches of time, but with more volatility. And so yeah, look back to the second quarter of last year minus 13. So, we love , but ultimately you put them together, and it's 6% over one of the more difficult periods in recent human history.  And so yeah, we tick the box on that. And that's a terrific result. Mercer on the other hand, Mercer is in terrific growth businesses, health, wealth, career, and you know, Martine does some great underpinning work. And if you go back to the end of 2019, you know 2% growth, 3% growth, and 4% growth in sequential quarters, and then 5% growth in the first quarter of 2020. And then got  the pandemic as expected in some ways, and held up very well with a minus 3 throughout last year. So, Martine and Mercer are going back to, you know, a terrific result in the second quarter. It is sort of getting back to the same pace or getting back to the same processes that existed pre-pandemic. Let's start with Nick, and then we'll go to Martine. Nick?\nNick Studer: Thank you very much. Yes, as Dan said, we're thrilled with the performance. And as to where it's coming from, it's in an incredibly broad base. The growth in the quarter was highest in the regions and the sectors, which have been most adversely affected by the pandemic and then referred to the comp. The Americas, particularly the U.S. have seen a very sharp rebound in client demand, both through the economic conditions and business confidence rising materially, and if you take, for example, the transportation sector, which was the sector that suffered the greatest impact from the pandemic last year, springing back very strongly.  While a lot of outsides of the Americas growth in Europe and in the Asia Pacific region were also quite robust. And across all major industry groups financial services, consumer industrial healthcare, all actually going remarkably at similar rates. And you know what we do think the outsized growth in Q2 was an outlier, we see business confidence remaining high, as global economic conditions improve, and we see even some semblance of return to normality in some of the places we operate. And it is also applied this in the labor market for the skill set that our consoles possess. So, we have a decent outlook for the business for the rest of the year.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Nick. Martine?\nMartine Ferland: Thanks for asking the question. Similar to Oliver Wyman the growth in the quarter really came all along the business and of the regions. But I think it's worth spending a moment  we have said through the pandemic, that this is where we have the most discretionary projects a little bit more connected to our Oliver Wyman would be operating. And it's absolutely come back. Times have restarted projects. There's a lot of demand out there. We\u2019ve been helping clients with their post pandemic workforce. There was a war for talent out there.  So, demand for rewards, demands for skills, and skill sets, assessment, engagement, transformation, as companies accelerate their  to digital and newer technology. So that is sustaining our  business. We see strong sales, good momentum for the rest of the year. And I want to spend another moment on our wealth business, I think 4% growth in the quarter is, we have not seen that since Q4 2017. Again, all  in our wealth business did well.  In particular, our OCIO business, which is the part of the business where we implement asset management for our clients. And you see the flight to strong governance there, deep manager research, and combined with questions and helping clients with ESG and , the type of investment in modeling and the life balance  comments a little bit. And lastly on wealth, this is the year where the DB cards of our portfolio which you all know is in structural decline, and for some years, actually because same size becomes smaller than investment management solution. And we have in a portfolio than we can see that this should be providing some tailwinds as we go beyond 2021.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Nick, thanks Martine.\nRyan Tunis: Thanks. Got it. And then just a follow-up for Dan and maybe John Doyle as well, can you just, I guess give us an update on the strategic importance of using wholesale brokers on the PNC side and maybe how that's evolved over time?\nDan Glaser: Yeah. I'll take it and hand it over to John. It\u2019s an interesting question. I think wholesale brokers in a lot of ways like the  in that, you know, they become quite specialists in a lot of different areas with some really good skills. Those are exactly what I think back in my career, what wholesale really meant 10 or 20 years ago. I think specialty placement might be more appropriate. But John, you want to talk about use of wholesalers?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. You know,  it's largely focused on specialty capabilities. And the most part we use wholesalers when we need to access certain markets, certain specialty insurance,  in particular, respect their distribution access to certain  brokers. For the most part that happens in the United States, almost no utilization for us. Like I say in the United States, risk kind of originated from the United States. To some extent it happens in the London marketplace as well, but we have a preferred a relationship with a couple of other specialty wholesalers and focus our efforts making sure we're delivering the same quality outcome for our clients that we came back from utilizing our own teams.\nDan Glaser: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning, and congrats on the quarter. My question is about the potential persistency of some of these market share gains. I'm thinking about back to the JLT acquisition and it seemed to me there was a little bit of drag on organic growth for about a year as things sort of moved through the system and the integration happened. Do you think there's a read through to, kind of what's happening for you on a positive sense today that as you hire these new people, it really takes, kind of a year for the full revenue impact and so that's kind of how we should think about the benefit of the flight to quality? It\u2019s kind of a year-by-year kind of effect?\nDan Glaser : Yeah, I would start Paul by saying, you know, we're an awfully big company. So, we make decisions to add to our talent, capability, and our broad capabilities, more generally, to build skill, content, etcetera. As opposed to necessarily saying, oh, that person is going to cost us this amount and we expect them to produce this amount over the course of the next couple of years. Your basic premise that will be to hire senior people that generally you expense first and then some revenue might come later.  Yeah, if the premise is true, as they get involved with the firm more broadly, but unlike some of the  firms, it's not just focused on, you know, this is a producer, this is what they think their book of businesses and you know, and we are buying, you know, that produce, that's just not how we operate. We're much more of a content culture building capabilities. But John what are your thoughts on that?\nJohn Doyle: The market shares is a hard thing to measure. I've read some estimates of personal insurance premiums will grow about 10% this year. So, if you use that as a proxy for the market then, you know then, yes, we cannot share. You know, I mentioned earlier, we're picking up some new business, you know  construction, primarily. Our win rates are up  when I look at the success in RFPs, it's up compared to historical levels, and the number of offensive RFPs, defensive RFPs is considerably better, which it's been passed. All I think speaks to the quality of the time. And at the same time, we're investing in talent that's going to drive the future growth. So, we\u2019re , we have good momentum, and we're excited about what that means for us .\nDan Glaser : Anything else, Paul?\nPaul Newsome: Yeah, just a little bit more on the market share, it looks like it came everywhere in terms of gains, in your businesses, is that really a fair sense? Or were there some benefits 0 business that you ?\nDan Glaser: This is the  of business growth that we've seen, certainly, since I've been at the company. And so it is occurring in many different spots. And I would put it down to that one of our fundamental growth market, risk strategy and people, you know, companies whether you're in a large account segment, the middle market segment, as a small segment, if you work for an organization or government, you have to focus on those three things. They're completely relevant to how you approach the business. We've got competitive advantages that starts with the quality of our people, our culture. Large capabilities that got even further gone in through the acquisitions we've done over the last number of years, most notably JLT. And our global footprint, those are competitive advantages.  We don't have a lot of competitors in any way that can match up to those advantages. And we continue to acquire best-in-class businesses. Our number one focus is on quality, and history of success. And so that's particularly in middle market brokerage. And we've got all kinds of opportunities. We spoke about cyber, and climate in our scripts, for digital, small commercial, you know, risk awareness in general is much higher. And so, you know, we're \u2013 as I've mentioned before, the pandemic maybe brought us closer than we ever were before. We're more connected. We're more collaborative than ever before. And we're leveraging our combined strengths like never before. So, all of those factors come together and we are a more formidable force in the market. And we're going to win business. And you know, that's going to continue.\nPaul Newsome: Thank you. That's great.\nDan Glaser: Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan for any closing remarks.\nDan Glaser: Okay. Well, that's a first. Okay, but I appreciate everyone joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 70,000 colleagues for their commitment, hard work, and dedication to Marsh & McLennan, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. I'd like to welcome Nick who became CEO of Oliver Wyman, July 1. Nick has led many of Oliver Wyman's major practices in his 23 years with the business and look forward to seeing Oliver Wyman continue to grow and thrive under his leadership. On behalf of the Executive Committee, I also want to thank Scott McDonald for his many contributions during his distinguished  career at the firm. Marsh & McLennan had an outstanding second quarter.  We have a well-positioned and benefiting from an abundance of opportunities. We are stronger and have broader capabilities .  benefiting from what may be the strongest economic rebound, nearly four decades led by our largest region, the U.S. There is high demand for our advice and solutions in this time of uncertainty and in the face of challenging market conditions.  We are seeing a  to quality and stability, which is contributing to high levels of business growth and client retention. And it's helping us attract talent. And there's a long runway for growth as we think about major protection gaps around the world, new emerging risks, digitization, workforce of the future and under penetrated market such as small commercial. We are focused on capitalizing on these opportunities and I am proud of our execution in the quarter. We generated record second quarter revenue and earnings, the best underlying growth of any quarter in two decades  for an excellent year. The strength of our results was brought based with each of our businesses and virtually all of our major geographies, seeing an acceleration in growth. Our adjusted EPS increased by an impressive 33% and we generated margin expansion despite challenging expense comparisons. Thanks Mark, and operator we are ready to begin Q&A. So, we obviously, as Mark was saying, we've got momentum, and we feel very good about how we're positioned, and we're not that fearful about the economy. We are fearful about continuing waves of COVID, but, you know, the economies have adjusted somewhat in many parts of the world and are more resilient certainly than they were in the spring of 2020. And so the impact, economic impact won't be as severe as what we've seen, even with continuing waves of COVID. I mean, last quarter Elyse, we said that 2021 growth would be at the high-end of our 3% to 5% range and possibly higher. I think at 9% underlying growth through six months, it's safe to say that we're in the higher category. You know, we feel very good about our position. We're going to have a very good year. And 2021 is just going to set a new base for us. We intend to grow revenues and earnings in 2022 as well. So, this is not going to be a one-year wonder. Well, I'll start by saying that we absolutely expect margin expansion in the year, and this will be our 14th consecutive year of margin expansion. Margins are an outcome of how we run the business. I mean, we grow our revenue every year at a pace that's faster than how we grow our expenses. I think you may be overly optimistic about T&E really roaring back in the back half of this year. I think it's going to be very gradual, and slow, actually. And I think that companies, not just Marsh & McLennan will travel with more purpose and will be more thoughtful about traveling. And I think clients will expect the same of providers like ours.  And so, you know, we do expect and hope that over time, you know, T&E gets back to, kind of 2019 levels, but we may be quite a way away from that point-in-time. You know, we were very pleased with our margin expansion in the quarter. And as you said, that was driven by our top line like that's where it largely came from. And it helped us \u2013 that strong top line helped us overcome a comparable, which was a minus 5% expense . I mean, look at look at our \u2013  are up 30 bips, but that's on top of 430 bips margin expansion in the second quarter of last year. So, we like where we are. We will grow margins for the year. It may not be every quarter, don't know that right now, but ultimately we feel good for the year. Next question please. Yeah. The high levels of growth were not just because of easy comps at all. I mean, Guy Carpenter's comp was a 9 last year, you know, March was a 1. So, it was not exactly layoffs in terms of comps. I think that the real momentum right now, and the U.S. economy is getting stronger,  is well behind us and the combined organization is emerging from the pandemic stronger than what we went in and focus on our front foot. New business generation was terrific across the businesses. And our growth was broad based. Retention is strong, pricing is a tailwind, and we're benefiting from disruption and flight to quality and stability. So, there are a lot of factors that are that are underpinning our revenue growth, and we feel very good about revenue growth into the future. We're not catching up with , every year is its own adventure. And ultimately, as we've said before, we start every period believing in a balanced approach to capital management, not that we'll spend the same money in each of our three principal buckets of dividend, and acquisition and share repurchase, but we don't have an approach that waited to one versus the other. And so share purchase in large part is a function of what our acquisition activity looks like, you know, every year might not be perfectly balanced, but the first half was pretty balanced.  I mean, our uses of 478 million of dividends, 434 of share repurchases, and 473 of acquisition. So, it is a balanced approach and I think you'll see that from us. I mean, at the end, as Mark was saying, we have 3.5 billion or more to deploy. We are a cash generation type of company. So, this is again, not a one-year wonder. This is an every year, we're going to put money toward our dividend. We're going to grow our dividend. We're going to acquire high quality firms and we're going to buy back our own shares. I mean that's going to be year-after-year. Next question please. It's a good question, David. And we certainly are going to realize a number of efficiency gains over the next several years. And that's just, as you mentioned real estate more purposeful, T&E or traveling in general and hopefully  as well. Also, you know, we've been undergoing some significant modernization projects on technology and on operations, and so that \u2013 that will benefit us more in the future than it's doing right now. The biggest growth in our expenses frankly is compensation. And I think that's a good thing is, our variable cost is going up along with our growth.  We're in the market, we're hiring. I mean, the first six months of this year, our headcount has grown nearly 2000. Most of that is coming within Marsh, as they're capitalizing on the opportunity they see with their two biggest competitors having some element of distraction and uncertainty. So, you know, at the end, it's more expense related to headcount and expense related to compensation that's where the growth of expense is coming from. And we feel pretty good about that, you know, we can manage that over time. But we're in the market right now. You know, building our business and building on already the industry leading pool of talent we already have. I think talent begets talent. You know, people are attracted to work in environments with smart, creative, dedicated people. And the more people like that you have the more talent you attract. It's clear that the issues of Willis in particular, in Aon, are creating a short-term opportunity that will run its course one way or the other. I mean, I was just looking at the stats recently are hiring from Aon and Willis post, the announcement is three times higher on a net basis than it was in the 16 months prior to the announcement. So that's not going to run forever, but ultimately, we're doing our best to continue to build  and capabilities within our already formidable firm. Next question please. I think the flight to stability indicates that our account protection levels in our new business are higher than they otherwise would be. So, that would be a benefit in not only revenue, but a benefit to margins because the revenue is higher than it would otherwise be. It's not having an impact on expense. You know, we're very pleased with Guy Carpenter's performance over a number of years, but I'll hand off to Peter so we can dig in a little bit deeper. So, Peter, you want to take that? Alright, thanks Meyer. Next question please. If you can speak up just a little bit more? I got the question, but it was a little faint. I'll hand over to John, but, you know, I'll just start by saying how thrilled we all are with \u2013 in our 150th year anniversary at the company. We could grow the GAAP top line by 20%. In Marsh in particular,  best growth in a couple of decades. This is a phenomenal overall performance. But John, you want to break down the growth a bit? Anything else, Brian? No. It had no impact. Our philosophy in M&A is basically we like buying firms that are high quality with a leadership team generally remains in place, and recurring revenue streams, high cash generation, low capital requirements, and a history of success that sets it up for us, and then it's really getting to know each other over a long stretch of time and figuring out, it's not us buying, and it's not them selling, we're deciding to come together. We believe the outcome for our clients and our people will be better together than separate. And that's the approach. Pipeline remains strong for us, throughout our businesses.  In fact, you know, last year was the highest acquired revenue within Marsh & McLennan agency, which as you know, has been more than a decade long, in terms of strategy building. So, we feel very good about that. I mean, obviously, there's a lot of capital in the world. So, you know, multiples are higher than what we would like. And we need to be very selective and very careful in our evaluation of pro forma results, because most of the companies we've looked at are private. But our strategy for a long period of time has been more of a string of pearls, not something where it is one mega type of acquisition, but it's building the company's capabilities.  Geographic have, you know,  JLT was an anomaly in some ways and it was perhaps our biggest acquisition in history. And  that acquisition, because we have been cultivating a broad relationship, for a long period of time. We were coming together, because we thought the combination was going to be better for clients, and you're seeing a manifestation of that. Growth is better, because of our combination with JLT, particularly in our specialty operation. And so, you know, that's, kind of where we are. Our thoughts on M&A have not changed. Next question please. I'm glad Ryan that you have, sort of consulted. It is a big part of our business and a big part of our performance, you know, and I'll hand it off to Nick first and then over to Martine, but let me just say a couple of comments first. One, we've mentioned before, that Oliver Wyman will tend to be our fastest grower over long stretches of time, but with more volatility. And so yeah, look back to the second quarter of last year minus 13. So, we love , but ultimately you put them together, and it's 6% over one of the more difficult periods in recent human history.  And so yeah, we tick the box on that. And that's a terrific result. Mercer on the other hand, Mercer is in terrific growth businesses, health, wealth, career, and you know, Martine does some great underpinning work. And if you go back to the end of 2019, you know 2% growth, 3% growth, and 4% growth in sequential quarters, and then 5% growth in the first quarter of 2020. And then got  the pandemic as expected in some ways, and held up very well with a minus 3 throughout last year. So, Martine and Mercer are going back to, you know, a terrific result in the second quarter. It is sort of getting back to the same pace or getting back to the same processes that existed pre-pandemic. Let's start with Nick, and then we'll go to Martine. Nick? Thanks Nick. Martine? Thanks Nick, thanks Martine. Yeah. I'll take it and hand it over to John. It's an interesting question. I think wholesale brokers in a lot of ways like the  in that, you know, they become quite specialists in a lot of different areas with some really good skills. Those are exactly what I think back in my career, what wholesale really meant 10 or 20 years ago. I think specialty placement might be more appropriate. But John, you want to talk about use of wholesalers? Next question please. Yeah, I would start Paul by saying, you know, we're an awfully big company. So, we make decisions to add to our talent, capability, and our broad capabilities, more generally, to build skill, content, etcetera. As opposed to necessarily saying, oh, that person is going to cost us this amount and we expect them to produce this amount over the course of the next couple of years. Your basic premise that will be to hire senior people that generally you expense first and then some revenue might come later.  Yeah, if the premise is true, as they get involved with the firm more broadly, but unlike some of the  firms, it's not just focused on, you know, this is a producer, this is what they think their book of businesses and you know, and we are buying, you know, that produce, that's just not how we operate. We're much more of a content culture building capabilities. But John what are your thoughts on that? Anything else, Paul? This is the  of business growth that we've seen, certainly, since I've been at the company. And so it is occurring in many different spots. And I would put it down to that one of our fundamental growth market, risk strategy and people, you know, companies whether you're in a large account segment, the middle market segment, as a small segment, if you work for an organization or government, you have to focus on those three things. They're completely relevant to how you approach the business. We've got competitive advantages that starts with the quality of our people, our culture. Large capabilities that got even further gone in through the acquisitions we've done over the last number of years, most notably JLT. And our global footprint, those are competitive advantages.  We don't have a lot of competitors in any way that can match up to those advantages. And we continue to acquire best-in-class businesses. Our number one focus is on quality, and history of success. And so that's particularly in middle market brokerage. And we've got all kinds of opportunities. We spoke about cyber, and climate in our scripts, for digital, small commercial, you know, risk awareness in general is much higher. And so, you know, we're \u2013 as I've mentioned before, the pandemic maybe brought us closer than we ever were before. We're more connected. We're more collaborative than ever before. And we're leveraging our combined strengths like never before. So, all of those factors come together and we are a more formidable force in the market. And we're going to win business. And you know, that's going to continue. Next question. Okay. Well, that's a first. Okay, but I appreciate everyone joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 70,000 colleagues for their commitment, hard work, and dedication to Marsh & McLennan, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Sure. Brian, thanks for the question. As Dan and Mark both mentioned, we certainly benefited from the economic rebound, relatively soft prior year , proud of that growth in the second quarter last year during the . The pricing environment, Dan talked about it a little bit in his remarks earlier, about 50% of our revenue is sensitive to PNC pricing. While rate increases have come down modestly, compared to the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, they held really where we're sensitive to pricings, where we get commission, but it's from a number of different areas. But I also want to emphasize that we executed really well in the quarter.  Our team is even as strong as it's ever been. They're highly engaged, focused on delivering for our clients. And the market remains challenging. It's, you know, again, while rates aren't nearly as much as they were before, they are quite difficult. I do think, you know, there's been a bit of catch up. You know, in some markets, there's a fair amount of new business. In our results, so whether it's in transaction risk in cyber or in construction, there are examples of where that is the case. But again, we're very pleased with the results in the quarter. Sure. You know,  it's largely focused on specialty capabilities. And the most part we use wholesalers when we need to access certain markets, certain specialty insurance,  in particular, respect their distribution access to certain  brokers. For the most part that happens in the United States, almost no utilization for us. Like I say in the United States, risk kind of originated from the United States. To some extent it happens in the London marketplace as well, but we have a preferred a relationship with a couple of other specialty wholesalers and focus our efforts making sure we're delivering the same quality outcome for our clients that we came back from utilizing our own teams. The market shares is a hard thing to measure. I've read some estimates of personal insurance premiums will grow about 10% this year. So, if you use that as a proxy for the market then, you know then, yes, we cannot share. You know, I mentioned earlier, we're picking up some new business, you know  construction, primarily. Our win rates are up  when I look at the success in RFPs, it's up compared to historical levels, and the number of offensive RFPs, defensive RFPs is considerably better, which it's been passed. All I think speaks to the quality of the time. And at the same time, we're investing in talent that's going to drive the future growth. So, we're , we have good momentum, and we're excited about what that means for us ."

            "content": "Thank you very much. Yes, as Dan said, we're thrilled with the performance. And as to where it's coming from, it's in an incredibly broad base. The growth in the quarter was highest in the regions and the sectors, which have been most adversely affected by the pandemic and then referred to the comp. The Americas, particularly the U.S. have seen a very sharp rebound in client demand, both through the economic conditions and business confidence rising materially, and if you take, for example, the transportation sector, which was the sector that suffered the greatest impact from the pandemic last year, springing back very strongly.  While a lot of outsides of the Americas growth in Europe and in the Asia Pacific region were also quite robust. And across all major industry groups financial services, consumer industrial healthcare, all actually going remarkably at similar rates. And you know what we do think the outsized growth in Q2 was an outlier, we see business confidence remaining high, as global economic conditions improve, and we see even some semblance of return to normality in some of the places we operate. And it is also applied this in the labor market for the skill set that our consoles possess. So, we have a decent outlook for the business for the rest of the year."

Our model is, you know, based on consistent growth over a long period of time, and we're able to capitalize on that model, as a result of a very compelling proposition. Disciplined around both sales and pipeline that have resulted in new business wins, and as we look at our new business wins, over the past several quarters Meyer, the amount of new business coming from new clients, has grown significantly, to the extent that in Q2 2021, that number was 56% of our revenue growth from new business came from new clients. So, you know, we're seeing continued growth based on the model that we built. Yes, there are a number of new challenger brokers out there, and we have to be mindful, you know, all of our competitors are worthy adversaries. But we believe we have a very compelling proposition that over a long period of time has produced sustained growth and opportunity for us on a continuing basis."

Our results were excellent with record second quarter revenue earnings, the best quarterly underlying growth in two decades, meaningful margin expansion and significant growth in adjusted earnings. Highlights from our second quarter performance included the strongest underlying  since the first quarter of 2003, the strongest in Guy Carpenter in 15 years, solid rebound of 6% at Mercer, and record reported underlying growth in Oliver Wyman. Second quarter growth and adjusted earnings per share was also impressive, rising at the fastest pace of any quarter more than a decade. Consolidated revenue increased 20% in the second quarter to 5 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 13%. Operating income in the quarter was 1.2 billion, an increase of 39% over the prior year. Adjusted operating income increased 24% to 1.2 billion, and our adjusted operating margin increased  to 26.4%."

            "content": "Thanks for asking the question. Similar to Oliver Wyman the growth in the quarter really came all along the business and of the regions. But I think it's worth spending a moment  we have said through the pandemic, that this is where we have the most discretionary projects a little bit more connected to our Oliver Wyman would be operating. And it's absolutely come back. Times have restarted projects. There's a lot of demand out there. We've been helping clients with their post pandemic workforce. There was a war for talent out there.  So, demand for rewards, demands for skills, and skill sets, assessment, engagement, transformation, as companies accelerate their  to digital and newer technology. So that is sustaining our  business. We see strong sales, good momentum for the rest of the year. And I want to spend another moment on our wealth business, I think 4% growth in the quarter is, we have not seen that since Q4 2017. Again, all  in our wealth business did well.  In particular, our OCIO business, which is the part of the business where we implement asset management for our clients. And you see the flight to strong governance there, deep manager research, and combined with questions and helping clients with ESG and , the type of investment in modeling and the life balance  comments a little bit. And lastly on wealth, this is the year where the DB cards of our portfolio which you all know is in structural decline, and for some years, actually because same size becomes smaller than investment management solution. And we have in a portfolio than we can see that this should be providing some tailwinds as we go beyond 2021."

First quarter 2021 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at mmc.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements, including certain expectations related to COVID-19 and other matters. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh & McLennan website.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh & McLennan had an outstanding start to 2021. Our first quarter results were excellent, and we are well positioned for a very good year. Even though the pandemic is ongoing, our underlying revenue growth of 6% is the highest in over 6 years and accelerated sequentially across every business. We also grew adjusted EPS by 21% and generated significant margin expansion. Our business has proven resilient throughout the pandemic. And with the global economy now beginning to turn the corner, we saw an acceleration in our growth. With 6% underlying growth to begin the year, we now expect full year 2021 underlying revenue growth to be at the high end of our 3% to 5% guidance range and possibly above. As we look ahead, the outlook for the U.S. and many of the countries we operate in is encouraging. However, many parts of the world continue to suffer with high levels of infection, and there is still a significant amount of uncertainty. GDP in the U.S. was close to flat in the first quarter and strong levels of growth are expected, starting in the second quarter, due to a rebound in demand as the impact of vaccines takes hold, along with favorable economic comparisons to a year ago. Meanwhile, in India, Brazil and many other parts of the world, case counts continue to rise and broad levels of vaccination remain a long way off. Our proprietary pandemic navigator now forecasts that the U.S. will achieve the herd immunity threshold by early to mid-summer, and we see a fairly similar time line in the UK. These milestones bring hope for reopening and economic growth, although it will vary by country. We are also mindful that the risk exists and that there still are many unknowns, such as variance of the virus, the efficacy of vaccines on the variants, the duration of immunity and vaccine hesitancy. But we are resilient and are confident we will be able to adapt to a wide range of scenarios, just as we have since the beginning of this crisis.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our first quarter results were outstanding, and we are well positioned for a very good 2021 despite the continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic. Underlying growth accelerated across all of our businesses, and our margin expansion and earnings growth were impressive. Consolidated revenue increased 9% in the first quarter to $5.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 6%. Operating income and adjusted operating income were both approximately $1.4 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points to 29.6%, GAAP EPS was $1.91, and adjusted EPS was $1.99, up 21% compared with the first quarter a year ago. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services. First quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, up 11% compared with the year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This marks the highest level of underlying growth since 2012. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $1.1 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 36.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, up 13% compared with a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. This was Marsh's highest level of underlying growth in nearly 2 decades. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and driven by double-digit new business growth and solid retention and was impressive considering Marsh's strong growth in the first quarter of last year. The U.S. and Canada division delivered another exceptional quarter, with underlying revenue growth of 9%. This is the highest quarterly underlying growth U.S. and Canada has achieved since we began reporting their results, and they have now averaged 6% underlying growth over the last 12 quarters. In international, underlying growth was strong at 6%, marking the highest underlying growth since 2013. EMEA was up 6%, with strong results in each region, including in the UK. Asia Pacific was up 8%, a strong rebound from the fourth quarter and comes on top of 6% growth in the first quarter of 2020. And Latin America grew 6% on an underlying basis, continuing to show sequential improvement. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $895 million, up 8% or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in North America, EMEA, Global Specialties and Latin America Treaty. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in 12 of the last 14 quarters. In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 6% from a year ago or 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $370 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded by 330 basis points to 20.5%.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, great, good morning. First question, thinking about some of your comments about organic growth, so this quarter, clearly, excellent 6%. I believe, Dan, you said that for the full year, you could potentially be over the guide. And you also said you expected Mercer\u2019s organic growth levels to improve in 2Q. So if I understood correctly, then I think it implies that there might be some deceleration in parts of the business in later quarters. So maybe just kind of curious, were there any kind of one-time items in nature or things we should be thinking about in the back half of the year that could show less positive momentum?\nDan Glaser: Sure. So, why don\u2019t I take that to begin with, and then I will hand off to each of our business leaders, so they can talk a little bit about their growth prospects and how they looked at the quarter and what they are looking at going forward. I would just start by saying we have got real momentum right now. I mean the U.S. economy is getting stronger. The JLT integration is well behind us, and the combined organization is emerging from the pandemic strong, focused and on our front foot. New business generation was terrific across the business and in particular, at Marsh and Oliver Wyman. So when Scott and John speak, they can talk to you a little bit about their new business. But overall, retention was strong, growth was broad based. On the RIS side, pricing is a tailwind, and we are benefiting from some disruption in flight to quality. That said, Mike, there is nothing one-off or unusual about our results. So, we are not really going to get into, in coming quarters, do we expect a deceleration. Obviously, as Mark was saying, we start to get some easier comps on the top line and some tougher comps on the expense line, but it will play itself out, and we expect to have a very strong year. But why don\u2019t we start with Marsh, and John to just talk about growth a little bit. John?\nJohn Doyle: Thanks Dan. Mike, as Dan noted, nothing particularly one-off in nature about the growth in the quarter. I was very pleased with the start to the year. Mark gave a bit of an around the world view in his prepared remarks. But just a little bit more color. Specialty growth was particularly strong in the quarter, in FINPRO, in our private equity practice, construction and energy, also very, very strong results in the quarter. We had good growth in benefits. Our MGA and affinity operations also had a good quarter. So, I was quite pleased with it. I think we executed well for sure. Dan talked about our new business. The renewal line was strong as well. We are very, very focused in what\u2019s still a very difficult market for our clients. But I think we are positioned well. And as Dan noted, the economy is picking up in some important markets for us. There is still obviously some uncertainty as Dan and Mark both noted in the macros, but I am very, very pleased with the start to the year.\nDan Glaser: Thanks, John. Let me go to Peter for a couple of minutes. Peter, Guy Carpenter has grown considerably and consistently over a number of years now. But Peter, what are you thinking about growth right now?\nPeter Hearn: Thanks Dan. Mike, our model is consistent growth over a long period of time. I think we have demonstrated that, as Dan said. We do benefit from the rate increases that are going on in the market. But the bulk of our income is coming from new business wins, and it\u2019s well balanced across all of our businesses from North America, Latin America, Middle East, Asia Pac, global specialties, all have recognized strong growth in the first quarter, and we see the same holding true for Q2. Now Q3s tend to be very small quarters for us. So, there is more volatility inherent in them. But over the past few years, we have shown once again that even with smaller quarters, based on the disciplined approach we had to new business and the approach of growing in any market condition, we have demonstrated our ability to grow.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Peter. Mike, you mentioned Mercer. So Martine, you want to talk about growth at Mercer?\nMartine Ferland: Yes. Sure, Dan. We are very pleased with our quarterly \u2013 quarter 1 2021 results, especially since we were facing a comparison of 5% growth same quarter last year. We have seen increased demand in our services, sequential revenue growth months-to-months during the quarter and a return to growth actually in March. We know that during the pandemic, clients have postponed discretionary work due to uncertainty and also employment levels have dropped. But now we expect tailwinds from economic and job growth partially offset, of course, by the continued structural decline in the client benefit. But clearly, we see a return to growth for the rest of the year, starting with Q2. In terms of demands, our investment business, investment management business, in particular, with lots of demand in the alternative space, and ESG and being seemed investment opportunities is strong. We started the year with strong inflow. Demand for digital solutions around the whole of business is also strong. Health has been resilient through the pandemic, and we see lots of demand in our Darwin health platform and global benefit management. And we have seen quite a good uptick in Korea as well with demand for engagement surveys, transformation of the workplace, return to a new normal redefinition of the way to work. So overall, it looks like a strong rest of the year for Mercer.\nDan Glaser: Okay. Thanks Martine. So, we have often said how Oliver Wyman is a bit more sensitive to business confidence, economic outlook, etcetera. And their strong growth actually bodes very well for the company overall. But Scott, do you want to talk a little bit about Oliver Wyman and how you see at least the quarter and the next couple of quarters?\nScott McDonald: Yes. Happy to round out on growth for us. So, we had a really strong quarter, as you saw. I think that is driven by business confidence across really all of our sectors, particularly strong growth in the U.S. and Europe. And the growth was really widespread across all the types of business we do, whether that was a growth strategy, digital or technology transformation, some restructuring and in new areas like climate and sustainability. So, it felt really healthy. I think though, Mike, given the volatility in our business, it\u2019s just important to maintain a long-term perspective. And we continue to be able to think we can grow the business at mid to high-single digits over the long-term. In the shorter term, with the current robust demand, the strong new sales, combined with the weaker performance from last year, we may exceed that long-term target in any quarter and possibly for the year overall.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Scott. So Mike, I know that was a lot, but I figured there would be a lot of questions on growth we might as well go around the horn and hear from our business leaders. So anything else, Mike?\nMike Zaremski: Yes, that was great. And one last quick follow-up, I believe you \u2013 Dan, you said the Marsh pricing index came in at 18%, down a little bit from 22% quarter-over-quarter. I think some investors may want to focus on that stat. So, I just wanted to get maybe potentially some more color. Pricing clearly is a tailwind. I know you said that, but I believe the majority and maybe vast majority of your revenues are on a fee basis. So, I think the beta in terms of kind of sensitivity to pricing, It\u2019s not as influential as other brokers that are maybe more commission based. I am trying to \u2013 maybe if you can give any color around how to think about the deceleration in pricing? Thanks.\nDan Glaser: Sure. And let\u2019s just be clear. We are on the client side of the table. So, these are \u2013 even at an 18% deceleration from 22% in the quarter sequentially, these are trying times for our clients and Marsh brokers are working really hard to put together the best package, the best solutions in the circumstances. John, you want to talk a little bit about commission versus fee and the impact of the rating environment on your overall growth just, in general terms?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Mike, about 60% of our revenue is commission based, but about 50% of Marsh\u2019s total revenue is exposed P&C pricing, right. So we have commission in the benefit side as well in some markets. So as Dan noted, it\u2019s still a very, very difficult market for our clients. And obviously, an uneven economy for so many of our clients. And so our clients, of course, are adapting to that. Some in this market and certainly throughout 2020, we are choosing to retain some more risks, whether it\u2019s through higher retentions or lower limits. Our captive management business is experiencing pretty strong growth as well as an indicator of maybe how our clients are reacting to the market. But it\u2019s still a difficult market. The D&O market, the excess casualty market in the U.S. and the cyber markets remain the most challenging. On the other hand, the work comp pricing continues to be pretty favorable for our clients and was modestly down. Pricing was modestly down in that product area here in the United States. So, the underwriting community is clearly concerned about elevated cat activity was obviously a busy cat quarter in the United States in the first quarter. The word lost cost inflation, lower interest rates, but my expectations is that we will continue to see some moderation of price increases throughout the rest of the year. Again, I expect prices to be up year-over-year, but I do expect them to be up somewhat less than they get up in recent quarters.\nDan Glaser: Thanks John. Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, my first question, digging into another topic, expenses. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned continued low T&E in the first quarter. You also mentioned, right, some tougher comps year-over-year. And then obviously, once we get towards herd immunity, right, we could start to see somewhat of a pickup in T&E. But can you just help us think through the expenses? Any sense of how we should think about kind of run rate when we kind of get through COVID in terms of what says you can guys can kind of potentially keep on an ongoing basis?\nDan Glaser: Sure. So at least many companies, including Marsh & McLennan reduced expenses significantly, particularly in the second quarter and third quarter. And as you know, last year, we started coming back. It had positive expense growth in the fourth quarter because we did some hiring and that sort of thing. The largest reductions were in T&E and our view is that will be a gradual comeback. We believe people will travel with more purpose and more for thought than pre-pandemic, and we are certainly going to encourage that within the company. We are going to try to get away from the \u2013 anytime anywhere, hop on an airplane culture and pause and say, okay, there are important times where you go visit a client or you go visit a market. That\u2019s absolutely to be sure. But we have proven that we can operate effectively remotely. And so we want to create that a little bit of pause and say, \u201cCan I do this?\u201d via a remote access like a Zoom or Teams, etcetera. And so it also is important for us in terms of as we manage our carbon footprint going forward, and it\u2019s important for other companies, I think to act in a similar fashion. So, now one thing that let\u2019s not lose sight of, even though there may be some pressure as some expenses start to come back, as we go through the year. That\u2019s actually good news. That means that the world is recovering, the economy is recovering that means business is getting back to normal, that has growth implications for us. And longer term, we have learned a lot during this pandemic period, and we believe we can be a leaner, more agile organization. And that has implications. That means that while the office is core to our culture, and is a central part of how we operate, we know we can operate with more flexibility and more agility than we have done in the past. And longer term, that has implications for our real estate expense, which are quite heavy. And so I would expect that we will be able to get some savings there over time. Do you have another question, Elyse?\nElyse Greenspan: Yes. Thank you. And then my second question on the capital side of things, you guys alluded to, right, you did one deal in the Q1. My sense is that we are kind of seeing a little bit of a slowdown around some broker deals just as we \u2013 I think the expectation, right, that we could see a pickup later on in the year when there is certainty around tax reform. So, I guess I wanted to see if you guys kind of agreed with that when you were thinking through the capital plan for the year? And then did you say where we are in that $3.5 billion as of the end of Q1?\nDan Glaser: Sure. So a couple of things, and then I will hand over to Mark. I mean overall, just to bear in mind that PayneWest is April 1. So that was not a first quarter item. It\u2019s beginning of the second quarter. But we wanted to call it out because it\u2019s an important acquisition for the company. We have been at it for 150 years, and we have been acquiring firms for that entire period of time. Let\u2019s not forget Henry Marsh and Donald McLennan came together and formed Marsh & McLennan. And so we don\u2019t pay much attention to what\u2019s happening to the tax rate, capital gains or what interest rates are because we are not looking for companies to combine with and to join us who really are just playing the economics. We cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. We almost always for our important acquisitions are in exclusive discussions with the other company. And we are coming together because we see value on both sides. We can grow better together. We can serve clients better together, etcetera. And so I don\u2019t believe that we don\u2019t have a budget around acquisitions. We go through our process and what happens, happens as we go through. But ultimately, let me hand to Mark and he can talk about capital management more broadly and what we have available for this year and our expectations of how we would likely use it. But Mark?\nMark McGivney: Thanks Dan. So Elyse, let me just run you through. So we still expect, as you said, roughly $3.5 billion of capital deployed this year, and I will just run you through the math of how that breaks down. We have already spent the $0.5 billion that we had targeted on deleveraging. So as I mentioned earlier, we pulled forward our July debt repayment. Dividends will run around $1 billion, and that leaves $2 billion of that $3.5 billion available for M&A and share repurchase. Dan mentioned that we closed our PayneWest, which was a chunky deal. And our M&A pipeline remains full. It\u2019s always hard to predict how much we will actually do. But our hope is that we see a meaningful amount of M&A this year. But we also expect that we will see a meaningful amount of share repurchase, at least enough to see our share count go down this year.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Mark. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Thanks. Good morning and looking at the organic growth, I guess for international, in particular, I was surprised that the strength just given how it feels like the vaccination rates and the impact of COVID is still a bit of a headwind there. I was hoping you could talk about the potential that the different regions have to the rollout of the take-up rate of vaccinations and how we think about economic development and it might be trailing. Could there be slowdowns coming as we see fourth waves that we are fortunately not going to get in the U.S.?\nDan Glaser: Yes. I mean, we had good international growth overall in the company, both in Marsh, but also on OW and Guy Carpenter as well. And Mercer had sequential growth. So overall, I mean I would also bear in mind that over the last couple of years, we have digested the biggest acquisition in our history, and that had some headwind with us as well in terms of revenue growth. And we have seen \u2013 and disruption. So, we have seen a nice comeback in places like Latin America and also in Asia Pac than what we have been experiencing for the last year or so. But the big winner, in terms of turnaround, was UK. John, you want to talk about your business in the UK a little bit?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Dan. Phil, as you noted, there, of course, will be ups and downs on a global basis in any kind of normal economy. And obviously, we are still recovering and still in the pandemic, as Dan noted in his prepared remarks earlier. But I was very, very pleased with our performance in the quarter in the UK. It\u2019s been a bit of a stress point for us over the last 18 months or so. Some of it related to just indigestion from coming together with JLT and some headwinds there. But we saw good growth, a lot of it from our middle marketing UK business, but also in the specialty areas, as I noted before, particularly strong growth in our financial lines business. The D&O market, as I said earlier, is difficult for our clients, very, very meaningful cyber growth in the UK and construction and energy were off to a terrific start. Elsewhere in the world, I think just another bright spot to point out, we saw very, very good new business growth in Australia. So, I was quite pleased with that. So yes, it was an improved performance by the international team, and we expect continued good momentum.\nDan Glaser: Anything else, Phil?\nPhil Stefano: Yes. I have then a follow-up on the M&A discussion from earlier. Dan, you had mentioned when you buy things, you tend to be kind of the sole buyer at the table. I am sure there is a political way to ask this, but I am just going to be direct, so apologies. But Aon and Willis is going through a transaction, and it feels like there is going to be some businesses that come out of this that ultimately need to be divested. As I think about your global position, can you be involved in the process, right? Not whether or not you choose to be and anything is going to happen, but just given your size, is this a process you can be involved in? And can you take a look at kind of what\u2019s being shopped?\nDan Glaser: I mean, I think the general idea of divestment would be to satisfy regulators\u2019 concerns about having enough competitors in the marketplace. So, it would be unusual for them to look to us as a possible answer. I mean we are open to all ideas, but ultimately, I think it\u2019s unlikely that we would be a participant in all a very small area in that kind of vein. Now having said that, there are plenty of very good, high quality firms that we are in discussions with. And so when we look at our M&A pipeline, we look over the course of years, not over the course of months, and we have got a very rich pipeline of companies that we are having discussions with. So, we feel very good about our ability to continue to add to the strength. And I would just use that as a backdrop to growth in general. Like we generally feel that underlying growth is the most important measure to evaluate the health of the overall organization. So, our focus is generally on underlying growth. But every once in a while, you have to look at GAAP, what\u2019s the company doing on an overall basis. And if I just look at RIS, as an example, first quarter last year, we grew a very big organization on a GAAP basis, 20%, and followed up in this first quarter by an 11% on top of the 20% on a GAAP basis. We are significantly growing the organization. And on the consulting side, it was more like a 5% on GAAP last year, followed by a 6% this year on GAAP. So we are having good underlying performance, but we are also having a much larger organization and growing a much larger organization. Next question, please, operator.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi, good morning. Most of my questions were answered, but a couple of points. First, on the deal environment, can you talk about competition for deals, especially sort of small and mid-sized deals? It seems like valuations have steadily gone up over the past few years. And then on pricing, you spoke about sort of a slowdown in reinsurance and a slowdown in overall \u2013 in your index. Can you talk a little bit more detail about lines of where you have seen the most noticeable change over the past 3 months, up or down?\nDan Glaser: Okay. So I will talk about your M&A point, and then I will hand off to John and Peter Hearn, so they can talk a little bit about the rate environment and a little bit more debt, although that\u2019s really inside baseball. Ultimately, when we look at deals, as I mentioned before, we are not chasing any deals. Your conclusion that multiples have gone up over the last number of years is absolutely true. Multiples are higher, which means we should be more selective. And it means that we should understand the pro forma calculations in a deep way, because most of these organizations are private. So, the pro forma results are far different than the actual results over the previous years and there can be a disconnect in terms of what expectations are versus the reality of a performing business. Now, our goal is actually to buy high quality firms. That\u2019s our primary goal. Firms that match our culture, where there is good chemistry, where the leaders plan to stay in the business and keep growing the business. And there are a number. It\u2019s still a very fragmented market, and there are a number of small to mid-sized companies in which we are able to speak with who really recognize the value of Marsh & McLennan. I mean we can demonstrate the companies, the amount of additional mega producers that are developed post-acquisition by Marsh & McLennan than existed pre-acquisition. So, joining Marsh & McLennan is good for the production force of these companies. And that is a \u2013 that\u2019s our unique selling proposition. The capabilities and resources of the organization broadly enable producers to be more successful than they otherwise would be. But John, do you want to talk about rating environment? And what\u2019s been moving around the most? Yes, I think it\u2019s pretty high level, and then we can move on to Peter on that.\nJohn Doyle: Sure Dan. Jimmy, I covered it before. What I would say is that in most geographies and in most major product lines, there was a slight moderation in the average price increase in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. It was pretty consistent, I would say, is probably the most notable thing when you look at it on a line-by-line basis and country-by-country basis. So prices on average, again went from 22% to 18%. As we have shared in the past, this is \u2013 our index skews to large accounts. The middle market pricing is more modest than that. I think the most notable quarter-to-quarter change was in cyber, where the average price increase actually doubled from the fourth quarter into the first quarter from high-teens to mid-30s. And so \u2013 and as you might expect, given the exposure environment there, our cyber sales are growing quite rapidly at the moment.\nDan Glaser: Thanks. Peter, do you have anything to add?\nPeter Hearn: No. I would reflect much of what John says, Jimmy, in that reinsurance pricing has been reasonably consistent by line of business over the past several quarters. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 the capacity is adequate, demand is high. As John said, lines of business, like cyber, have been more capacity constrained, but there is still capacity available at a price. And I think at the end of the day, the reinsurer approach to our client base has been reasonable, and it\u2019s been based on experience and exposure of the individual client. And so prices, I wouldn\u2019t say, have gone down. I would say prices have moderated, but that\u2019s based on capacity. But it\u2019s a function of exposure and experience by client. It is not a broad based across the board rate increased for everybody regardless of how you performed.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. I have a question just on some of the disruption that the Aon-Willis deal could be having in the marketplace as you look at teams and hiring? Maybe you could just talk about how that\u2019s progressing? And Dan, I think you talked about adding 500 people in headcount last quarter in terms of strategic hires. I was just wondering maybe to give an update on that this quarter? And how you see that progressing throughout the year?\nDan Glaser: Yes. I mean, we expect to be a real employer of choice in the business. And \u2013 but we are a big company, we have got 76,000 people. So, whether we lose a team of 20 people or hire 10, or 20, or 30 individuals, ultimately, it\u2019s not a huge needle mover for us, but it\u2019s a way for us to build our strength, build on the mountain of talent that we already have. The 500 net headcount increase in the fourth quarter didn\u2019t all come from Aon and Willis, although the majority did. And I think in the first quarter, we are up over 100 heads net from Aon and Willis. And I would expect that kind of thing to continue. This is a competitive environment and I do believe working at Marsh & McLennan is a choice, not just for companies going through consolidation, but for experts broadly within our industry.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for that Dan. And then I guess just another question. Just taking a look at other operating expenses, those were down quite a bit year-over-year. I think it was down 10.5% year-over-year versus basically flat last quarter, both against pre-COVID comps. I guess I am wondering, were there any timing or sort of delayed expenses this quarter outside of T&E or any sort of other sort of COVID-related expense reductions during the quarter?\nDan Glaser: Yes. No, the comparison is a bit different. Things like meetings, for example, like you take the first quarter, what do you do when the year starts, you get together and you talk about growth. So, that happened in 2020. It didn\u2019t happen in 2021. But \u2013 so meeting some advertising, some use of facilities, that sort of thing. But we are not really overly concerned about the expense comparisons. We were always working to move our other operating expenses down. To me, the glory would be a nice, solid, chunky comp and ben ratio and a much lower other operating expense ratio. That\u2019s the kind of thing over time that we want to do. And we have all kinds of initiatives in the firm to try to reduce other operating expenses as a way to deliver better margin, but also to deliver better comp and ben ratios as well. And as you will note, comp and ben ratios were up in the quarter. And so that to me is a pretty good thing. Other operating expenses down, comp and ben flat or up. That\u2019s a pretty good result, with delivering big margin expansion for shareholders as well. Next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is open.\nMeyer Shields: With a question for Peter, you have described, I think consistently high reinsurance demand and solid capacity. Does the Florida \u2013 the upcoming Florida reinsurance renewals, does that look any different than what we have seen so far in 1.1 and 4.1?\nDan Glaser: Peter, right over to you.\nPeter Hearn: Yes. Thank you, Dan. Meyer, if we look through the rest of the year and obviously, June, what is the next big renewal date, I think we have to separate Florida from the rest of the \u2013 of our portfolio because it\u2019s a different animal in a lot of different ways, not only from a regulatory environment, not only from a capital environment, not only from a capacity environment, not only from a legal environment. So, as we look out into the rest of the year, we anticipate that for the broad percentage of our portfolio that pricing will remain consistent. Again, as I just said, it isn\u2019t based on individual client exposure and experience. Florida, obviously, has gone through quite a turbulent time not only from a loss standpoint, but an underlying erosion of capital due to heightened litigation. What that\u2019s resulted in is demand is actually going to be less because people are re-underwriting their books of business to deal with some of the spikes and exposure that they have. But overall, I would say there is more than enough capacity in Florida. And for the non-frequency layers and more capacity layers, there will be plenty of capacity. And for the lower down, higher risk layers, pricing will go up. We are still unsure as to what the dimensions are. We are expecting mid to high-single digits for loss experience, high loss experience. And it\u2019s still wait-and-see. But a lot of the capital in Florida comes from third-party capital, unlike the rest of our portfolio say for our retrocessional business.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That\u2019s tremendously helpful. Thank you. And then I was hoping to slide in a question for John. When you look at the small account component of your domestic P&C business, can you talk about how that \u2013 whether pricing or underwriting asset has changed over the last 3 months to 6 months?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Meyer. Really, in most market cycles, middle market, the small commercial pricing just doesn\u2019t move with the same level of volatility that we see in the upper middle market and in large multinational accounts. And that this market cycle, really the last couple of years, it\u2019s been quite consistent with that observation. We saw, most of last year, small commercial. And there is a bit of not every insurer looks at the market kind of the same way, but small to the lower end of the middle market, we saw low-single digit price increases most of last year. It accelerated a bit in the fourth quarter to mid-single digit increases, and that\u2019s what we observed in the first quarter as well. What I would note in that segment where we do see more commission than we do in other parts of our business. Work comp, though is a huge part of our business there. And as I noted earlier, work comp pricing remains pretty favorable for our clients.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan, for any closing remarks.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. Thanks, everybody. I thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues for your perseverance under trying circumstances. These are the moments when our clients need us most. Thank you all very much, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dan Glaser",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, John Doyle of Marsh; Peter Hearn of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Scott McDonald of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh & McLennan had an outstanding start to 2021. Our first quarter results were excellent, and we are well positioned for a very good year. Even though the pandemic is ongoing, our underlying revenue growth of 6% is the highest in over 6 years and accelerated sequentially across every business. We also grew adjusted EPS by 21% and generated significant margin expansion. Our business has proven resilient throughout the pandemic. And with the global economy now beginning to turn the corner, we saw an acceleration in our growth. With 6% underlying growth to begin the year, we now expect full year 2021 underlying revenue growth to be at the high end of our 3% to 5% guidance range and possibly above. As we look ahead, the outlook for the U.S. and many of the countries we operate in is encouraging. However, many parts of the world continue to suffer with high levels of infection, and there is still a significant amount of uncertainty. GDP in the U.S. was close to flat in the first quarter and strong levels of growth are expected, starting in the second quarter, due to a rebound in demand as the impact of vaccines takes hold, along with favorable economic comparisons to a year ago. Meanwhile, in India, Brazil and many other parts of the world, case counts continue to rise and broad levels of vaccination remain a long way off. Our proprietary pandemic navigator now forecasts that the U.S. will achieve the herd immunity threshold by early to mid-summer, and we see a fairly similar time line in the UK. These milestones bring hope for reopening and economic growth, although it will vary by country. We are also mindful that the risk exists and that there still are many unknowns, such as variance of the virus, the efficacy of vaccines on the variants, the duration of immunity and vaccine hesitancy. But we are resilient and are confident we will be able to adapt to a wide range of scenarios, just as we have since the beginning of this crisis. Thanks Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A. Sure. So, why don't I take that to begin with, and then I will hand off to each of our business leaders, so they can talk a little bit about their growth prospects and how they looked at the quarter and what they are looking at going forward. I would just start by saying we have got real momentum right now. I mean the U.S. economy is getting stronger. The JLT integration is well behind us, and the combined organization is emerging from the pandemic strong, focused and on our front foot. New business generation was terrific across the business and in particular, at Marsh and Oliver Wyman. So when Scott and John speak, they can talk to you a little bit about their new business. But overall, retention was strong, growth was broad based. On the RIS side, pricing is a tailwind, and we are benefiting from some disruption in flight to quality. That said, Mike, there is nothing one-off or unusual about our results. So, we are not really going to get into, in coming quarters, do we expect a deceleration. Obviously, as Mark was saying, we start to get some easier comps on the top line and some tougher comps on the expense line, but it will play itself out, and we expect to have a very strong year. But why don't we start with Marsh, and John to just talk about growth a little bit. John? Thanks, John. Let me go to Peter for a couple of minutes. Peter, Guy Carpenter has grown considerably and consistently over a number of years now. But Peter, what are you thinking about growth right now? Thanks Peter. Mike, you mentioned Mercer. So Martine, you want to talk about growth at Mercer? Okay. Thanks Martine. So, we have often said how Oliver Wyman is a bit more sensitive to business confidence, economic outlook, etcetera. And their strong growth actually bodes very well for the company overall. But Scott, do you want to talk a little bit about Oliver Wyman and how you see at least the quarter and the next couple of quarters? Thanks Scott. So Mike, I know that was a lot, but I figured there would be a lot of questions on growth we might as well go around the horn and hear from our business leaders. So anything else, Mike? Sure. And let's just be clear. We are on the client side of the table. So, these are \u2013 even at an 18% deceleration from 22% in the quarter sequentially, these are trying times for our clients and Marsh brokers are working really hard to put together the best package, the best solutions in the circumstances. John, you want to talk a little bit about commission versus fee and the impact of the rating environment on your overall growth just, in general terms? Thanks John. Next question please? Sure. So at least many companies, including Marsh & McLennan reduced expenses significantly, particularly in the second quarter and third quarter. And as you know, last year, we started coming back. It had positive expense growth in the fourth quarter because we did some hiring and that sort of thing. The largest reductions were in T&E and our view is that will be a gradual comeback. We believe people will travel with more purpose and more for thought than pre-pandemic, and we are certainly going to encourage that within the company. We are going to try to get away from the \u2013 anytime anywhere, hop on an airplane culture and pause and say, okay, there are important times where you go visit a client or you go visit a market. That's absolutely to be sure. But we have proven that we can operate effectively remotely. And so we want to create that a little bit of pause and say, \u201cCan I do this?\u201d via a remote access like a Zoom or Teams, etcetera. And so it also is important for us in terms of as we manage our carbon footprint going forward, and it's important for other companies, I think to act in a similar fashion. So, now one thing that let's not lose sight of, even though there may be some pressure as some expenses start to come back, as we go through the year. That's actually good news. That means that the world is recovering, the economy is recovering that means business is getting back to normal, that has growth implications for us. And longer term, we have learned a lot during this pandemic period, and we believe we can be a leaner, more agile organization. And that has implications. That means that while the office is core to our culture, and is a central part of how we operate, we know we can operate with more flexibility and more agility than we have done in the past. And longer term, that has implications for our real estate expense, which are quite heavy. And so I would expect that we will be able to get some savings there over time. Do you have another question, Elyse? Sure. So a couple of things, and then I will hand over to Mark. I mean overall, just to bear in mind that PayneWest is April 1. So that was not a first quarter item. It's beginning of the second quarter. But we wanted to call it out because it's an important acquisition for the company. We have been at it for 150 years, and we have been acquiring firms for that entire period of time. Let's not forget Henry Marsh and Donald McLennan came together and formed Marsh & McLennan. And so we don't pay much attention to what's happening to the tax rate, capital gains or what interest rates are because we are not looking for companies to combine with and to join us who really are just playing the economics. We cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. We almost always for our important acquisitions are in exclusive discussions with the other company. And we are coming together because we see value on both sides. We can grow better together. We can serve clients better together, etcetera. And so I don't believe that we don't have a budget around acquisitions. We go through our process and what happens, happens as we go through. But ultimately, let me hand to Mark and he can talk about capital management more broadly and what we have available for this year and our expectations of how we would likely use it. But Mark? Thanks Mark. Next question please. Yes. I mean, we had good international growth overall in the company, both in Marsh, but also on OW and Guy Carpenter as well. And Mercer had sequential growth. So overall, I mean I would also bear in mind that over the last couple of years, we have digested the biggest acquisition in our history, and that had some headwind with us as well in terms of revenue growth. And we have seen \u2013 and disruption. So, we have seen a nice comeback in places like Latin America and also in Asia Pac than what we have been experiencing for the last year or so. But the big winner, in terms of turnaround, was UK. John, you want to talk about your business in the UK a little bit? Anything else, Phil? I mean, I think the general idea of divestment would be to satisfy regulators' concerns about having enough competitors in the marketplace. So, it would be unusual for them to look to us as a possible answer. I mean we are open to all ideas, but ultimately, I think it's unlikely that we would be a participant in all a very small area in that kind of vein. Now having said that, there are plenty of very good, high quality firms that we are in discussions with. And so when we look at our M&A pipeline, we look over the course of years, not over the course of months, and we have got a very rich pipeline of companies that we are having discussions with. So, we feel very good about our ability to continue to add to the strength. And I would just use that as a backdrop to growth in general. Like we generally feel that underlying growth is the most important measure to evaluate the health of the overall organization. So, our focus is generally on underlying growth. But every once in a while, you have to look at GAAP, what's the company doing on an overall basis. And if I just look at RIS, as an example, first quarter last year, we grew a very big organization on a GAAP basis, 20%, and followed up in this first quarter by an 11% on top of the 20% on a GAAP basis. We are significantly growing the organization. And on the consulting side, it was more like a 5% on GAAP last year, followed by a 6% this year on GAAP. So we are having good underlying performance, but we are also having a much larger organization and growing a much larger organization. Next question, please, operator. Okay. So I will talk about your M&A point, and then I will hand off to John and Peter Hearn, so they can talk a little bit about the rate environment and a little bit more debt, although that's really inside baseball. Ultimately, when we look at deals, as I mentioned before, we are not chasing any deals. Your conclusion that multiples have gone up over the last number of years is absolutely true. Multiples are higher, which means we should be more selective. And it means that we should understand the pro forma calculations in a deep way, because most of these organizations are private. So, the pro forma results are far different than the actual results over the previous years and there can be a disconnect in terms of what expectations are versus the reality of a performing business. Now, our goal is actually to buy high quality firms. That's our primary goal. Firms that match our culture, where there is good chemistry, where the leaders plan to stay in the business and keep growing the business. And there are a number. It's still a very fragmented market, and there are a number of small to mid-sized companies in which we are able to speak with who really recognize the value of Marsh & McLennan. I mean we can demonstrate the companies, the amount of additional mega producers that are developed post-acquisition by Marsh & McLennan than existed pre-acquisition. So, joining Marsh & McLennan is good for the production force of these companies. And that is a \u2013 that's our unique selling proposition. The capabilities and resources of the organization broadly enable producers to be more successful than they otherwise would be. But John, do you want to talk about rating environment? And what's been moving around the most? Yes, I think it's pretty high level, and then we can move on to Peter on that. Thanks. Peter, do you have anything to add? Thank you. Next question please. Yes. I mean, we expect to be a real employer of choice in the business. And \u2013 but we are a big company, we have got 76,000 people. So, whether we lose a team of 20 people or hire 10, or 20, or 30 individuals, ultimately, it's not a huge needle mover for us, but it's a way for us to build our strength, build on the mountain of talent that we already have. The 500 net headcount increase in the fourth quarter didn't all come from Aon and Willis, although the majority did. And I think in the first quarter, we are up over 100 heads net from Aon and Willis. And I would expect that kind of thing to continue. This is a competitive environment and I do believe working at Marsh & McLennan is a choice, not just for companies going through consolidation, but for experts broadly within our industry. Yes. No, the comparison is a bit different. Things like meetings, for example, like you take the first quarter, what do you do when the year starts, you get together and you talk about growth. So, that happened in 2020. It didn't happen in 2021. But \u2013 so meeting some advertising, some use of facilities, that sort of thing. But we are not really overly concerned about the expense comparisons. We were always working to move our other operating expenses down. To me, the glory would be a nice, solid, chunky comp and ben ratio and a much lower other operating expense ratio. That's the kind of thing over time that we want to do. And we have all kinds of initiatives in the firm to try to reduce other operating expenses as a way to deliver better margin, but also to deliver better comp and ben ratios as well. And as you will note, comp and ben ratios were up in the quarter. And so that to me is a pretty good thing. Other operating expenses down, comp and ben flat or up. That's a pretty good result, with delivering big margin expansion for shareholders as well. Next question please. Peter, right over to you. Thank you. Thanks, everybody. I thank everybody for joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 76,000 colleagues for your perseverance under trying circumstances. These are the moments when our clients need us most. Thank you all very much, and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter."

            "content": "Thanks Dan. Mike, as Dan noted, nothing particularly one-off in nature about the growth in the quarter. I was very pleased with the start to the year. Mark gave a bit of an around the world view in his prepared remarks. But just a little bit more color. Specialty growth was particularly strong in the quarter, in FINPRO, in our private equity practice, construction and energy, also very, very strong results in the quarter. We had good growth in benefits. Our MGA and affinity operations also had a good quarter. So, I was quite pleased with it. I think we executed well for sure. Dan talked about our new business. The renewal line was strong as well. We are very, very focused in what's still a very difficult market for our clients. But I think we are positioned well. And as Dan noted, the economy is picking up in some important markets for us. There is still obviously some uncertainty as Dan and Mark both noted in the macros, but I am very, very pleased with the start to the year. Sure. Mike, about 60% of our revenue is commission based, but about 50% of Marsh's total revenue is exposed P&C pricing, right. So we have commission in the benefit side as well in some markets. So as Dan noted, it's still a very, very difficult market for our clients. And obviously, an uneven economy for so many of our clients. And so our clients, of course, are adapting to that. Some in this market and certainly throughout 2020, we are choosing to retain some more risks, whether it's through higher retentions or lower limits. Our captive management business is experiencing pretty strong growth as well as an indicator of maybe how our clients are reacting to the market. But it's still a difficult market. The D&O market, the excess casualty market in the U.S. and the cyber markets remain the most challenging. On the other hand, the work comp pricing continues to be pretty favorable for our clients and was modestly down. Pricing was modestly down in that product area here in the United States. So, the underwriting community is clearly concerned about elevated cat activity was obviously a busy cat quarter in the United States in the first quarter. The word lost cost inflation, lower interest rates, but my expectations is that we will continue to see some moderation of price increases throughout the rest of the year. Again, I expect prices to be up year-over-year, but I do expect them to be up somewhat less than they get up in recent quarters. Sure, Dan. Phil, as you noted, there, of course, will be ups and downs on a global basis in any kind of normal economy. And obviously, we are still recovering and still in the pandemic, as Dan noted in his prepared remarks earlier. But I was very, very pleased with our performance in the quarter in the UK. It's been a bit of a stress point for us over the last 18 months or so. Some of it related to just indigestion from coming together with JLT and some headwinds there. But we saw good growth, a lot of it from our middle marketing UK business, but also in the specialty areas, as I noted before, particularly strong growth in our financial lines business. The D&O market, as I said earlier, is difficult for our clients, very, very meaningful cyber growth in the UK and construction and energy were off to a terrific start. Elsewhere in the world, I think just another bright spot to point out, we saw very, very good new business growth in Australia. So, I was quite pleased with that. So yes, it was an improved performance by the international team, and we expect continued good momentum. Sure Dan. Jimmy, I covered it before. What I would say is that in most geographies and in most major product lines, there was a slight moderation in the average price increase in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. It was pretty consistent, I would say, is probably the most notable thing when you look at it on a line-by-line basis and country-by-country basis. So prices on average, again went from 22% to 18%. As we have shared in the past, this is \u2013 our index skews to large accounts. The middle market pricing is more modest than that. I think the most notable quarter-to-quarter change was in cyber, where the average price increase actually doubled from the fourth quarter into the first quarter from high-teens to mid-30s. And so \u2013 and as you might expect, given the exposure environment there, our cyber sales are growing quite rapidly at the moment. Sure, Meyer. Really, in most market cycles, middle market, the small commercial pricing just doesn't move with the same level of volatility that we see in the upper middle market and in large multinational accounts. And that this market cycle, really the last couple of years, it's been quite consistent with that observation. We saw, most of last year, small commercial. And there is a bit of not every insurer looks at the market kind of the same way, but small to the lower end of the middle market, we saw low-single digit price increases most of last year. It accelerated a bit in the fourth quarter to mid-single digit increases, and that's what we observed in the first quarter as well. What I would note in that segment where we do see more commission than we do in other parts of our business. Work comp, though is a huge part of our business there. And as I noted earlier, work comp pricing remains pretty favorable for our clients."

            "name": "Peter Hearn",
            "content": "Thanks Dan. Mike, our model is consistent growth over a long period of time. I think we have demonstrated that, as Dan said. We do benefit from the rate increases that are going on in the market. But the bulk of our income is coming from new business wins, and it's well balanced across all of our businesses from North America, Latin America, Middle East, Asia Pac, global specialties, all have recognized strong growth in the first quarter, and we see the same holding true for Q2. Now Q3s tend to be very small quarters for us. So, there is more volatility inherent in them. But over the past few years, we have shown once again that even with smaller quarters, based on the disciplined approach we had to new business and the approach of growing in any market condition, we have demonstrated our ability to grow. No. I would reflect much of what John says, Jimmy, in that reinsurance pricing has been reasonably consistent by line of business over the past several quarters. And I think it's \u2013 the capacity is adequate, demand is high. As John said, lines of business, like cyber, have been more capacity constrained, but there is still capacity available at a price. And I think at the end of the day, the reinsurer approach to our client base has been reasonable, and it's been based on experience and exposure of the individual client. And so prices, I wouldn't say, have gone down. I would say prices have moderated, but that's based on capacity. But it's a function of exposure and experience by client. It is not a broad based across the board rate increased for everybody regardless of how you performed. Yes. Thank you, Dan. Meyer, if we look through the rest of the year and obviously, June, what is the next big renewal date, I think we have to separate Florida from the rest of the \u2013 of our portfolio because it's a different animal in a lot of different ways, not only from a regulatory environment, not only from a capital environment, not only from a capacity environment, not only from a legal environment. So, as we look out into the rest of the year, we anticipate that for the broad percentage of our portfolio that pricing will remain consistent. Again, as I just said, it isn't based on individual client exposure and experience. Florida, obviously, has gone through quite a turbulent time not only from a loss standpoint, but an underlying erosion of capital due to heightened litigation. What that's resulted in is demand is actually going to be less because people are re-underwriting their books of business to deal with some of the spikes and exposure that they have. But overall, I would say there is more than enough capacity in Florida. And for the non-frequency layers and more capacity layers, there will be plenty of capacity. And for the lower down, higher risk layers, pricing will go up. We are still unsure as to what the dimensions are. We are expecting mid to high-single digits for loss experience, high loss experience. And it's still wait-and-see. But a lot of the capital in Florida comes from third-party capital, unlike the rest of our portfolio say for our retrocessional business."

            "content": "Thank you, Dan, and good morning. Our first quarter results were outstanding, and we are well positioned for a very good 2021 despite the continued uncertainty associated with the pandemic. Underlying growth accelerated across all of our businesses, and our margin expansion and earnings growth were impressive. Consolidated revenue increased 9% in the first quarter to $5.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 6%. Operating income and adjusted operating income were both approximately $1.4 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 260 basis points to 29.6%, GAAP EPS was $1.91, and adjusted EPS was $1.99, up 21% compared with the first quarter a year ago. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services. First quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, up 11% compared with the year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This marks the highest level of underlying growth since 2012. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $1.1 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 36.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.3 billion, up 13% compared with a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. This was Marsh's highest level of underlying growth in nearly 2 decades. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and driven by double-digit new business growth and solid retention and was impressive considering Marsh's strong growth in the first quarter of last year. The U.S. and Canada division delivered another exceptional quarter, with underlying revenue growth of 9%. This is the highest quarterly underlying growth U.S. and Canada has achieved since we began reporting their results, and they have now averaged 6% underlying growth over the last 12 quarters. In international, underlying growth was strong at 6%, marking the highest underlying growth since 2013. EMEA was up 6%, with strong results in each region, including in the UK. Asia Pacific was up 8%, a strong rebound from the fourth quarter and comes on top of 6% growth in the first quarter of 2020. And Latin America grew 6% on an underlying basis, continuing to show sequential improvement. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $895 million, up 8% or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in North America, EMEA, Global Specialties and Latin America Treaty. Guy Carpenter has now achieved 5% or higher underlying growth in 12 of the last 14 quarters. In the Consulting segment, revenue in the quarter was $1.9 billion, up 6% from a year ago or 3% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income was $370 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded by 330 basis points to 20.5%. Thanks Dan. So Elyse, let me just run you through. So we still expect, as you said, roughly $3.5 billion of capital deployed this year, and I will just run you through the math of how that breaks down. We have already spent the $0.5 billion that we had targeted on deleveraging. So as I mentioned earlier, we pulled forward our July debt repayment. Dividends will run around $1 billion, and that leaves $2 billion of that $3.5 billion available for M&A and share repurchase. Dan mentioned that we closed our PayneWest, which was a chunky deal. And our M&A pipeline remains full. It's always hard to predict how much we will actually do. But our hope is that we see a meaningful amount of M&A this year. But we also expect that we will see a meaningful amount of share repurchase, at least enough to see our share count go down this year."

We have seen increased demand in our services, sequential revenue growth months-to-months during the quarter and a return to growth actually in March. We know that during the pandemic, clients have postponed discretionary work due to uncertainty and also employment levels have dropped. But now we expect tailwinds from economic and job growth partially offset, of course, by the continued structural decline in the client benefit. But clearly, we see a return to growth for the rest of the year, starting with Q2. In terms of demands, our investment business, investment management business, in particular, with lots of demand in the alternative space, and ESG and being seemed investment opportunities is strong. We started the year with strong inflow. Demand for digital solutions around the whole of business is also strong. Health has been resilient through the pandemic, and we see lots of demand in our Darwin health platform and global benefit management. And we have seen quite a good uptick in Korea as well with demand for engagement surveys, transformation of the workplace, return to a new normal redefinition of the way to work. So overall, it looks like a strong rest of the year for Mercer."

For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nJohn Doyle: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, the President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. I am excited to be leading this call today for the first time as President and CEO. Marsh McLennan is an outstanding company with unique capabilities in the critical areas of risk, strategy and people. We help clients address their greatest challenges and find new possibilities as they navigate dynamic environments. We have exceptional talent, a wide range of solutions and a track record of execution in financial performance. Our leadership team is focused on delivering the full capabilities of Marsh McLennan to our clients, continuously improving the client and colleague experience, efficiently managing capital and driving growth and value for shareholders. Over the past year, I've been meeting with colleagues and clients to exchange ideas about how we can accelerate impact for clients and enable their success. These conversations reinforce my conviction that we are in the right businesses with strong brands and deep client relationships. I am confident that we have meaningful opportunity at the intersections of our businesses, where together our scale, data, insights and solutions are highly valued by clients. The strength of our unique value proposition has us well positioned for the years ahead. Today, we are focused, aligned, and succeeding together as our results demonstrate. 2022 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. We generated 9% underlying revenue growth, continuing our best period of growth in more than two decades with each of our businesses delivering strong results. Our total revenue surpassed $20 billion and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $4.8 billion. This was on top of 18% growth in 2021. We reported adjusted margin expansion for the 15th consecutive year. Adjusted EPS growth was 11%. I am particularly pleased with this performance as our results included costs related to our strategic investments in talent and the continued normalization of T&E. These results also came on top of 24% growth in 2021, and we delivered significant capital return to shareholders raising our dividend by 10% and completing $1.9 billion of share repurchases the largest annual amount in our history.\nAvascent: We overcame significant foreign exchange and capital market headwinds to generate these results through execution, growth and exceptional client engagement. I'm particularly proud of these achievements amid a year of seamless leadership transitions at Marsh and Guy Carpenter. Our purpose and strategy underpin our performance. Marsh McLennan makes a difference in the moments that matter for our clients, colleagues, and our communities. Turning purpose into practice our strategy focuses on several core elements, promoting a culture that attracts and retains top talent in our business, investing to strengthen our capabilities organically and inorganically, positioning ourselves in segments and geographies with attractive fundamentals, leveraging data and insights to help clients become more resilient and find new opportunities, and delivering Marsh McLennan's full value proposition to enable client success. We complement our colleague and client facing strategy with our approach to expense and capital management. We focus on growing revenue faster than expenses, which contributes to annual margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth, and we manage capital allocation to balance performance in the near-term with investing for the long term. We are accelerating collaboration across our business to drive greater growth and efficiency. We are implementing new ways to operate, reduce complexity and organize for impact. In this regard, we took actions in the fourth quarter to align our workforce and skillsets with evolving needs, rationalized technology, and reduced our real estate footprint. Together, these actions resulted in an approximately $230 million of charges. Based on our outlook today, we expect they will drive $125 million to $150 million of savings in 2023. Overall, they reflect an opportunity to accelerate impact for clients, reinvest in our capabilities, and to be more efficient and connected.\nP&C:\nceded: Now, let me turn to our fourth quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.47 which is up 8% versus a year ago or 12%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 7%. Underlying revenue grew 8% in RIS and 6% in consulting. Marsh grew 6%. Guy Carpenter grew 5%. Mercer grew 5%, and Oliver Wyman grew 8%. Overall the fourth quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 13%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 160 basis points year-over-year. As we look ahead to 2023, we see a mixed economic picture. While there is a risk of recession for major economies, we also believe there are many factors that remain supportive of growth for our business. Softer real GDP growth is offset by elevated inflation, which drives higher insured values and loss costs. P&C insurance rates continue to increase as insurers account for rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, the risks of social inflation and higher reinsurance costs. Healthcare costs continue to rise due to higher wages and labor shortages in the healthcare sector. The U.S. labor market continues to remain among the tightest employment environments of the past half century with 3.5% unemployment and over $10 million unfilled jobs and short-term interest rates are at the highest level since the financial crisis increasing our fiduciary income. When the world is volatile and uncertain, demand for our services typically rises. This year's global risks report, which we just published in collaboration with the World Economic Forum highlights that risks confronting our clients extend well beyond economic and insurance cycle concerns. The report identified the cost of living crisis, failure to mitigate and adapt to climate change, extreme weather, natural resource crises, the erosion of social cohesion, cybercrime and geo-economic confrontation among the top risks facing society over the near-term and next decade. In these areas and many others, we are working with clients to meet these challenges, build resilience and capture new opportunities. Our colleagues are inspired by the opportunity to work on these critical issues and to make a difference in the moments that matter. Looking forward, we are well positioned for 2023 and beyond. We expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth in 2023, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist, but meaningful uncertainty exists and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. However, we have a track record of resilience across economic cycles. In summary, 2022 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan, one in which all of our businesses delivered strong performance. We generated record revenues and earnings, saw the benefit of recent investments in growth, continued to execute on our acquisition strategy and made record share repurchases. We are proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value they deliver to our clients and shareholders. We closed the year on a high note and look forward to another year of strong performance in 2023. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. We are pleased with our strong fourth quarter results, which capped another terrific year. We delivered strength on strength from a financial performance perspective and continued to invest organically and inorganically. These investments combined with the actions we took in the fourth quarter, position us well for another good year in 2023. Consolidated revenue decreased 2% in the fourth quarter to $5 billion. As a reminder, the fourth quarter last year included a large gain related to Marsh India. Foreign exchange was also a meaningful headwind to GAAP revenue growth. However, on an underlying basis, revenue increased 7%. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $680 million and adjusted operating income increased 13% to $1 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22%. GAAP EPS was $0.93 and adjusted EPS was $1.47. Our full year, 2022 results were outstanding. Operating income for the year was $4.3 billion and adjusted operating income was $4.8 billion, an increase of 11% over 2021. Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $6.85 and our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points marking our 15th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. 2022 was also a strong year for capital management. We deployed $3.9 billion of capital, enhanced our short-term liquidity, raised our dividend 10% and saw Moody's lift our rating outlook to positive. Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue decreased 3% to $2.9 billion. Note that RIS in specifically Marsh is where the India gain affected our revenue comparisons. On an underlying basis, revenue in RIS increased 8%, the strong result reflecting the momentum in our business and our resilience in the face of macro headwinds and on economic uncertainty. RIS operating income was $472 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 23% to $685 million. The adjusted margin expanded 290 basis points to 25.6%. For the year, revenue in RIS was $12.6 billion and increase of 5% with underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income growth for the year was impressive at 15%, our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 130 basis points to 29.8%. At Marsh revenue in the quarter decreased 6% to $2.7 billion, but was up 6% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of a tough comparison to the fourth quarter of last year, which saw strong M&A and SPAC related activity. For the full year revenue at Marsh was $10.5 billion, an increase of 3% or 8% on an underlying basis. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 5% for the quarter, a solid result given the headwind from lower M&A and capital markets activity. We expect this headwind to persist into the first quarter, but normalize as we enter the second quarter. For the full year underlying growth in U.S. and Canada was excellent at 7%. In international, underlying growth was 8% in the quarter with Asian Pacific up 12%, EMEA up 7%, and Latin America up 4%. For the full year underlying growth in international was strong at 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $171 million, up 5% on an underlying basis. For the year revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 8% or 9% on an underlying basis. Based on our current outlook, we expect Guy Carpenter's growth in 2023 to benefit from a tightening reinsurance market. In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue was $2.1 billion flat versus the prior year. Revenue grew 6% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $336 million, and adjusted operating income was $407 million, down 1% reflecting continued foreign exchange and capital markets headwinds. The adjusted operating margin was 20% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points. For the full year Consulting revenue was $8.1 billion, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 4% to $1.5 billion, while our adjusted operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 19.7%. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis. This is a good result considering the impact of capital markets on our investments business. Wealth was flat on an underlying basis due to year-over-year declines in both equity and fixed income markets. Solid growth in defined benefits helped mitigate the drop in investments. Our assets under management were $345 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 9% sequentially, but down 17% from the fourth quarter of last year due to market declines in foreign exchange, which more than offset strong positive net flows. Health revenue grew 8% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter, reflecting strength in employer and government segments and momentum across all regions. Career revenue increased 12% on an underlying basis, reflecting continued demand in rewards, talent strategy, and workforce transformation. For the year revenue at Mercer was $5.3 billion, an increase of 6% on an underlying basis, the highest result since 2008. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was $765 million, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis, a solid result considering a tough comparison to 22% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $2.8 billion, an increase of 13% on an underlying basis, building on the 21% growth in 2021. As we look to 2023, we expect growth at Oliver Wyman to slow given rising economic uncertainty. Adjusted corporate expense was $68 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange was a $0.05 headwind in the fourth quarter, and for the full year was a $0.12 headwind. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.03 headwind in 2023 with $0.05 in the first quarter and $0.02 in the second quarter, reversing to a modest tailwind in the second half. I want to spend a minute on the $344 million of noteworthy items in the quarter, the majority of which related to actions we initiated last year, as well as the final exit of JLT's headquarters in London. The largest category of noteworthy items in the quarter was $233 million relating to restructuring activities which are focused on workforce actions, rationalizing technology, and reducing our overall real estate footprint. The charges included severance associated with headcount reductions, as well as provisions related to real estate actions. Although we expect some reinvestment of the savings from these actions, the majority will flow to earnings. Based on our outlook today, we expect the benefit to earnings in 2023 could be $125 million to $150 million. We anticipate further actions under this program, which will continue through 2023 and possibly into 2024. We are still refining estimates of future opportunities, but at this point, we don't see additional charges in 2023 or 2024 exceeding the amounts taken in 2022. As we typically do on our fourth quarter calls, will give a brief update on our global retirement plans. Our other net benefit credit was $57 million in the quarter and $235 million for the full year. For 2023, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be about $235 million. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $169 million in 2022. We expect cash contributions will be roughly $107 million in 2023. Investment income was a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and a loss of $5 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects losses in our private equity portfolio. Given current market conditions, we anticipate negligible investment income in the first quarter of 2023. This compares to $17 [ph] million of investment income in the first quarter of 2022 on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $127 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense for the full year of 2023 of approximately $565 million. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on commercial paper, which we use for efficient working capital management. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 22.9%. This compares with 20.6% in the fourth quarter last year. Both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. For the full year 2022 our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5% compared with 23.6% in 2021. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 25% to 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management in our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $11.5 billion. This includes the $1 billion of senior notes we issued in October. We used a portion of the proceeds from this offering to redeem $350 million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March, 2023. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in October, 2023 when $250 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion and included $298 million for dividends, $395 million for acquisitions, and $350 million for share repurchases. For the year uses of cash totaled $3.9 billion and included $1.1 billion for dividends, $806 million for acquisitions, and $1.9 billion for sherry purchases. As a reminder, we have a balanced capital management strategy that supports our consistent focus on delivering solid performance in the near-term while investing for sustained growth over the long-term. We prioritize reinvestment in the business, both for organic investments and acquisitions. We favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases and believe they are the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long-term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time, and each year we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count. Looking ahead to 2023, based on our outlook today, we expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital across dividends, acquisitions, and share purchases. The ultimate level of share purchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As John noted, there is significant uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy. However, we feel good about our momentum and position, and despite the uncertainty, there are factors that remain supportive of growth in our business. Based on our outlook today for 2023, we expect mid-single digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good morning. I had a question first just on the restructuring actions and sort of wanted to just take a step back and just ask, is this a, are you instituting a downturn playbook just based on something you are seeing in the revenue environment that it hasn't shown up in results yet, but is that something that you're seeing and this is a defensive move or should I think of this as more of an offensive move, just from picking up some low hanging fruit that you see just sort of offer improving your efficiency throughout the organization?\nJohn Doyle: Good morning, David. There's nothing defensive about the move, right? We took steps to align our workforce and skill sets with the evolving needs of our clients. You know, as I noted, when I outlined some of the highlights of the global risk report, those client challenges and opportunities are constantly evolving in dynamic and we've also identified some opportunities to create some greater efficiencies across our businesses. We're working more closely together. We've rationalized some technology, reduced our real estate footprint. So it's not an indication of what we think the economic outlook is.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it, thanks. And then maybe just if you could just talk about some of the three drivers that you spoke of, I guess it was real estate, technology and workforce. Any way to size which, how much of that benefit is coming from each of those buckets and how we should think about some of the future actions that you might be taking?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, it's a mix. It's fairly balanced between the three different areas. And you know, as Mark noted, we're still doing some work and we see some further opportunities. However, I think it's likely that further charges would be less than what we took in the fourth quarter here. But again we're challenging ourselves looking at where we've got talent, how it comes together, matching that against evolving needs in the marketplace and then pushing ourselves to operate in a different way and a more efficient way.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thank you.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, David. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.\nJamminder Bhullar: Hey, good morning, Jimmy. Hey, so John, you mentioned a little bit in your comments on just the hard market in reinsurance and also the firm market in commercial lines. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing, if you're seeing any changes in client behavior, whether more sort of self-insurance or higher retention rates at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, thanks Jimmy for the question. You know, as I noted in my comments, it was a very challenging January 1st property cat renewal. We expected it to be a challenging renewal season prior to Ian, and then Ian of course exacerbated it. You know, I did mention that some of the higher costs are offset a bit by higher retentions. My comments there were primarily about reinsurance and not insurance. But I'll ask Dean and Martin to comment a bit in a second, but what I would say I commented on the higher cat losses over the last several years. Reinsurers of course now have a higher cost to capital, inflation mark to market losses on the asset side of their balance sheet, just FX as well, a number of the big reinsurers and a lot other cat programs in the United States created some FX challenges as well. So, just a number of different factors led to a really reevaluation of pricing and capacity deployment from some of the bigger capital providers. But Dean, maybe you'll, you can go first and give an overview.\nDean Klisura: Yes, sure. Thanks John. I think in terms of client buying patterns, at January 1 in reinsurance, I mean, you mentioned increased retentions, attachment points. I mean, that was reinsured driven, right? Attachment points were up substantially for many of our clients, not only in the United States, but in all geographies with January 1 cat renewals. So our clients were forced to take more risk, more volatility on their balance sheets. In terms of buying patterns, that inflation driven demand for additional limit, everybody talked about all fall didn't really materialize. Clients mostly bought the same amount of cat limit they bought last year. Maybe up incrementally, maybe our global clients bought a little bit more, but in terms of limit, some of that limit that was eliminated at the bottom end of cat programs was put on top of programs, right? So clients made that up. But in terms of buying more, I think for many clients it was cost-prohibitive given the rate increases that John outlined around property cat, very challenging terms and conditions. You know, really reinsurers had the upper hand in this marketplace around pricing, attachment point and very challenging terms and conditions.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Dean. Martin, do you want to share some observations about the insurance market?\nMartin South:\nD&O:\nD&O: In terms of behavior, our clients are constantly looking at the optimization of their programs. Our captive management business grew nearly double digits in the quarter and for the year as clients retained some more of their risk and we have a wide range of value propositions to help our clients for the risks which they retain and they manage. And so we feel bullish that the changing market is not going to dampen our growth.\nJohn Doyle: So Jimmy, it remains a dynamic and challenging market for our clients. Higher cat losses, risks of core inflation, social inflation. So we continue to observe underwriting discipline broadly speaking across the market. Do you have a follow up?\nJamminder Bhullar: Yes, just for Mark on fiduciary investment income, it's obviously gone up a lot and even sequentially up to over 50% from 3Q and 4Q. Do you expect -- should we expect a further increase in that over time? Because what we've seen recently is in some of the regions rates are actually flattish over the past several months. So is there more of sort of a lag effect of what's happened with rates in fiduciary investment income or has the portfolio mostly reset higher?\nMark McGivney: Thanks Jimmy. Good morning. We certainly see continued upside in fiduciary income as we look to this year. Rates really didn't start to move till the back half of the year as you know. And even though it seems like a little bit of slowdown in a lot of places, the expectation is rates have not peaked. And also remember even for the fourth quarter, that's an average rate over the course of the quarter and rates moved even in the quarter. So it is something that we expect to continue to give us benefit into this year.\nJamminder Bhullar: Thank you.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks Jimmy. Andrew, can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question I guess combines the expense program in some of your fiduciary investment income comments. So the expense program seems like it could be around 70 basis point tailwind to your margins in 2023. And then I would assume you would get incremental uplift from fiduciary investment income rising per Mark's prior comments. So should we think of those two components is, a pretty good tailwind to your margin when we think about 2023 margin improvement?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, we're, I'm not going to give margin guidance, on the call, Elyse, and thanks for your question. Again, I think we're well positioned. We're in terrific businesses, just outstanding talent. And while there's some macro uncertainty, of course, that's out there, we expect strong revenue growth this year and we expect to increase our margins over the course of the year. Mark and I both shared a bit, what we expect to flow to the bottom line from the program this year. But we expect to maintain that discipline, that financial discipline that we've had for many years and to expand margin and to have strong adjusted EPS growth this year.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question on, you guys talked about some pretty robust reinsurance rate increases at January 1. Have you guys seen any changes on your commission structure just given the strong pricing? Are you making any changes to help your clients in the face of that pricing? And then Mark did say that you guys, that Guy Carpenter would see pretty strong growth over the coming year. I mean, we've never heard, we haven't been in an environment, right, with 40% plus price increases. How does that triangulate into organic growth within Guy Carpenter?\nJohn Doyle: We have been in that environment before. We've been around a long time, but it's been close to 20 years since we've operated in that kind of environment. We expect a good year of revenue growth at Guy Carpenter. As I noted in my prepared remarks ceded premiums won't track that rate increase, right? As our insurance company clients retained more risk or have their cap programs attached at a higher level. We work with our clients, of course, to manage our compensation. We're very transparent about that. In some cases, they're cat commission agreements that we have with our, with our clients, but again, we expect it to be a good year for Guy Carpenter.\nElyse Greenspan: And any change in the commission structure?\nJohn Doyle: As I said, we work through that with our clients. We have agreements with them and a very transparent dialogue about how we're remunerated. Thank you.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nJohn Doyle: Andrew, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. I was wondering if you could give a sense maybe of how much more of a tail end could be left from inflation or exposures that you can see as we sit here today?\nJohn Doyle: Thanks Mike for the question. As I noted in my prepared remarks, while we're not immune to the macro economy, of course, there are some real factors that support growth of Marsh & McLennan. In the risk side of our business inflation is one of those areas. So, whether it's wage inflation, core inflation, higher and of course inflation leads to higher losses and more discipline in the pricing environment. All of those issues are supportive of growth. It's a client by client outcome though, right? Some of our clients, there are winners and losers in any economy, of course and some of those distinctions might be more stark in an economy like we're in today. And so some are operating from a position of strength and others of course, will need to be more defensive. So we work through that with them, client by client, but broadly speaking, inflation and nominal GDP, is more indicative of demand for our revenue and our services than real GDP.\nMichael Ward: Awesome, thank you.\nJohn Doyle: Do you have a followup, Mike?\nMichael Ward: Yes. Actually may be on Oliver Wyman and Mercer career, I know you mentioned a possible slowdown in Wyman, but can you talk about the pipeline and whether you're seeing that slow down or just kind of anticipating businesses reducing their consulting appetite?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Mike. So let me start by just saying that Oliver Wyman is just a really important part of our value proposition for our clients and a critical part of our company. They advise the C-suite on the critical issues of the day and really help us differentiate our value proposition. We had an outstanding year of growth in 2022 on top of 21% growth in 2021 and over the midterm, medium term, we expect higher growth out of Oliver Wyman than our other businesses. So having said that, we do expect some moderation of growth. So Nick, maybe I'll ask you to share an outlook with Mike.\nNick Studer: Yes, thanks John and thank you, Mike. As John just started to do, let me put Oliver Wyman into context. We're very happy with a second consecutive year of double digit growth. I think it's 15 years since we've achieved that. We've added over a third to this in that time, and we're confident that we gained market share in what is a pretty fragmented market. And that growth was very well balanced. We grew across all our regions, across all of our capability practices and across most of our industries in 2022. But having said that, this is my seventh call, and it's the first one that I've reported on something below double digit growth in the quarter. That 8% does reflect two things. We're certainly lapping a high growth quarter, but at the same time, we did see a slowing in the pipeline as our major clients, and we pause and digest after several pretty turbulent years. We remain optimistic in the longer-term revenue plans. Yes, there was a pretty heavy surge in the last two years, but we'll likely revert and closer to our medium term expectations of mid-to-high single digit underlying growth through the cycle.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Nick. Mike, maybe I'll ask Martine as well to comment on Career, Mercer and I would point out Mercer had its best year of growth since 2008, so we feel absolutely terrific about it. Excellent growth in health, excellent growth in career, but Martine maybe you could share a little bit more color?\nMartine Ferland: Yes, no, thanks John and Mike as well for the question. Yes, of course and you're right to say that our Career business is the one that has most discretionary projects. So of course we are looking at all indicators in a cautionary way. But what I want to say here is, we've had a tremendous two years in Career. Q4 was a 12% growth. The whole of 2022 was 14% growth. The demand here is really related to change in the world of work. We've added to that in 2022 wage in high inflation. We have the labor shortages issue. So we're looking at reward strategies, workforce analytics, future of work skills, gap, talent engagement, assessment of skills. It's all on top of our client's agenda. So overall at this point, we've entered 2023 with very solid growth momentum, strong sales, strong pipeline. And of course, we are confident in this year, we are monitoring development on sales pipeline and client sentiment given the macroeconomic conditions that are foreseen. But the question remains that as the people agenda stays such an elevated point for our clients that what we're seeing right now is that demand stays strong.\nJohn Doyle: Terrific. Thank you, Martine. Thanks Mike. Andrew, can we have our next question please?\nOperator: Certainly. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I think previously, maybe not for a while, but you guys had talked about a 3% to 5% organic growth outlook longer-term. Just curious if your view on that has changed at all?\nJohn Doyle: Well, you know, as I shared we expect mid-single-digits underlying revenue growth or better for this year, that's the guidance we're sharing. As I noted Robert in my prepared remarks, we're in terrific businesses, we're well positioned in those businesses, just have outstanding talent and a culture that makes us an employer of choice as well. So we feel good about our growth prospects for the near-term.\nRobert Cox: Got it. And maybe just a follow up, yes, how big of a deal are wage pressures in the business today and into 2023, I think the consulting segment perhaps is a little bit more susceptible to that and we saw margins decline year-over-year, so just wondering how big of an impact that is?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, you know, it's been manageable for us for sure. As we said we worked really, really hard on our culture and becoming an employer of choice in the markets that we operate in. I think we attract outstanding talent because of that culture, because of the strength of the brands, and it really enables talented individuals who want to devote their career in the areas of risk strategy and people to be their best when they work here. And that's how we think about it. And as I said earlier it's a privilege to do the work that we do, trying to tackle the issues of the day. We're a collaborative environment, so you do it with some really talented people who are very, very focused on client impact. And our client engagement, our colleague engagement, excuse me, remains very, very high. So we saw some elevated voluntary turnover in the early part of the year, but that moderated in the second half of the year, that I think that elevated turnover was really a bounce back from very abnormally low voluntary turnover. But wage pressure has been manageable for us. We're being thoughtful about merit pools and how we allocate those pools, but we feel very, very well positioned from a talent perspective. Thank you, Robert. Andrew, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. A couple of quick questions. First, John, strategically, when you can anticipate higher fiduciary income, does that translate into more latitude for longer-term investments?\nJohn Doyle: You know, we're trying to balance, obviously, the near-term and the mid-term. The growth in fiduciary income may or may not be correlated to client demand or opportunities that we see. It's obviously connected to other macro factors. But you know, I think part of the steps that we took in the fourth quarter, the actions that we took in the fourth quarter create capacity for us to make investments and to become a stronger business going forward.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that's helpful. Second question, when we've heard a lot of comments very clearly accurate about the difficult reinsurance renewal season, does that actually impact the expenses that Guy Carpenter incurs? I mean, obviously a stressful period, but I'm wondering about the financial impact.\nJohn Doyle: It was a stressful period. Our colleagues were attested and I would say I don't want to mitigate the impact on our insurance company clients. It was a challenging outcome. Again, we expected a difficult market as well. But no, it doesn't impact our cost base in any meaningful way. And, as I said, the overall outlook is supportive of a good growth environment for Guy Carpenter. Okay, thank you Meyer. Andrew, next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with Credit Suisse.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. First question is around underlying revenue growth. Marsh is up 6%, Guy Carpenter up 5%. Given the strong exposure growth, the strong rate increases, if you netted that out, would the underlying growth be negative?\nJohn Doyle: No. it would not be, it would not be negative Andrew, but, and thank you for your question. It was a very strong year of growth at both Marsh and at Guy Carpenter. I would note Guy Carpenter is a very, very small quarter. And so again, we're quite pleased with the revenue growth. And as I've said a number of times this morning, Guy Carpenter is very well positioned for good strong growth in 2023. At Marsh, it was an outstanding year. You know, 8% for the year, 6% in the quarter. You know, as we noted, I mean, I'll ask Martin to comment on this in a second. Marsh in the U.S. had some headwinds related to the capital markets, right? So, and Martin mentioned earlier the impact of pricing. We had fewer M&A with less M&A activity, less ITO activity. So as Martin pointed out that an impact on pricing there, but it was more of a volume issue. We expected that entering into the fourth quarter. It's also a headwind for us into the first quarter as well. But we expect a good growth year in 2023. Martin, maybe you could provide a little bit more color to share your thoughts on 2023 and our growth at the end of 2022.\nMartin South: Yes, of course, delighted to, thank you. Well, as you said, we had growth of 6% in the quarter. It was on top of the 9% in the prior course of 2021. Strong balance of growth across the portfolio. International in the quarter grew 8%, APAC at 12%, EMEA at 7%, Latin America at 4%. You mentioned U.S. and Canada at 5%. I'd say that the U.S. and Canada was actually impacted by headwinds in our business. So we had tough comps in the prior year from elevated M&A and SPAC activity and capital markets activity in the back half of 2021. We think but for that, we would have been posting underlying growth in the region of 8% for the U.S. and Canada, so very strong results there and we feel bullish that as that normalizes in the first quarter of next year, we're going to see an uptick. The full year growth international was 10%, APAC 13%, Latin America 12%, which is a much better representation of what they're likely to. This is the smallest part of international Latin America, so you should look at the full year as a better indicative rather than just a discreet quarter. EMEA was up 8% and the U.S. and Canada up 7%. And then when we look at what's driven the growth and what we think are likely to grow in the future construction growth was double-digit energy and power dealing with the transition up double percent of trade credit business up double digits. Our advisory business, which helps our clients mitigate changes in risk grew double digits throughout the year. So we feel very good about how we're positioned about the geographies that we're in about our position in the value proposition and feeling good about growth.\nJohn Doyle: So Andrew, we're working our way through some headwinds in the capital markets, but again feel terrific about the growth in 2022 and we believe we're well positioned in 2023 as well. Do you have a follow up?\nAndrew Kligerman: Yes, one quick follow up, just curious about the JLT integration cost of $91 million in the quarter, just given that it's been, I think the deal was 2019, so I was just curious what that was?\nJohn Doyle: It was 2019. Mark, maybe you can share with Andrew.\nMark McGivney: And Andrew that pretty much was the final step of integration with the JLT and it related to basically the provisions for shutting down abandoning their headquarters in London as we were able to finally consolidate all of our headcount into our location and into Tower Place. That is an action that was planned at the very early stages of the integration. It just took us that long to refit Tower Place to accommodate all the headcount.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it. Thanks so much.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you. Andrew, we're ready for our next question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: Good morning. First question, you had talked about the potential for maybe some compensation structure changes and then [indiscernible] environment. Given that that you've been in this market before, can you maybe give us some ideas or some reflections of how this played out in previous hard markets? How much compensation or commission rate changes in hard markets?\nJohn Doyle: You know Yaron our commission levels have been fairly constant for a number of years. As I said, with some of our larger clients at Guy Carpenter, we've had capped commission agreements that have been in place for many years. And so we work with those clients to be fairly remunerated for the work that we do over the course of the year. And so, we have good, healthy relationships with those clients and work our way through them. So I don't think there's really anything more to share than that.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And my other question is with regards to the restructuring, so the workforce action that you identified, does that implicate or impact any of the hires that you had back in 2021?\nJohn Doyle: No. we feel terrific about the strategic talent that we brought into the organization over the course of the last couple of years. We invested in talent last year as well. The returns on those investments have been absolutely terrific and driving a meaningful amount of our growth in 2022 and we expect it to drive growth for us in 2023 as well. So as I said, the actions that we took were more about aligning our workforce and skillsets with evolving needs. And it also is connected in some part with how we challenged ourselves to operate more efficiently, more simply and bringing our businesses closer together.\nYaron Kinar: Thanks and nice year ahead.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks Yaron. I appreciate it. Andrew, next question please?\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Yes and thanks. Two of them for you. First one Mark, I'm just curious, the $4 billion of kind of planned capital deployment this year, how does that necessarily, how does that relate to kind of what your expectations are on free cash flow? Because I think you actually had $4 billion of capital when you expected to deploy last year?\nMark McGivney: Sure. so Brian, we do plan to deploy about $4 billion of capital. The largest source of that capital deployment will be free cash flow that we expect to generate. We also entered, if you saw our balance sheet, we entered the year with a little bit of cash from the debt raise we did late last year. So, that will provide some additional capital as well.\nBrian Meredith: But I guess my point is, you don't expect free cash will be flat year-over-year, do you?\nMark McGivney: Well, free cash flow for us has been a great story as you know, over a long period of time and over time tends to track pretty well with our strong earnings growth. And our outlook is for solid earnings growth. But cash flow can be volatile. So we generally stay away from predicting free cash flow with precision. But as I said, the biggest source of capital underpinning our projected deployment is going to be the free cash flow we generate.\nBrian Meredith: Great, that's helpful. And then John, I'm just curious a lot of big corporations out there are tightening belts right now in preparation for what they see as a challenging 2023. And I appreciate you're looking for still a pretty good strong 2023. Maybe you can just remind us what's the lag effect that you see with your revenues vis-\u00e0-vis kind of a slowdown in business activity out there? I always remember there's like some lag effect.\nJohn Doyle: Well, it's hard to talk about lag with any precision. And my comments earlier about the broader environment really carry the day. I mean, yes, it's an uncertain environment. It's maybe modestly more positive when you think about the reopening of China and how Europe has at least so far successfully managed energy related risks and the impact on the economy in Europe. Having said that, there's still meaningful geopolitical risks out there. But for us, again, nominal GDP is more indicative than real GDP and demand remains strong for us in our businesses. So, as I said, we expect a bit of a moderation of demand at Oliver Wyman, but broadly speaking, our businesses overall including strong growth prospects for Guy Carpenter remain quite healthy. And if things get more difficult, we know how to perform in a more challenging environment. We have the playbook and we're ready to execute on that playbook. We're a resilient business and so we'll navigate whatever comes in front of us.\nBrian Meredith: Great, thanks for the answer.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks Brian. Andrew?\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, good morning. First question, just looking at the margins in this quarter, fiduciary investment income was a pretty big contributor, it looked like, to the margin expansion, and the comp ratio actually looked relatively flat with 4Q 2021. I guess that just surprised me a bit, given there was so much hiring a year ago with not much revenue attached to it. So yes, how should we be thinking about, I guess the operating leverage or the lack thereof that on that cooperation in the fourth quarter?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks Ryan for the question. As I said last year start 15th consecutive year of margin expansion, and we expect 2023 to be our 16th consecutive year. I was pleased with the margin improvement, particularly in light of the investments that we've made in talent. So, it's a modest improvement, slight improvement in the comp and then ratio. But again, margin is an outcome for us. We're focused on growing earnings growing the free cash of the business and we're going to invest where we think it makes sense, where we think it can make us stronger as a business and accelerate client impact. But at the same time, what's not going to change here is our focus on continuous improvement and our commitment to excellent financial performance.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then I guess just a follow up, John, obviously early days in the new seat, but just curious what you've been focusing on or where you're spending your time?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. My voice has been in our strategy for nearly seven years now. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're in the right businesses. We've got market leading brands. We're well positioned, just outstanding talent. It's a real privilege to get to work with the folks that I get to work with every day. And as I said, our focus on continuous improvement and our commitment to excellent financial performance are not going to change here. Having said that, I see some real opportunities at the intersections of our businesses. Client needs are dynamic as we talked about, and those needs don't fit neatly into the boxes on our org chart. We're a big company. We need to be organized in certain ways, but those needs don't necessarily fit again against not all of them anyway, don't fit neatly into how we're organized. And so we're going to be more deliberate about how we collaborate. We've got a unique collection of capabilities. We're going to go to market together where we think it makes sense and where it makes sense is where we can accelerate client impact and enable our client success. And our colleagues are passionate about client success and the work that they do on behalf of clients. So they're excited about the possibilities. I'm excited about the possibilities. We're also going to work more closely together to drive some efficiencies across our business. So I see a lot of opportunity. Again, I think we're in terrific businesses and a terrific team here and I'm excited about the days ahead. Thank you, Ryan. Andrew that was the last question, we'll wrap it up now.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan for any closing remarks.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Andrew. And thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication in a challenging year. And I also want to thank our clients for their continued confidence in Marsh McLennan. Thank you all very much and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dean Klisura",
            "content": "Yes, sure. Thanks John. I think in terms of client buying patterns, at January 1 in reinsurance, I mean, you mentioned increased retentions, attachment points. I mean, that was reinsured driven, right? Attachment points were up substantially for many of our clients, not only in the United States, but in all geographies with January 1 cat renewals. So our clients were forced to take more risk, more volatility on their balance sheets. In terms of buying patterns, that inflation driven demand for additional limit, everybody talked about all fall didn't really materialize. Clients mostly bought the same amount of cat limit they bought last year. Maybe up incrementally, maybe our global clients bought a little bit more, but in terms of limit, some of that limit that was eliminated at the bottom end of cat programs was put on top of programs, right? So clients made that up. But in terms of buying more, I think for many clients it was cost-prohibitive given the rate increases that John outlined around property cat, very challenging terms and conditions. You know, really reinsurers had the upper hand in this marketplace around pricing, attachment point and very challenging terms and conditions."

            "content": "Yes, thanks John and thank you, Mike. As John just started to do, let me put Oliver Wyman into context. We're very happy with a second consecutive year of double digit growth. I think it's 15 years since we've achieved that. We've added over a third to this in that time, and we're confident that we gained market share in what is a pretty fragmented market. And that growth was very well balanced. We grew across all our regions, across all of our capability practices and across most of our industries in 2022. But having said that, this is my seventh call, and it's the first one that I've reported on something below double digit growth in the quarter. That 8% does reflect two things. We're certainly lapping a high growth quarter, but at the same time, we did see a slowing in the pipeline as our major clients, and we pause and digest after several pretty turbulent years. We remain optimistic in the longer-term revenue plans. Yes, there was a pretty heavy surge in the last two years, but we'll likely revert and closer to our medium term expectations of mid-to-high single digit underlying growth through the cycle."

            "name": "John Doyle",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, the President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. I am excited to be leading this call today for the first time as President and CEO. Marsh McLennan is an outstanding company with unique capabilities in the critical areas of risk, strategy and people. We help clients address their greatest challenges and find new possibilities as they navigate dynamic environments. We have exceptional talent, a wide range of solutions and a track record of execution in financial performance. Our leadership team is focused on delivering the full capabilities of Marsh McLennan to our clients, continuously improving the client and colleague experience, efficiently managing capital and driving growth and value for shareholders. Over the past year, I've been meeting with colleagues and clients to exchange ideas about how we can accelerate impact for clients and enable their success. These conversations reinforce my conviction that we are in the right businesses with strong brands and deep client relationships. I am confident that we have meaningful opportunity at the intersections of our businesses, where together our scale, data, insights and solutions are highly valued by clients. The strength of our unique value proposition has us well positioned for the years ahead. Today, we are focused, aligned, and succeeding together as our results demonstrate. 2022 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. We generated 9% underlying revenue growth, continuing our best period of growth in more than two decades with each of our businesses delivering strong results. Our total revenue surpassed $20 billion and adjusted operating income grew 11% to $4.8 billion. This was on top of 18% growth in 2021. We reported adjusted margin expansion for the 15th consecutive year. Adjusted EPS growth was 11%. I am particularly pleased with this performance as our results included costs related to our strategic investments in talent and the continued normalization of T&E. These results also came on top of 24% growth in 2021, and we delivered significant capital return to shareholders raising our dividend by 10% and completing $1.9 billion of share repurchases the largest annual amount in our history. Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A. Good morning, David. There's nothing defensive about the move, right? We took steps to align our workforce and skill sets with the evolving needs of our clients. You know, as I noted, when I outlined some of the highlights of the global risk report, those client challenges and opportunities are constantly evolving in dynamic and we've also identified some opportunities to create some greater efficiencies across our businesses. We're working more closely together. We've rationalized some technology, reduced our real estate footprint. So it's not an indication of what we think the economic outlook is. Yes, it's a mix. It's fairly balanced between the three different areas. And you know, as Mark noted, we're still doing some work and we see some further opportunities. However, I think it's likely that further charges would be less than what we took in the fourth quarter here. But again we're challenging ourselves looking at where we've got talent, how it comes together, matching that against evolving needs in the marketplace and then pushing ourselves to operate in a different way and a more efficient way. Thanks, David. Operator, next question? Sure, thanks Jimmy for the question. You know, as I noted in my comments, it was a very challenging January 1st property cat renewal. We expected it to be a challenging renewal season prior to Ian, and then Ian of course exacerbated it. You know, I did mention that some of the higher costs are offset a bit by higher retentions. My comments there were primarily about reinsurance and not insurance. But I'll ask Dean and Martin to comment a bit in a second, but what I would say I commented on the higher cat losses over the last several years. Reinsurers of course now have a higher cost to capital, inflation mark to market losses on the asset side of their balance sheet, just FX as well, a number of the big reinsurers and a lot other cat programs in the United States created some FX challenges as well. So, just a number of different factors led to a really reevaluation of pricing and capacity deployment from some of the bigger capital providers. But Dean, maybe you'll, you can go first and give an overview. Thanks, Dean. Martin, do you want to share some observations about the insurance market? So Jimmy, it remains a dynamic and challenging market for our clients. Higher cat losses, risks of core inflation, social inflation. So we continue to observe underwriting discipline broadly speaking across the market. Do you have a follow up? Thanks Jimmy. Andrew, can we have the next question please? Yes, we're, I'm not going to give margin guidance, on the call, Elyse, and thanks for your question. Again, I think we're well positioned. We're in terrific businesses, just outstanding talent. And while there's some macro uncertainty, of course, that's out there, we expect strong revenue growth this year and we expect to increase our margins over the course of the year. Mark and I both shared a bit, what we expect to flow to the bottom line from the program this year. But we expect to maintain that discipline, that financial discipline that we've had for many years and to expand margin and to have strong adjusted EPS growth this year. We have been in that environment before. We've been around a long time, but it's been close to 20 years since we've operated in that kind of environment. We expect a good year of revenue growth at Guy Carpenter. As I noted in my prepared remarks ceded premiums won't track that rate increase, right? As our insurance company clients retained more risk or have their cap programs attached at a higher level. We work with our clients, of course, to manage our compensation. We're very transparent about that. In some cases, they're cat commission agreements that we have with our, with our clients, but again, we expect it to be a good year for Guy Carpenter. As I said, we work through that with our clients. We have agreements with them and a very transparent dialogue about how we're remunerated. Thank you. Andrew, next question please? Thanks Mike for the question. As I noted in my prepared remarks, while we're not immune to the macro economy, of course, there are some real factors that support growth of Marsh & McLennan. In the risk side of our business inflation is one of those areas. So, whether it's wage inflation, core inflation, higher and of course inflation leads to higher losses and more discipline in the pricing environment. All of those issues are supportive of growth. It's a client by client outcome though, right? Some of our clients, there are winners and losers in any economy, of course and some of those distinctions might be more stark in an economy like we're in today. And so some are operating from a position of strength and others of course, will need to be more defensive. So we work through that with them, client by client, but broadly speaking, inflation and nominal GDP, is more indicative of demand for our revenue and our services than real GDP. Do you have a followup, Mike? Sure, Mike. So let me start by just saying that Oliver Wyman is just a really important part of our value proposition for our clients and a critical part of our company. They advise the C-suite on the critical issues of the day and really help us differentiate our value proposition. We had an outstanding year of growth in 2022 on top of 21% growth in 2021 and over the midterm, medium term, we expect higher growth out of Oliver Wyman than our other businesses. So having said that, we do expect some moderation of growth. So Nick, maybe I'll ask you to share an outlook with Mike. Thanks, Nick. Mike, maybe I'll ask Martine as well to comment on Career, Mercer and I would point out Mercer had its best year of growth since 2008, so we feel absolutely terrific about it. Excellent growth in health, excellent growth in career, but Martine maybe you could share a little bit more color? Terrific. Thank you, Martine. Thanks Mike. Andrew, can we have our next question please? Well, you know, as I shared we expect mid-single-digits underlying revenue growth or better for this year, that's the guidance we're sharing. As I noted Robert in my prepared remarks, we're in terrific businesses, we're well positioned in those businesses, just have outstanding talent and a culture that makes us an employer of choice as well. So we feel good about our growth prospects for the near-term. Yes, you know, it's been manageable for us for sure. As we said we worked really, really hard on our culture and becoming an employer of choice in the markets that we operate in. I think we attract outstanding talent because of that culture, because of the strength of the brands, and it really enables talented individuals who want to devote their career in the areas of risk strategy and people to be their best when they work here. And that's how we think about it. And as I said earlier it's a privilege to do the work that we do, trying to tackle the issues of the day. We're a collaborative environment, so you do it with some really talented people who are very, very focused on client impact. And our client engagement, our colleague engagement, excuse me, remains very, very high. So we saw some elevated voluntary turnover in the early part of the year, but that moderated in the second half of the year, that I think that elevated turnover was really a bounce back from very abnormally low voluntary turnover. But wage pressure has been manageable for us. We're being thoughtful about merit pools and how we allocate those pools, but we feel very, very well positioned from a talent perspective. Thank you, Robert. Andrew, next question please? You know, we're trying to balance, obviously, the near-term and the mid-term. The growth in fiduciary income may or may not be correlated to client demand or opportunities that we see. It's obviously connected to other macro factors. But you know, I think part of the steps that we took in the fourth quarter, the actions that we took in the fourth quarter create capacity for us to make investments and to become a stronger business going forward. It was a stressful period. Our colleagues were attested and I would say I don't want to mitigate the impact on our insurance company clients. It was a challenging outcome. Again, we expected a difficult market as well. But no, it doesn't impact our cost base in any meaningful way. And, as I said, the overall outlook is supportive of a good growth environment for Guy Carpenter. Okay, thank you Meyer. Andrew, next question please? No. it would not be, it would not be negative Andrew, but, and thank you for your question. It was a very strong year of growth at both Marsh and at Guy Carpenter. I would note Guy Carpenter is a very, very small quarter. And so again, we're quite pleased with the revenue growth. And as I've said a number of times this morning, Guy Carpenter is very well positioned for good strong growth in 2023. At Marsh, it was an outstanding year. You know, 8% for the year, 6% in the quarter. You know, as we noted, I mean, I'll ask Martin to comment on this in a second. Marsh in the U.S. had some headwinds related to the capital markets, right? So, and Martin mentioned earlier the impact of pricing. We had fewer M&A with less M&A activity, less ITO activity. So as Martin pointed out that an impact on pricing there, but it was more of a volume issue. We expected that entering into the fourth quarter. It's also a headwind for us into the first quarter as well. But we expect a good growth year in 2023. Martin, maybe you could provide a little bit more color to share your thoughts on 2023 and our growth at the end of 2022. So Andrew, we're working our way through some headwinds in the capital markets, but again feel terrific about the growth in 2022 and we believe we're well positioned in 2023 as well. Do you have a follow up? It was 2019. Mark, maybe you can share with Andrew. Thank you. Andrew, we're ready for our next question. You know Yaron our commission levels have been fairly constant for a number of years. As I said, with some of our larger clients at Guy Carpenter, we've had capped commission agreements that have been in place for many years. And so we work with those clients to be fairly remunerated for the work that we do over the course of the year. And so, we have good, healthy relationships with those clients and work our way through them. So I don't think there's really anything more to share than that. No. we feel terrific about the strategic talent that we brought into the organization over the course of the last couple of years. We invested in talent last year as well. The returns on those investments have been absolutely terrific and driving a meaningful amount of our growth in 2022 and we expect it to drive growth for us in 2023 as well. So as I said, the actions that we took were more about aligning our workforce and skillsets with evolving needs. And it also is connected in some part with how we challenged ourselves to operate more efficiently, more simply and bringing our businesses closer together. Thanks Yaron. I appreciate it. Andrew, next question please? Well, it's hard to talk about lag with any precision. And my comments earlier about the broader environment really carry the day. I mean, yes, it's an uncertain environment. It's maybe modestly more positive when you think about the reopening of China and how Europe has at least so far successfully managed energy related risks and the impact on the economy in Europe. Having said that, there's still meaningful geopolitical risks out there. But for us, again, nominal GDP is more indicative than real GDP and demand remains strong for us in our businesses. So, as I said, we expect a bit of a moderation of demand at Oliver Wyman, but broadly speaking, our businesses overall including strong growth prospects for Guy Carpenter remain quite healthy. And if things get more difficult, we know how to perform in a more challenging environment. We have the playbook and we're ready to execute on that playbook. We're a resilient business and so we'll navigate whatever comes in front of us. Thanks Brian. Andrew? Yes, thanks Ryan for the question. As I said last year start 15th consecutive year of margin expansion, and we expect 2023 to be our 16th consecutive year. I was pleased with the margin improvement, particularly in light of the investments that we've made in talent. So, it's a modest improvement, slight improvement in the comp and then ratio. But again, margin is an outcome for us. We're focused on growing earnings growing the free cash of the business and we're going to invest where we think it makes sense, where we think it can make us stronger as a business and accelerate client impact. But at the same time, what's not going to change here is our focus on continuous improvement and our commitment to excellent financial performance. Sure. My voice has been in our strategy for nearly seven years now. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're in the right businesses. We've got market leading brands. We're well positioned, just outstanding talent. It's a real privilege to get to work with the folks that I get to work with every day. And as I said, our focus on continuous improvement and our commitment to excellent financial performance are not going to change here. Having said that, I see some real opportunities at the intersections of our businesses. Client needs are dynamic as we talked about, and those needs don't fit neatly into the boxes on our org chart. We're a big company. We need to be organized in certain ways, but those needs don't necessarily fit again against not all of them anyway, don't fit neatly into how we're organized. And so we're going to be more deliberate about how we collaborate. We've got a unique collection of capabilities. We're going to go to market together where we think it makes sense and where it makes sense is where we can accelerate client impact and enable our client success. And our colleagues are passionate about client success and the work that they do on behalf of clients. So they're excited about the possibilities. I'm excited about the possibilities. We're also going to work more closely together to drive some efficiencies across our business. So I see a lot of opportunity. Again, I think we're in terrific businesses and a terrific team here and I'm excited about the days ahead. Thank you, Ryan. Andrew that was the last question, we'll wrap it up now. Thanks, Andrew. And thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication in a challenging year. And I also want to thank our clients for their continued confidence in Marsh McLennan. Thank you all very much and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter."

            "content": "D&O: Yes, of course, delighted to, thank you. Well, as you said, we had growth of 6% in the quarter. It was on top of the 9% in the prior course of 2021. Strong balance of growth across the portfolio. International in the quarter grew 8%, APAC at 12%, EMEA at 7%, Latin America at 4%. You mentioned U.S. and Canada at 5%. I'd say that the U.S. and Canada was actually impacted by headwinds in our business. So we had tough comps in the prior year from elevated M&A and SPAC activity and capital markets activity in the back half of 2021. We think but for that, we would have been posting underlying growth in the region of 8% for the U.S. and Canada, so very strong results there and we feel bullish that as that normalizes in the first quarter of next year, we're going to see an uptick. The full year growth international was 10%, APAC 13%, Latin America 12%, which is a much better representation of what they're likely to. This is the smallest part of international Latin America, so you should look at the full year as a better indicative rather than just a discreet quarter. EMEA was up 8% and the U.S. and Canada up 7%. And then when we look at what's driven the growth and what we think are likely to grow in the future construction growth was double-digit energy and power dealing with the transition up double percent of trade credit business up double digits. Our advisory business, which helps our clients mitigate changes in risk grew double digits throughout the year. So we feel very good about how we're positioned about the geographies that we're in about our position in the value proposition and feeling good about growth."

            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning. We are pleased with our strong fourth quarter results, which capped another terrific year. We delivered strength on strength from a financial performance perspective and continued to invest organically and inorganically. These investments combined with the actions we took in the fourth quarter, position us well for another good year in 2023. Consolidated revenue decreased 2% in the fourth quarter to $5 billion. As a reminder, the fourth quarter last year included a large gain related to Marsh India. Foreign exchange was also a meaningful headwind to GAAP revenue growth. However, on an underlying basis, revenue increased 7%. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $680 million and adjusted operating income increased 13% to $1 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 160 basis points to 22%. GAAP EPS was $0.93 and adjusted EPS was $1.47. Our full year, 2022 results were outstanding. Operating income for the year was $4.3 billion and adjusted operating income was $4.8 billion, an increase of 11% over 2021. Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $6.85 and our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points marking our 15th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. 2022 was also a strong year for capital management. We deployed $3.9 billion of capital, enhanced our short-term liquidity, raised our dividend 10% and saw Moody's lift our rating outlook to positive. Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue decreased 3% to $2.9 billion. Note that RIS in specifically Marsh is where the India gain affected our revenue comparisons. On an underlying basis, revenue in RIS increased 8%, the strong result reflecting the momentum in our business and our resilience in the face of macro headwinds and on economic uncertainty. RIS operating income was $472 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 23% to $685 million. The adjusted margin expanded 290 basis points to 25.6%. For the year, revenue in RIS was $12.6 billion and increase of 5% with underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income growth for the year was impressive at 15%, our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 130 basis points to 29.8%. At Marsh revenue in the quarter decreased 6% to $2.7 billion, but was up 6% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of a tough comparison to the fourth quarter of last year, which saw strong M&A and SPAC related activity. For the full year revenue at Marsh was $10.5 billion, an increase of 3% or 8% on an underlying basis. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 5% for the quarter, a solid result given the headwind from lower M&A and capital markets activity. We expect this headwind to persist into the first quarter, but normalize as we enter the second quarter. For the full year underlying growth in U.S. and Canada was excellent at 7%. In international, underlying growth was 8% in the quarter with Asian Pacific up 12%, EMEA up 7%, and Latin America up 4%. For the full year underlying growth in international was strong at 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $171 million, up 5% on an underlying basis. For the year revenue was $2 billion, an increase of 8% or 9% on an underlying basis. Based on our current outlook, we expect Guy Carpenter's growth in 2023 to benefit from a tightening reinsurance market. In the Consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue was $2.1 billion flat versus the prior year. Revenue grew 6% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $336 million, and adjusted operating income was $407 million, down 1% reflecting continued foreign exchange and capital markets headwinds. The adjusted operating margin was 20% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points. For the full year Consulting revenue was $8.1 billion, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 4% to $1.5 billion, while our adjusted operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 19.7%. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis. This is a good result considering the impact of capital markets on our investments business. Wealth was flat on an underlying basis due to year-over-year declines in both equity and fixed income markets. Solid growth in defined benefits helped mitigate the drop in investments. Our assets under management were $345 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 9% sequentially, but down 17% from the fourth quarter of last year due to market declines in foreign exchange, which more than offset strong positive net flows. Health revenue grew 8% on an underlying basis in the fourth quarter, reflecting strength in employer and government segments and momentum across all regions. Career revenue increased 12% on an underlying basis, reflecting continued demand in rewards, talent strategy, and workforce transformation. For the year revenue at Mercer was $5.3 billion, an increase of 6% on an underlying basis, the highest result since 2008. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was $765 million, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis, a solid result considering a tough comparison to 22% growth in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $2.8 billion, an increase of 13% on an underlying basis, building on the 21% growth in 2021. As we look to 2023, we expect growth at Oliver Wyman to slow given rising economic uncertainty. Adjusted corporate expense was $68 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange was a $0.05 headwind in the fourth quarter, and for the full year was a $0.12 headwind. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.03 headwind in 2023 with $0.05 in the first quarter and $0.02 in the second quarter, reversing to a modest tailwind in the second half. I want to spend a minute on the $344 million of noteworthy items in the quarter, the majority of which related to actions we initiated last year, as well as the final exit of JLT's headquarters in London. The largest category of noteworthy items in the quarter was $233 million relating to restructuring activities which are focused on workforce actions, rationalizing technology, and reducing our overall real estate footprint. The charges included severance associated with headcount reductions, as well as provisions related to real estate actions. Although we expect some reinvestment of the savings from these actions, the majority will flow to earnings. Based on our outlook today, we expect the benefit to earnings in 2023 could be $125 million to $150 million. We anticipate further actions under this program, which will continue through 2023 and possibly into 2024. We are still refining estimates of future opportunities, but at this point, we don't see additional charges in 2023 or 2024 exceeding the amounts taken in 2022. As we typically do on our fourth quarter calls, will give a brief update on our global retirement plans. Our other net benefit credit was $57 million in the quarter and $235 million for the full year. For 2023, based on our current expectations, we anticipate our other net benefit credit will be about $235 million. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $169 million in 2022. We expect cash contributions will be roughly $107 million in 2023. Investment income was a loss of $6 million in the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis and a loss of $5 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects losses in our private equity portfolio. Given current market conditions, we anticipate negligible investment income in the first quarter of 2023. This compares to $17 [ph] million of investment income in the first quarter of 2022 on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $127 million. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense for the full year of 2023 of approximately $565 million. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on commercial paper, which we use for efficient working capital management. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 22.9%. This compares with 20.6% in the fourth quarter last year. Both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. For the full year 2022 our adjusted effective tax rate was 23.5% compared with 23.6% in 2021. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate for the full year was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of 25% to 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management in our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $11.5 billion. This includes the $1 billion of senior notes we issued in October. We used a portion of the proceeds from this offering to redeem $350 million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature in March, 2023. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in October, 2023 when $250 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion and included $298 million for dividends, $395 million for acquisitions, and $350 million for share repurchases. For the year uses of cash totaled $3.9 billion and included $1.1 billion for dividends, $806 million for acquisitions, and $1.9 billion for sherry purchases. As a reminder, we have a balanced capital management strategy that supports our consistent focus on delivering solid performance in the near-term while investing for sustained growth over the long-term. We prioritize reinvestment in the business, both for organic investments and acquisitions. We favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases and believe they are the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long-term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time, and each year we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count. Looking ahead to 2023, based on our outlook today, we expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital across dividends, acquisitions, and share purchases. The ultimate level of share purchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As John noted, there is significant uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy. However, we feel good about our momentum and position, and despite the uncertainty, there are factors that remain supportive of growth in our business. Based on our outlook today for 2023, we expect mid-single digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John. Thanks Jimmy. Good morning. We certainly see continued upside in fiduciary income as we look to this year. Rates really didn't start to move till the back half of the year as you know. And even though it seems like a little bit of slowdown in a lot of places, the expectation is rates have not peaked. And also remember even for the fourth quarter, that's an average rate over the course of the quarter and rates moved even in the quarter. So it is something that we expect to continue to give us benefit into this year. And Andrew that pretty much was the final step of integration with the JLT and it related to basically the provisions for shutting down abandoning their headquarters in London as we were able to finally consolidate all of our headcount into our location and into Tower Place. That is an action that was planned at the very early stages of the integration. It just took us that long to refit Tower Place to accommodate all the headcount. Sure. so Brian, we do plan to deploy about $4 billion of capital. The largest source of that capital deployment will be free cash flow that we expect to generate. We also entered, if you saw our balance sheet, we entered the year with a little bit of cash from the debt raise we did late last year. So, that will provide some additional capital as well. Well, free cash flow for us has been a great story as you know, over a long period of time and over time tends to track pretty well with our strong earnings growth. And our outlook is for solid earnings growth. But cash flow can be volatile. So we generally stay away from predicting free cash flow with precision. But as I said, the biggest source of capital underpinning our projected deployment is going to be the free cash flow we generate."

So of course we are looking at all indicators in a cautionary way. But what I want to say here is, we've had a tremendous two years in Career. Q4 was a 12% growth. The whole of 2022 was 14% growth. The demand here is really related to change in the world of work. We've added to that in 2022 wage in high inflation. We have the labor shortages issue. So we're looking at reward strategies, workforce analytics, future of work skills, gap, talent engagement, assessment of skills. It's all on top of our client's agenda. So overall at this point, we've entered 2023 with very solid growth momentum, strong sales, strong pipeline. And of course, we are confident in this year, we are monitoring development on sales pipeline and client sentiment given the macroeconomic conditions that are foreseen. But the question remains that as the people agenda stays such an elevated point for our clients that what we're seeing right now is that demand stays strong."

Fourth quarter 2022 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Today is my 60th earnings call at Marsh McLennan, and 40th as CEO. After 10 years as President and CEO, I will be retiring from Marsh McLennan at the end of the year. Leading this firm over the past decade has been the honor of a lifetime. Before I jump into our results, I'd like to say how pleased I am about the leadership succession we announced. The appointment of John Doyle as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1st continues to underscore Marsh McLennan's deep trove of industry-leading talent. During John's tenure as President and CEO of Marsh, he drove exceptional revenue and earnings growth. And as Group President and COO, John is finding new ways to harness the capabilities of Marsh McLennan across our business, accelerating impact for clients, colleagues and communities. John has been an indispensable partner to me and the other members of our Executive Committee in shaping and executing our strategy. He knows our business well and is focused on delivering outstanding performance for clients and shareholders. I am confident that our extraordinary success will continue under John's leadership. Marsh McLennan's third quarter results demonstrated strength on strength. Top line momentum continued across our business, extending the best run of quarterly underlying growth in over two decades. We generated strong top and bottom line results despite difficult year-over-year comparison. Underlying growth of 8% in the quarter reflects considerable strength across our organization. It represents the sixth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher top line growth, building on 13% growth a year ago. Adjusted operating income of $851 million was a third quarter record, and grew 12% on top of 19% in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS growth of 9% is excellent, especially given costs related to our strategic talent investments, the rebound of T&E, and 32% growth in the third quarter of 2021. We completed 500 million of share repurchases in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 1.6 billion, which is higher than any full year level of repurchases in our history. While the economic and geopolitical backdrop is uncertain, we have a proven track record of being resilient through cycles and are well positioned. Overall, our third quarter performance highlights the strength of Marsh McLennan, a critical nature of what we do for our clients and the unmatched expertise of our colleagues. With that let me turn it over to John. \nJohn Q. Doyle: Thanks Dan and good morning everyone. I am honored to become Marsh McLennan\u2019s next President and CEO, and grateful for the trust and confidence Dan and the Board have placed in me to lead this exceptional company. I'm eager to work with our colleagues in realizing new possibilities to serve our clients, create value for our shareholders, and support our communities.  I'm pleased with our third quarter results. We delivered strong growth despite a macro backdrop that is becoming more uncertain. We are delivering solutions to help clients navigate volatile economic, geopolitical, and risk landscape. As we discussed last quarter, there are aspects of the current environment that remains supportive of our growth. Higher inflation offsets lower real GDP growth, rising interest rates, boost our fiduciary income, and the challenging insurance market drives a flight to quality. We also have a track record of success and being resilient through cycles, and I believe Marsh McLennan is well positioned to perform. I would like to take a moment to discuss Hurricane Ian, that\u2019s had a devastating impact on the people and communities in Florida. Ian has the potential to be the costliest insured event in Florida's history and the second most damaging insured loss of all time. We are working with insurers to help our clients receive much-needed support. Insurance has a critical role to play in building homes and restoring shuttered businesses. Our work reinforces Marsh McLennan's purpose to be there in the moments that matter for our clients and communities.  Ian's Category 4 strength, incredible size, and slow pace resulted in tremendous damage. The cost of which is exacerbated by the effects of coastal development, the escalation of property values, general inflation, and persistent supply chain challenges. While the ultimate insured loss won't be known for some time, the impact on an already stressed property market will be significant. At mid-year reinsurance renewals, property market is already exhibiting strains. Following Ian, the property cat market is likely to tighten even further and perhaps see a significant supply-demand imbalance. We are harnessing our collective expertise, scale and capabilities to bring solutions to help our clients navigate this complex risk environment. Turning to our third quarter financial performance, we generated strong results. Adjusted EPS of $1.18 is up 9% versus a year ago, which is impressive on top of 32% growth in the third quarter of 2021. Total revenue increased 4% versus a year ago and rose 8% on an underlying basis, with 9% in RIS and 8% in Consulting. This is a terrific result, especially considering the prior year third quarter underlying growth of 13%. Marsh had an excellent quarter. Growth was 8%, reflecting new business and strong renewal growth. Guy Carpenter grew 7% [ph] in the quarter, continuing its string of terrific results. Mercer grew 5% in the quarter despite capital market headwinds, and Oliver Wyman grew 13%, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 12% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Overall, I am proud of our third quarter performance, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business. Given our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are on track for an outstanding year. We expect to generate high single-digit growth, underlying revenue, solid growth adjusted EPS and to report margin expansion for the 15th consecutive year. We are focused, aligned and succeeding together, as our results demonstrate. Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to say a few words about Dan. During Dan's tenure at the helm of Marsh McLennan, the company has been transformed. Our revenue has nearly doubled, our adjusted EPS has more than tripled, and our market cap has quadrupled. Our scale and capabilities have been enhanced, and our talent is unmatched. Dan led our expansion into new client segments and launched Marsh McLennan Agency, which has grown to $2.5 billion of annual revenue, closed 100 acquisitions at just over a decade. Dan also successfully led the company's $5.6 billion acquisition, JLT in 2019, the largest in our history. Most importantly, Dan has led our firm with vision, courage and integrity. Faced with the consequences of the pandemic, his values-first leadership ensured that the tough choices were made to safeguard our colleagues, to protect jobs and incomes, deliver for clients, bolster liquidity, and still produce significant growth. His decision were an inspiration to our colleagues and an example to the broader business community. Our financial performance speaks for itself, with Marsh McLennan's total shareholder return more than doubling the S&P 500 during Dan's stewardship as CEO. Less visible but even more significant is the sense of pride and the culture that Dan has instilled in the firm. Under his leadership, we are not only a great stock but a great company. We owe him our gratitude. So on behalf of our 86,000 colleagues, I thank Dan for his leadership. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2022.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John and good morning. As Dan and John mentioned, our performance in the third quarter reflects continued momentum across our business. We saw another quarter of strong underlying revenue growth, meaningful earnings growth despite tough revenue and expense comparisons. Consolidated revenue increased 4% to $4.8 billion and reflected underlying growth of 8%. Operating income was 791 million, adjusted operating income was 851 million. Our adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, up 110 [ph] basis points from last year. The increase was driven by modest operating leverage and a benefit from foreign exchange. We generated GAAP EPS of $1.08 in the quarter, adjusted EPS of $1.18 up 9% yearly [ph]. For the first nine months of 2022, underlying revenue growth was 9%, our adjusted operating income rose 11% to $3.7 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 25.6%, and our adjusted EPS increased 12% to $5.38. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $2.8 billion, up 6% compared with the year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 32% to 529 million. Adjusted operating income increased 20% to 562 million, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 22.4%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was 9.7 billion, underlying growth 10%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months increased 13% to $2.8 billion, with a margin of 31.1%, up 80 basis points from the same period in 2021. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, 5% from a year ago. Revenue growth of 8% on an underlying basis supported by strong retention and [Technical Difficulty]. U.S. and Canada had 5% underlying growth, a solid result considering a 16% growth in the third quarter of 2021 that included the benefit of significant M&A and SPAC-related activity. International underlying growth was 11%. Latin America grew 15%, Asia Pacific was up 14%, EMEA was up 9%. First nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was 7.8 billion, underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada was up 8%, International grew 10%. Guy Carpenter's third quarter revenue was 328 million [ph], up 7% on an underlying basis, reflecting solid production and retention. Guy Carpenter has now achieved underlying revenue growth of 7% or higher in six of the last seven quarters. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Partner generated 1.8 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth [ph]. In the Consulting segment, revenue of 2 billion was up 1% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis, building on 12% in the third quarter of 2021. Operating income decreased 14% to 350 million, reflecting a one-time noteworthy benefit a year ago. Adjusted operating income increased 3% to 362 million, where solid earnings growth was masked by a drag from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 19.1%. Consulting generated revenue of 6 billion for the first nine months of 2022, an underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 5% to 1.1 billion, the adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, flat versus the third quarter of 2021. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the third quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis, which is impressive given the impact of market declines on our investments. Career grew 15% on an underlying basis, a sixth consecutive quarter of mid to high-teens growth. We continue to see strong demand for solutions in workforce transformation as well as compensation and rewards. Health underlying growth was also excellent at 10% in the quarter, reflecting strength across all geographies. Wealth decreased 1% on an underlying basis due to declines in both equity and fixed income markets. This market impact represented a 2% headwind to Mercer's overall growth for the quarter. However, solid demand and defined benefits helped mitigate [indiscernible]. Our assets under management was $318 billion at the end of the third quarter, down 8% sequentially and 20% from the third quarter of last year, due entirely to market declines and foreign exchange. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $4 billion, up 6% from underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's strong momentum continued. Revenue in the third quarter was $667 million, an increase of 13% on an underlying growth. This comes on top of 25% of the third quarter last year and reflects continued strong demand across most geographies against solutions. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was 2 billion, increase of 15% on underlying growth. Adjusted corporate expense was 73 million in the third quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately 80 million for the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange had an immaterial effect on our adjusted EPS in the third quarter, although year-to-date, you can assess a headwind of 7% [ph]. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a headwind of $0.07 in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was 57 billion. For the full year 2022, we expect our other net benefit credit be around 230 million [ph]. We reported an investment loss of 1 million in the third quarter on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, we had investment income of $3 million [ph]. Interest expense in the third quarter was 118 million compared to 107 million in the third quarter of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense of 121 million in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 24.6% compared with 24.4% in the third quarter of last year, included a modest net benefit of discrete items [ph]. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, not project discrete items, which is positive or negative. Based on the current environment, reasonable to assume an adjusted effective tax rate of 25% for the full year 2022. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of 11.4 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity March of 2023 with 350 million of senior notes. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was 802 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled 931 million, included 293 million of dividends, 138 million for acquisitions, 500 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled 2.9 billion, included 840 million for dividends, 411 million for acquisitions, 1.6 billion of share repurchase. We continue to expect to deploy approximately 4 billion of cap in 2022 plus dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Overall, we remain on track for a terrific 2022. For the full year, we expect to generate high single-digit growth in underlying revenue, solid growth in adjusted EPS, and to report margin expansion for 15th consecutive year. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Thank you, Mark. Before we open up the call for Q&A, I just want to say it has been a great privilege to lead this firm and work side-by-side with smart, creative and dedicated people. I am immensely proud of our colleagues and what we have accomplished. Together, we've grown, innovated and persevered. We launched and built MMA, expanded our capabilities in combination with JLT, and demonstrated resilience in the face of a financial crisis and global pandemic. We emerged as a better and stronger firm by relying on each other, living our values, supporting our communities, and staying focused on clients. I have always believed the greatness of our companies is in how we deliver in the big moments and the small. Under John's leadership, I know Marsh McLennan will continue to thrive and prosper, to make a difference in the moments that matter. There is no one I trust more with the company we've built together, and with the important work ahead. I'd like to thank our clients for choosing to do business with us, our shareholders for their continued confidence, most importantly our colleagues. All that we have achieved is due to their efforts. With that, operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. First, Dan my congrats to you on your upcoming retirement. It's been great working with you through the years. My first question is on U.S. and Canada within RIS in the quarter. The growth did slow from where you guys have been trending. I know we've had some good and bad quarters as we've gone through the pandemic and came out. Was there anything specific going on in the third quarter that you want to point out within that business?\nDaniel S. Glaser: Thanks, Elyse and I appreciate your comments. So thank you very much, and I hope to keep in touch with you. So let me just start out. I'll hand off to Martin in a second. Obviously, Marsh has been doing fantastically well, and U.S., Canada has done well as well. So I would just start by saying that the comparable was pretty tough at 16% growth in U.S., Canada last year. But Martin, do you want to dig in and give a little bit more color?\nMartin South: Thank you, Dan. Yes. Just to start, we are very pleased with the strong organic growth of 8% in the quarter, which is on top of 13% in the prior quarter 2021. Our growth is strong across all the geographies. EMEA was up 9%, Asia Pac, 14%, LAC was up 15% -- 5%, as you noted in the U.S. Overall, good year-to-date growth of 9%. And whilst the 5% is a slowdown, it was 16% in Q3 of 2021. When we look at the U.S. over a longer period, the U.S. and Canada is 8% year-to-date and 13% in the full year of 2021. Canada is doing extremely well, and the U.S. growth last year in the back half of the year, there was exceptional performance in M&A, SPAC, and capital markets activity, and we don't see that repeating in the volatility of the markets going forward. We made fantastic investments last year in producers that are focused on recurring business, so we feel we're very well positioned in the U.S. going forward.\nDaniel S. Glaser: So basically, a lot of activity last year in M&A particularly in the back half of last year, which is not repeating and so that's a bit of a headwind overall. So nothing concerning. Do you have a follow-up, Elyse?\nElyse Greenspan: Yes, thanks. My follow-up question is on the outlook for Guy Carpenter. You guys mentioned the loss that we saw from Hurricane Ian. From what we've been hearing, it really has the potential to turn on the catastrophe reinsurance market significantly next year. So what are you guys seeing there and can you just talk about how Guy Carpenter could benefit from a pretty hard reinsurance market in 2023?\nDaniel S. Glaser: So why don't we start with John just to talk a little bit about the overall market, primary and reinsurance, and then we'll go to Dean. But John?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Sure. Thanks, Dan. So Elyse, the insurance markets remained challenging in the third quarter for our clients. Prices continued to rise in the quarter, although moderating slightly overall from where we were in the second quarter. Reinsurance markets though, are a different -- really a different matter. The property cat market in particular was tightening in advance of Ian. And then as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're likely headed to a much more challenging January 1 reinsurance renewal. So with that, maybe I'll ask Dean to jump in on some of the details of what we're seeing in the market today.\nDean Klisura: Thanks, John. As we look forward, demand for our advice and solutions remains very strong, and we feel we're very well positioned to continue to create value for clients and grow our business moving forward. Demand for reinsurance, including cat properties, is expected to remain very strong as our clients manage volatility and continue to address systemic risk, including cyber and the impacts of climate change and the emerging perils we're seeing around flood, wildfire, and convective storms around the world continue to accelerate and concern our clients. The impact of Ian will certainly create challenging market conditions at January 1 in the property cat space. But as John noted, a tightening cat market could be a tailwind for Guy Carpenter, but we have a track record of strong growth in any market conditions.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Terrific. Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about what we're starting to see in terms of the impact of Ian on the property markets, if -- that Marsh operates in, and then just probably what's happening in pricing in the marketplace?\nMartin South: Yes. Thanks, John. Well, we're into this -- into the 20th consecutive quarter of rate increases across the Board. We'll be announcing our rate survey at the end of -- in a couple of weeks' time. It will show 6% year-to-date in quarterly results in the property area. No question, there's going to be a strain in the property market, particularly for clients that have high cat exposures. We would have thought by now at this point in the cycle, after such consistent growth in property, that we have started to see some easing off. The reverse is going to be true, sadly, for our clients, going through for the back end of the year. Across the Board, though, rates, so I'll just -- I'll give you some color on those, John. The composite rate is 6%, which is down a little bit from the last quarter. Casualty is up 4% still, as I mentioned, property is 6%. FinPro [ph] lines are down 1%. They were heavily weighted in the prior year from -- and in the prior quarter from D&O SPACs and cyber. And we've broken out -- we will be breaking out cyber especially this year, which is showing rate increases of 53%, and that's down a little bit from rate increases in the prior quarter, but still very strong rate increases. And some of the activity we've seen there is slowing down a little bit. But it's a healthy market. But of course, we're worried about our clients. And as we said, we're going to be looking for solutions to plan them and we see that as a potential demand driver as well.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.\nJamminder Bhullar: Hey, good morning. I just had a question first on Oliver Wyman. I think there's concerns that if the economy slows down, that's a business that might be vulnerable to slower organic growth, but you've obviously had very strong results for the last several quarters. So if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of pipeline and just what your expectations are for the business?\nDaniel S. Glaser: Sure. As we've mentioned before, Oliver Wyman and Mercer's Career business are probably the most sensitive to the economic cycle, and it represents about 17% of our business. And both have been performing remarkably well over a long stretch of time. I mean, Mercer, as we mentioned earlier, Mercer's Career is up 15%, and it's their sixth quarter of double-digit growth in a row. And Oliver Wyman has had seven quarters of double-digit growth in a row. So if there are cloud somewhere in the future, we're not seeing them right today. But Nick, you want to give us more on Oliver Wyman?\nNick Studer: Thank you Jimmy, yes. It is true that our market tends to prosper when the economy is healthy. But at the same time, when all the questions change, our clients need nuances. And I will say we're not seeing any reversal in our business and our pipeline continues to be robust. As Dan and Martin both mentioned, the M&A and SPAC cycle, we have seen slower pace on the businesses that thrive on M&A activity, and I suspect we won't be immune to some of the tough elements in the cycle. But our client offerings are less pro-cyclical than they were perhaps five years ago. We have a strong capability in risk management, a lot of work in performance improvement, both top line and bottom line. We've established a restructuring practice, so -- and I'd add, it's actually been an incredibly tough environment for quite a few years now in several of the sectors we serve with the effects of the pandemic. So for now, the pipeline remains strong.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Yes. And the other thing about it is that even though the Career business and Oliver Wyman are more sensitive, they actually bounced back a lot quicker post a down cycle. So they're great businesses, we're glad we're in them. And overall, they provide us with leading growth over long stretches of time, and we're not overly concerned with short first. Do you have a follow-up, Jimmy?\nJamminder Bhullar: Yes. Just on fiduciary investment income. It's up, I think, around 10 times what it was a year ago and almost three times the sequential quarter. So obviously, there's a benefit there from higher interest rates, but wondering if that's all it is? And should we assume that it goes up further as rates have gone even higher since the end of the quarter or was there any sort of discrete items that benefited the 3Q results?\nDaniel S. Glaser: Well, it's nice to say it was up 10 times. It started from a very -- Mark, do you want to talk about fiduciary income?\nMark McGivney: Jimmy, there was nothing unusual or one-time in the results. So as you noted, we have $4 million a year ago in the third quarter, it was 40 million in this third quarter and it just reflects the rise in global rates, so it's definitely a source of upside for us. Obviously, we have balances all over the world, and so we're dependent on rates moving in different jurisdictions, but there's generally a trend up. And just remember, we've got over 10 billion of fiduciary balances on any given day, so 100 basis points equals 100 million of income.\nJamminder Bhullar: Noted. And good luck, and congratulations.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Thank you very much, Jimmy. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks, good morning. And Dan, congrats on the retirement. It's been quite a ride. Congrats.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Thanks, David.\nDavid Motemaden: Just had a question on the hiring activity that's been picking up. Obviously, the tough comp in the U.S. just on the M&A side in Marsh makes it a little tough to see any impact. But I was just wondering if you could just comment on how much this quarter benefited from some of the strategic hires that you've made over the last year and half, two years? And maybe give us a sense of how much that should ramp as we head into 2023?\nDaniel S. Glaser: Yes. So why don't we start with John, and maybe we'll go deeper. But John, why don't you take that?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Sure, Dan. David, we're very, very pleased. We continue to be just absolutely pleased with the strat hiring that we did last year. Not only are they producing, but we did a lot of work as we are hiring these folks to make sure that they're a right cultural fit, and that's proven to be the case as well. So we started with world-class talent. We think the best talent in the markets that we serve, and these folks have made us better. We serve our clients and teams, and they've fit in very, very nicely at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, where we did most of it. We did some of the hiring in Mercer as well. But Martin, maybe you could just talk about the productivity to the -- of the hires.\nMartin South: John, thank you. And as you said, very, very happy with the investments that we made last year. We -- the cultural accretion to us has been significant. They've brought new skills, new insights to the firm, and they've spread it out like wildfire. We focus very heavily on the investments, as you know, in areas where we thought there was high recurring revenue growth to the point the question was, yes, we see these ramping up. Everything is penciling out exactly as we thought it would. In some areas, we're actually ahead of plan, so we continue to see this as a continuing add to our revenue or growth and our capabilities. Couldn't be happier.\nJohn Q. Doyle: So as you know, David, it's two to three years before they are fully productive. But we couldn't be more pleased with the progress to date.\nDaniel S. Glaser: I don't want to sound like a Hollywood agent, but it is about the talent. We're a people business. It's the smart, dedicated, creative people attract other smart, dedicated and creative people. So we've got a mountain of talent within the company, and we would continue to build upon that. Do you have a follow-up, David?\nDavid Motemaden: I do, yes. And just on the property cat market on the reinsurance side, it sounds like that's spilling over a bit into cat exposed primary. I'm wondering if you're seeing that at all starting to spill over into non-property lines at all or if you expect that to happen?\nJohn Q. Doyle: David, not at this point, and I would say I wouldn't expect that to happen. Of course, things are -- haven't even yet begun to settle, so there's a lot for us to learn. But as I noted in my prepared comments, this is a major, major loss, and so it will impact both the insurance and reinsurance markets, but principally in property.\nDavid Motemaden: Understood, thank you.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Next question please. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you very much. Good morning everybody and I also want to congratulate Dan on a phenomenal career, and good luck in retirement. And good luck to John as well. Tough act to follow. I guess first question, going back to the reinsurance market and maybe the dislocation we're seeing in Florida, and more broadly in property cat. So I think I understand the rate environment, but at the same time, we're also hearing about maybe a dearth of capital, private reinsurance pulling out of the market, maybe public markets looking to take on some of that bucket, if you will. I guess, how are you envisioning the supply issue and how much of an impact could that have on overall growth next year? And related to that, I would think that a lot of your colleagues have actually never experienced a real hard market and certainly in Guy Carpenter. So how are you preparing them to address this new environment?\nDaniel S. Glaser: Yes, that's a good series of questions, and it's certainly something that's been at the executive team table as we think through how to serve clients in this kind of environment. We've been in tough markets before, but your basic point about supply and demand, yes. Demand will outstrip supply. It's already outstripping supply, so it's just an extent of how quickly the market can adapt to that. Dean, do you want to give us more?\nDean Klisura: Sure. Maybe I'll give you a little more color. Thanks, Dan. As John noted earlier, Ian's impact on already strapped property market could be significant. Prior to Ian, right, there seemed like there was increased demand from clients to absorb inflation and recent losses in the market, so we're already starting to feel that one-one stress. And as John noted, following Ian, we're really starting to see the property cat market tighten particularly in the U.S., with potential supply and balances in the marketplace. As you know, it's the third year in a row of $100 billion of cat losses in the market. And I would say it's going to be more, potentially more than just rate increases for U.S. cat exposed clients, right. Increased retentions, changes in coverage in terms, reduced capacity from individual players, and also the impact from the retrocession market, which could be significantly impacted as well. Some are discussing 25% of the retrocession capital being trapped by Ian and the market, and not replenished for January 1. So certainly, we've got some stresses there. However, I would say we're working very closely with our clients, leveraging our deep expertise in the market to work closely with clients to deliver successful incomes, and we're investigating new capacity in the marketplace. We've been working for several months with players around the world to bring more capital, more interest into the cat market on behalf of our clients.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Yes, absolutely. And so it's one of those things, very tough markets really, in some ways, it's the period where Marsh McLennan shines the most. And so Guy Carpenter will do well but in any time where there's supply and demand imbalances you could have short-term pressures of something not being able to be placed, because there's not enough capital providers willing to write a particular line of business. But solutions will be found, and we're actively working for our clients in that area. Any follow-up Yaron, although you asked about four questions. Give me another one, if you have one at the ready.\nYaron Kinar: I have one more, hopefully, shorter. Cyber, you mentioned very strong rate increases. I think that's also a continuation of a couple of years of strong rate improvement. That said, my understanding is that 2022 is starting to -- the loss experience is starting to moderate. How are you envisioning 2023 as far as rate increases and maybe increased demand, if rate increases are slower?\nDaniel S. Glaser: John?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes, Yaron, I'm going to forecast the pricing environment for cyber. Price increases are moderating. I think you used the word improving, but I'm not sure our clients would -- at Marsh, would consider it an improving rate environment. We've had a lot of rate on rate. It's been a difficult market. What I would also note about cyber, well, ransomware, to some extent, I think, reflective of the reduction in ransomware in recent quarters. Underwriters have also responded to ransomware through higher retentions, lower limits, for example. Longer term, though, the cyber market is not near maturity. And so we're still working to bring more capital to the market, better solutions to the marketplace. But the cyber insurance market should be an area of growth for us for some time as we help our clients navigate the risks of a digital economy.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Absolutely. Next question please. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks, good morning, and I want to add my congratulations to Dan. I remember where Marsh was when you first came on board. You've done an absolutely phenomenal job.\nDaniel S. Glaser: I had your headline from November of 2007, what else could go wrong? A statement, not a question. That was on my bulletin board for about five years there.\nMeyer Shields: Well yes. Anyhow, quick question. Look, I'm trying to decipher how much politics is real. But a fair amount of opposition brewing in some parts of the country to ESG, and I'm wondering how that's impacting demand for ESG-related consulting?\nDaniel S. Glaser: Sure. It's a great question. We're reading the same reports. Why don't we go first to Martine to talk a little bit about the Mercer investment side of the business and other areas of Mercer that are impacted, or that markets in ESG? And then we'll hand over to Nick Studer as well. But Martine?\nMartine Ferland: Yes, for sure. And thanks, Meyer, for the question. For us at Mercer in terms of environmental and social and governance, actually, we can work with clients on all three fronts; low-carbon economy, the transitions, sustainable investment. We help clients wherever they are in their philosophy of investment and their objectives to look at the market and the best risk and rewards [ph]. So our clients invest for the long run, and they look at the risk elements of their investment. And it's with that length that we're looking at the ESG factors with them. We don't see that kind of demand and necessity to look at risk. I mean, all through the Q&A today, we have talked about climate risk, for example. So we need to figure -- factor these risks in when we look at investment in all our clients get the returns that they're looking for. Other elements, of course, CE&I, social minimum standards of benefit across the world, so we pay equity. We have a lot of work there with our clients that are focused very much on building diverse workforces and the whole governance elements around it. Whether it goes from executive compensation, to the way that they manage and govern their investment. Actually coming back to investment, it's been quite a rough year on the capital market this new year. But we've been working with clients and actually, we've been very busy on the -- consulting side of the house, in particular, to help client navigate that very intense headwinds and volatility in capital markets.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Thanks. Nick?\nNick Studer: Yes. I mean, and Meyer, in Oliver Wyman, the main focus of the three would be around the climate transition, and I think that backlash that you're seeing in some places is something we've expected for quite a while. There is a delicate balance to strike in -- especially the carbon transition between security and affordability, and the transition itself. But ultimately, when many sectors are trying to reverse engineer 200 years since Industrial Revolution in 20 years, there'll be actions which overshoot, there will be actions which take on greater resistance. But as it affects our business, our climate of sustainability practice is one of the fastest-growing areas of Oliver Wyman, most investment we've made over the last three or four years, and it continues to grow in the very high double digits. We're not seeing any reduction in demand. We are seeing that the questions are getting more...\nDaniel S. Glaser: Yes. Thank you. Any follow-up?\nMeyer Shields: Yes, just a brief one, maybe this is for Mark. I was hoping you could talk us through capital deployment plans as the cost of capital is reflected in the risk-free rate rises?\nMark McGivney: Yes. Meyer, I don't -- even though interest rates have come up and obviously, the weighted average cost of capital for the firm has come up as a result, we tend to value balance and consistency in our approaches, and they've served us well over a long period of time. So even though things have gotten a little more expensive in economic terms, it isn't enough to make us change our fundamental views on capital allocation, capital structure, things like that. When it comes to M&A, we've held ourselves to much higher return standards than our weighted average cost of capital consistently, and we'll continue to do that. But I don't think there's anything about the current environment that makes us change our basic strategy.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Okay, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So Latin America and Asia Pacific have been particularly strong. I was wondering if we could get a little more color on what's driving that relative to the U.S., is it higher inflation, higher pricing, market share gains, anything -- any color on that would be great?\nDaniel S. Glaser: Sure. We'll begin with Martin in a second. I mean, in general, what we've seen in -- over, really, the last couple of decades is that you not only have regular higher levels of growth and a bit more inflation sometimes over long stretches of time in places like Asia and Latin America, but you also have increased insurance penetration. As the economy develops insurance becomes the underpinning for development, and so that has always been a benefit to us as well. Martin, do you want to give us more?\nMartin South: Yes. Thank you. And look, for the last few years as well, you've seen international has been slightly weaker than the U.S. That's rebounding, and we best to balance things so strong in our portfolio, so we're really pleased with the overall balance in our business. As Dan said, for Asia Pacific, very strong growth of 14%. We have a terrific franchise in Asia Pacific, pretty well unrivaled positions in almost all the markets there. So you could not buy what we have in that market. It's a mixture of in Japan, maturities and us having been there for such a long period of time and building the trust with the local community, and the carriers and doing more indigenous business. It's the protection gap that you see across Southeast Asia that's giving us share, it's strength in our benefits business across Asia, and the same for Latin America. We have an unbelievable franchise there, very strong businesses in all the big geographies in all the big markets in Latin America. There's some great strength there, but it's been relatively modest for a while. It's really a question of just getting market share and strength and a terrific leadership team.\nJohn Q. Doyle: And Dan, I would add that JLT made us stronger in both regions as well. Absolutely.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Any follow-up, Robert?\nRobert Cox: Yes. Thanks, that's very helpful. And I just had a follow-up on Career. So there's been some favorable trends in Career driven by some of the changing dynamics in the labor market. How sustainable are those trends if unemployment rises a couple of points, could you still see strong growth given those underlying changes, or is that too optimistic?\nDaniel S. Glaser: Martine?\nMartine Ferland: Yes. Thank you for the question, Robert. No, it's a good question. There's no doubt that coming out of the pandemic, the world of work has completely changed, and that has driven demand. But you look at all that's currently playing out, whether it's high inflation, it's labor shortage, it's emerging new skills that we have to help clients gravitate to reorganizing the way that you work. So we have talked before about the impact that recession has had in the past on the Career Services business. There's also the Career Product business, about half and half of revenue in that space. Career Product is actually more resilient through recessions. And Career Services, given the fundamentals that we see in the market today, we currently don't see any slowdown. Clients are really needing help to navigate all of the changes. We're not immune to a change in economic pace, but we rebound quickly, and we've -- we'll carry through. So, so far, so good.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Thank you. Next question please. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. And also just want to congratulate to Dan, and I want to echo Meyer's comments. It's an absolute pleasure watching you lead this organization for the last decade. Question for you first, M&A. What does the pipeline look like right now and particularly, as we kind of look at M&A here with private equity may be cooling off a little bit here, becoming a little more challenging, are you seeing a better pipeline here? And I'm assuming that John wants to outdo you on JLT here pretty quickly?\nDaniel S. Glaser: Yes. Looking at his chops over there. No, the M&A pipeline is good. We -- as we've said a few times before in the past, we cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. We're less interested in the call from a banker saying, hey, something's going to market, we're inviting 10 people. You want to participate? And so for us, pipeline development and meeting as a core executive team on a regular cadence to review the pipeline and talk to potential prospects in the future, that's just a part of how we go about the business. As you know, we favor building our business through acquisition over share repurchase, but they sort of go in tandem. When we have a lighter year in M&A, we'll have more share repurchase sort of like this year when we have a heavy year in M&A, we'd have less share repurchase because our dividend is -- comes first and is sacrosanct. So when we look at the pipeline, the pipeline is good. We have a transaction that we've mentioned to you before in BT Westpac [ph] which won't close until next year. But still when we're thinking about the utilization of our capital, we're pretty much thinking that it's kind of well, it's partly this year and its partly next year regardless of when the cash goes out the door. And as you know, we've sort of average, if you exclude JLT, we've sort of averaged about $1 billion a year on acquisitions, and that's likely to continue.\nBrian Meredith: Makes sense. Thanks. And then a quick follow-up here for Mark. Mark, any initial kind of thoughts on what the net benefit from pension could look like in 2023, given the big rise we've seen -- interest rates?\nMark McGivney: Brian, it's just really too early to tell. There's so much that goes into that that calculation of the other net benefit credit. It's really not until we see, with Mercer's great help, of course, the outlook for expected returns and our year-end valuation that we really formulate a view on that. So I think when we were back together in January, I'll have a perspective then. \nBrian Meredith: Great, thank you. \nDaniel S. Glaser: Thank you, take care. Next question please. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Phillips: Thanks, good morning. First question is still back on the theme of property cat reinsurance, guys. How much of a real risk has it been that some business just simply is not going to get placed at the beginning of the year? And then how material could that be?\nDaniel S. Glaser: John, do you want to start with that?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes, Mike, happy to jump back in on this. Again, it's still quite early, and so I think most reinsurers and insurers are planning and trying to decide how to best deploy capital going forward. As we, Dean and Dan and I have all discussed, we expect some level of disruption. It's going to be a challenging market. But again, we're using the capabilities of our entire firm to bring solutions to the market. Data and analytics, new investors, new facilities. And in some cases, it may mean clients retaining more risk, both insurers but also our retail clients as well. And we're the global leader in managing captives on behalf of our clients, and so it's an example. Now some of our clients may be pushed by the market to do that, and some may choose just given what might be elevated pricing, may more elect themselves to retain more risk. So we're going to work with them to help all of our clients accomplish their risk management goals.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thank you. And then as you said, the property cat market was certainly hardening a bit before Ian, I think we were here in kind of low single digits -- I'm sorry, double-digit, but now we're hearing pretty massive increases. The question is, is that strict -- are those levels that we're hearing, pick a number, 30%, 40%, 50%, I don't care the number you would pick, but is that strictly just Florida or do you see such levels as well outside of Florida around the world?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Well, Mike, I think what you've seen over the last several years is cat losses have exceeded modeled estimates. So the market is underpriced, insurers and reinsurers broadly have underpriced the risk over that period of time, right. You can look at an extended period of time and, of course, get different outcomes. So the market is reacting to that. So you've also had an escalation of values that's happened in many cat-exposed markets as well. And then broadly speaking, inflation, creating some challenges.  So as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're heading to meaningful rate change prior to Ian in the 20%, 25% plus of range to cover inflation and against just the elevated weather-related events over the last several years. Now it's likely to, of course, be higher than that. And so in talking to reinsurers and insurers they're thinking about, again, about how to best deploy their capital going forward. They're in the business of taking these risks and will ultimately make choices about where to best deploy that capital. And what they're saying today is they want to reserve it for their best clients. On the reinsurance side, that might mean clients that they also support them in casualty and other lines as an example. And so thinking about Marsh for a second, it's an interesting market. We have a high net worth personal lines support inside of M&A, important business to us. This loss is going to be more of a small business and personal line loss, and so it won't impact our major accounts and really as much as other events have.\nMichael Phillips: Okay, thank you for the color. I appreciate it. \nDaniel S. Glaser: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: Hey guys, good morning. Just a follow-up on the fiduciary investment income. So we've had a number of years of really strong margin expansion where that hasn't played a role at all. Is it right, am I thinking about this right that this should be a kind of a separate and distinct margin tailwind on top of the type of margin expansion that we've seen over the past decade or is there investment potentially against some of that investment income? \nDaniel S. Glaser: I mean, you're basically right in that fiduciary income, we didn't have. A lot of it is -- drops to the bottom line. So a lot of it is profit, and that will help margins in the future.\nRyan Tunis: Perfect. And then a follow-up, I guess, for Martine, just in wealth, is there -- is there any way you can quantify with markets rolling over the type of impact that's having on organic growth?\nDaniel S. Glaser: Please.\nMartine Ferland: Yes. No, thanks, Ryan. It has an impact. We commented on it, and as you can imagine, it's our what we call our OCIO business where we are paid in this point of the assets under management. It has been a very good business to us. It's been growing rapidly, but it is exposed to short-term volatility from capital markets. And based on the market value that we see at the end of Q3, we do expect a drag from capital markets to continue in the fourth quarter, as a reference, and I think we alluded to that in our script. In Q3, this has cost us about two points of margin at Mercer, four points on Wealth. [Multiple Speakers].\nDaniel S. Glaser: So Mercer would have been more like a 7 instead of a 5, not 4.\nMartine Ferland: Yes. And we had 15% in Career and 10% in health, rounding this up. And also, it does help us on the DB [ph] consulting side where we consult with client when there's such impact on the capital market. Our portfolio is diversified, so that helps. We had also a great net -- coming to our funds, which will [Technical Difficulty].\nDaniel S. Glaser: Okay. So it's a terrific business, Ryan. As we noted, the assets under delegated management are down about 20% year-over-year. But having said that, if you look over the decade -- over a decade, the CAGR on assets under delegated management is about a 20% number on a CAGR basis. So it's a great business. We're glad we're in it. But obviously, it's a headwind in the short term. Hopefully, in the short term.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan, for any closing remarks.\nDaniel S. Glaser: Thank you, and thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 86,000 colleagues for their commitment, hard work, and dedication to Marsh McLennan. And from the bottom of my heart, thank you for the trust you have put in me. Serving as CEO of Marsh McLennan has been an honor. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "John Q. Doyle",
            "content": "Thanks Dan and good morning everyone. I am honored to become Marsh McLennan's next President and CEO, and grateful for the trust and confidence Dan and the Board have placed in me to lead this exceptional company. I'm eager to work with our colleagues in realizing new possibilities to serve our clients, create value for our shareholders, and support our communities.  I'm pleased with our third quarter results. We delivered strong growth despite a macro backdrop that is becoming more uncertain. We are delivering solutions to help clients navigate volatile economic, geopolitical, and risk landscape. As we discussed last quarter, there are aspects of the current environment that remains supportive of our growth. Higher inflation offsets lower real GDP growth, rising interest rates, boost our fiduciary income, and the challenging insurance market drives a flight to quality. We also have a track record of success and being resilient through cycles, and I believe Marsh McLennan is well positioned to perform. I would like to take a moment to discuss Hurricane Ian, that's had a devastating impact on the people and communities in Florida. Ian has the potential to be the costliest insured event in Florida's history and the second most damaging insured loss of all time. We are working with insurers to help our clients receive much-needed support. Insurance has a critical role to play in building homes and restoring shuttered businesses. Our work reinforces Marsh McLennan's purpose to be there in the moments that matter for our clients and communities.  Ian's Category 4 strength, incredible size, and slow pace resulted in tremendous damage. The cost of which is exacerbated by the effects of coastal development, the escalation of property values, general inflation, and persistent supply chain challenges. While the ultimate insured loss won't be known for some time, the impact on an already stressed property market will be significant. At mid-year reinsurance renewals, property market is already exhibiting strains. Following Ian, the property cat market is likely to tighten even further and perhaps see a significant supply-demand imbalance. We are harnessing our collective expertise, scale and capabilities to bring solutions to help our clients navigate this complex risk environment. Turning to our third quarter financial performance, we generated strong results. Adjusted EPS of $1.18 is up 9% versus a year ago, which is impressive on top of 32% growth in the third quarter of 2021. Total revenue increased 4% versus a year ago and rose 8% on an underlying basis, with 9% in RIS and 8% in Consulting. This is a terrific result, especially considering the prior year third quarter underlying growth of 13%. Marsh had an excellent quarter. Growth was 8%, reflecting new business and strong renewal growth. Guy Carpenter grew 7% [ph] in the quarter, continuing its string of terrific results. Mercer grew 5% in the quarter despite capital market headwinds, and Oliver Wyman grew 13%, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 12% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Overall, I am proud of our third quarter performance, which demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business. Given our strong third quarter and year-to-date performance, we are on track for an outstanding year. We expect to generate high single-digit growth, underlying revenue, solid growth adjusted EPS and to report margin expansion for the 15th consecutive year. We are focused, aligned and succeeding together, as our results demonstrate. Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to say a few words about Dan. During Dan's tenure at the helm of Marsh McLennan, the company has been transformed. Our revenue has nearly doubled, our adjusted EPS has more than tripled, and our market cap has quadrupled. Our scale and capabilities have been enhanced, and our talent is unmatched. Dan led our expansion into new client segments and launched Marsh McLennan Agency, which has grown to $2.5 billion of annual revenue, closed 100 acquisitions at just over a decade. Dan also successfully led the company's $5.6 billion acquisition, JLT in 2019, the largest in our history. Most importantly, Dan has led our firm with vision, courage and integrity. Faced with the consequences of the pandemic, his values-first leadership ensured that the tough choices were made to safeguard our colleagues, to protect jobs and incomes, deliver for clients, bolster liquidity, and still produce significant growth. His decision were an inspiration to our colleagues and an example to the broader business community. Our financial performance speaks for itself, with Marsh McLennan's total shareholder return more than doubling the S&P 500 during Dan's stewardship as CEO. Less visible but even more significant is the sense of pride and the culture that Dan has instilled in the firm. Under his leadership, we are not only a great stock but a great company. We owe him our gratitude. So on behalf of our 86,000 colleagues, I thank Dan for his leadership. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2022. Sure. Thanks, Dan. So Elyse, the insurance markets remained challenging in the third quarter for our clients. Prices continued to rise in the quarter, although moderating slightly overall from where we were in the second quarter. Reinsurance markets though, are a different -- really a different matter. The property cat market in particular was tightening in advance of Ian. And then as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're likely headed to a much more challenging January 1 reinsurance renewal. So with that, maybe I'll ask Dean to jump in on some of the details of what we're seeing in the market today. Terrific. Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about what we're starting to see in terms of the impact of Ian on the property markets, if -- that Marsh operates in, and then just probably what's happening in pricing in the marketplace? Sure, Dan. David, we're very, very pleased. We continue to be just absolutely pleased with the strat hiring that we did last year. Not only are they producing, but we did a lot of work as we are hiring these folks to make sure that they're a right cultural fit, and that's proven to be the case as well. So we started with world-class talent. We think the best talent in the markets that we serve, and these folks have made us better. We serve our clients and teams, and they've fit in very, very nicely at both Marsh and Guy Carpenter, where we did most of it. We did some of the hiring in Mercer as well. But Martin, maybe you could just talk about the productivity to the -- of the hires. So as you know, David, it's two to three years before they are fully productive. But we couldn't be more pleased with the progress to date. David, not at this point, and I would say I wouldn't expect that to happen. Of course, things are -- haven't even yet begun to settle, so there's a lot for us to learn. But as I noted in my prepared comments, this is a major, major loss, and so it will impact both the insurance and reinsurance markets, but principally in property. Yes, Yaron, I'm going to forecast the pricing environment for cyber. Price increases are moderating. I think you used the word improving, but I'm not sure our clients would -- at Marsh, would consider it an improving rate environment. We've had a lot of rate on rate. It's been a difficult market. What I would also note about cyber, well, ransomware, to some extent, I think, reflective of the reduction in ransomware in recent quarters. Underwriters have also responded to ransomware through higher retentions, lower limits, for example. Longer term, though, the cyber market is not near maturity. And so we're still working to bring more capital to the market, better solutions to the marketplace. But the cyber insurance market should be an area of growth for us for some time as we help our clients navigate the risks of a digital economy. And Dan, I would add that JLT made us stronger in both regions as well. Absolutely. Yes, Mike, happy to jump back in on this. Again, it's still quite early, and so I think most reinsurers and insurers are planning and trying to decide how to best deploy capital going forward. As we, Dean and Dan and I have all discussed, we expect some level of disruption. It's going to be a challenging market. But again, we're using the capabilities of our entire firm to bring solutions to the market. Data and analytics, new investors, new facilities. And in some cases, it may mean clients retaining more risk, both insurers but also our retail clients as well. And we're the global leader in managing captives on behalf of our clients, and so it's an example. Now some of our clients may be pushed by the market to do that, and some may choose just given what might be elevated pricing, may more elect themselves to retain more risk. So we're going to work with them to help all of our clients accomplish their risk management goals. Well, Mike, I think what you've seen over the last several years is cat losses have exceeded modeled estimates. So the market is underpriced, insurers and reinsurers broadly have underpriced the risk over that period of time, right. You can look at an extended period of time and, of course, get different outcomes. So the market is reacting to that. So you've also had an escalation of values that's happened in many cat-exposed markets as well. And then broadly speaking, inflation, creating some challenges.  So as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're heading to meaningful rate change prior to Ian in the 20%, 25% plus of range to cover inflation and against just the elevated weather-related events over the last several years. Now it's likely to, of course, be higher than that. And so in talking to reinsurers and insurers they're thinking about, again, about how to best deploy their capital going forward. They're in the business of taking these risks and will ultimately make choices about where to best deploy that capital. And what they're saying today is they want to reserve it for their best clients. On the reinsurance side, that might mean clients that they also support them in casualty and other lines as an example. And so thinking about Marsh for a second, it's an interesting market. We have a high net worth personal lines support inside of M&A, important business to us. This loss is going to be more of a small business and personal line loss, and so it won't impact our major accounts and really as much as other events have."

            "content": "Thanks, John. As we look forward, demand for our advice and solutions remains very strong, and we feel we're very well positioned to continue to create value for clients and grow our business moving forward. Demand for reinsurance, including cat properties, is expected to remain very strong as our clients manage volatility and continue to address systemic risk, including cyber and the impacts of climate change and the emerging perils we're seeing around flood, wildfire, and convective storms around the world continue to accelerate and concern our clients. The impact of Ian will certainly create challenging market conditions at January 1 in the property cat space. But as John noted, a tightening cat market could be a tailwind for Guy Carpenter, but we have a track record of strong growth in any market conditions. Sure. Maybe I'll give you a little more color. Thanks, Dan. As John noted earlier, Ian's impact on already strapped property market could be significant. Prior to Ian, right, there seemed like there was increased demand from clients to absorb inflation and recent losses in the market, so we're already starting to feel that one-one stress. And as John noted, following Ian, we're really starting to see the property cat market tighten particularly in the U.S., with potential supply and balances in the marketplace. As you know, it's the third year in a row of $100 billion of cat losses in the market. And I would say it's going to be more, potentially more than just rate increases for U.S. cat exposed clients, right. Increased retentions, changes in coverage in terms, reduced capacity from individual players, and also the impact from the retrocession market, which could be significantly impacted as well. Some are discussing 25% of the retrocession capital being trapped by Ian and the market, and not replenished for January 1. So certainly, we've got some stresses there. However, I would say we're working very closely with our clients, leveraging our deep expertise in the market to work closely with clients to deliver successful incomes, and we're investigating new capacity in the marketplace. We've been working for several months with players around the world to bring more capital, more interest into the cat market on behalf of our clients."

And I will say we're not seeing any reversal in our business and our pipeline continues to be robust. As Dan and Martin both mentioned, the M&A and SPAC cycle, we have seen slower pace on the businesses that thrive on M&A activity, and I suspect we won't be immune to some of the tough elements in the cycle. But our client offerings are less pro-cyclical than they were perhaps five years ago. We have a strong capability in risk management, a lot of work in performance improvement, both top line and bottom line. We've established a restructuring practice, so -- and I'd add, it's actually been an incredibly tough environment for quite a few years now in several of the sectors we serve with the effects of the pandemic. So for now, the pipeline remains strong. Yes. I mean, and Meyer, in Oliver Wyman, the main focus of the three would be around the climate transition, and I think that backlash that you're seeing in some places is something we've expected for quite a while. There is a delicate balance to strike in -- especially the carbon transition between security and affordability, and the transition itself. But ultimately, when many sectors are trying to reverse engineer 200 years since Industrial Revolution in 20 years, there'll be actions which overshoot, there will be actions which take on greater resistance. But as it affects our business, our climate of sustainability practice is one of the fastest-growing areas of Oliver Wyman, most investment we've made over the last three or four years, and it continues to grow in the very high double digits. We're not seeing any reduction in demand. We are seeing that the questions are getting more..."

            "name": "Martin South",
            "content": "Thank you, Dan. Yes. Just to start, we are very pleased with the strong organic growth of 8% in the quarter, which is on top of 13% in the prior quarter 2021. Our growth is strong across all the geographies. EMEA was up 9%, Asia Pac, 14%, LAC was up 15% -- 5%, as you noted in the U.S. Overall, good year-to-date growth of 9%. And whilst the 5% is a slowdown, it was 16% in Q3 of 2021. When we look at the U.S. over a longer period, the U.S. and Canada is 8% year-to-date and 13% in the full year of 2021. Canada is doing extremely well, and the U.S. growth last year in the back half of the year, there was exceptional performance in M&A, SPAC, and capital markets activity, and we don't see that repeating in the volatility of the markets going forward. We made fantastic investments last year in producers that are focused on recurring business, so we feel we're very well positioned in the U.S. going forward. Yes. Thanks, John. Well, we're into this -- into the 20th consecutive quarter of rate increases across the Board. We'll be announcing our rate survey at the end of -- in a couple of weeks' time. It will show 6% year-to-date in quarterly results in the property area. No question, there's going to be a strain in the property market, particularly for clients that have high cat exposures. We would have thought by now at this point in the cycle, after such consistent growth in property, that we have started to see some easing off. The reverse is going to be true, sadly, for our clients, going through for the back end of the year. Across the Board, though, rates, so I'll just -- I'll give you some color on those, John. The composite rate is 6%, which is down a little bit from the last quarter. Casualty is up 4% still, as I mentioned, property is 6%. FinPro [ph] lines are down 1%. They were heavily weighted in the prior year from -- and in the prior quarter from D&O SPACs and cyber. And we've broken out -- we will be breaking out cyber especially this year, which is showing rate increases of 53%, and that's down a little bit from rate increases in the prior quarter, but still very strong rate increases. And some of the activity we've seen there is slowing down a little bit. But it's a healthy market. But of course, we're worried about our clients. And as we said, we're going to be looking for solutions to plan them and we see that as a potential demand driver as well. John, thank you. And as you said, very, very happy with the investments that we made last year. We -- the cultural accretion to us has been significant. They've brought new skills, new insights to the firm, and they've spread it out like wildfire. We focus very heavily on the investments, as you know, in areas where we thought there was high recurring revenue growth to the point the question was, yes, we see these ramping up. Everything is penciling out exactly as we thought it would. In some areas, we're actually ahead of plan, so we continue to see this as a continuing add to our revenue or growth and our capabilities. Couldn't be happier. Yes. Thank you. And look, for the last few years as well, you've seen international has been slightly weaker than the U.S. That's rebounding, and we best to balance things so strong in our portfolio, so we're really pleased with the overall balance in our business. As Dan said, for Asia Pacific, very strong growth of 14%. We have a terrific franchise in Asia Pacific, pretty well unrivaled positions in almost all the markets there. So you could not buy what we have in that market. It's a mixture of in Japan, maturities and us having been there for such a long period of time and building the trust with the local community, and the carriers and doing more indigenous business. It's the protection gap that you see across Southeast Asia that's giving us share, it's strength in our benefits business across Asia, and the same for Latin America. We have an unbelievable franchise there, very strong businesses in all the big geographies in all the big markets in Latin America. There's some great strength there, but it's been relatively modest for a while. It's really a question of just getting market share and strength and a terrific leadership team."

            "content": "Thank you, John and good morning. As Dan and John mentioned, our performance in the third quarter reflects continued momentum across our business. We saw another quarter of strong underlying revenue growth, meaningful earnings growth despite tough revenue and expense comparisons. Consolidated revenue increased 4% to $4.8 billion and reflected underlying growth of 8%. Operating income was 791 million, adjusted operating income was 851 million. Our adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, up 110 [ph] basis points from last year. The increase was driven by modest operating leverage and a benefit from foreign exchange. We generated GAAP EPS of $1.08 in the quarter, adjusted EPS of $1.18 up 9% yearly [ph]. For the first nine months of 2022, underlying revenue growth was 9%, our adjusted operating income rose 11% to $3.7 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 25.6%, and our adjusted EPS increased 12% to $5.38. Looking at Risk & Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $2.8 billion, up 6% compared with the year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Operating income increased 32% to 529 million. Adjusted operating income increased 20% to 562 million, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 200 basis points to 22.4%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue was 9.7 billion, underlying growth 10%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months increased 13% to $2.8 billion, with a margin of 31.1%, up 80 basis points from the same period in 2021. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, 5% from a year ago. Revenue growth of 8% on an underlying basis supported by strong retention and [Technical Difficulty]. U.S. and Canada had 5% underlying growth, a solid result considering a 16% growth in the third quarter of 2021 that included the benefit of significant M&A and SPAC-related activity. International underlying growth was 11%. Latin America grew 15%, Asia Pacific was up 14%, EMEA was up 9%. First nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was 7.8 billion, underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada was up 8%, International grew 10%. Guy Carpenter's third quarter revenue was 328 million [ph], up 7% on an underlying basis, reflecting solid production and retention. Guy Carpenter has now achieved underlying revenue growth of 7% or higher in six of the last seven quarters. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Partner generated 1.8 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth [ph]. In the Consulting segment, revenue of 2 billion was up 1% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis, building on 12% in the third quarter of 2021. Operating income decreased 14% to 350 million, reflecting a one-time noteworthy benefit a year ago. Adjusted operating income increased 3% to 362 million, where solid earnings growth was masked by a drag from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin expanded 20 basis points to 19.1%. Consulting generated revenue of 6 billion for the first nine months of 2022, an underlying growth of 9%. Adjusted operating income for the first nine months of the year increased 5% to 1.1 billion, the adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, flat versus the third quarter of 2021. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the third quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis, which is impressive given the impact of market declines on our investments. Career grew 15% on an underlying basis, a sixth consecutive quarter of mid to high-teens growth. We continue to see strong demand for solutions in workforce transformation as well as compensation and rewards. Health underlying growth was also excellent at 10% in the quarter, reflecting strength across all geographies. Wealth decreased 1% on an underlying basis due to declines in both equity and fixed income markets. This market impact represented a 2% headwind to Mercer's overall growth for the quarter. However, solid demand and defined benefits helped mitigate [indiscernible]. Our assets under management was $318 billion at the end of the third quarter, down 8% sequentially and 20% from the third quarter of last year, due entirely to market declines and foreign exchange. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $4 billion, up 6% from underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's strong momentum continued. Revenue in the third quarter was $667 million, an increase of 13% on an underlying growth. This comes on top of 25% of the third quarter last year and reflects continued strong demand across most geographies against solutions. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was 2 billion, increase of 15% on underlying growth. Adjusted corporate expense was 73 million in the third quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately 80 million for the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange had an immaterial effect on our adjusted EPS in the third quarter, although year-to-date, you can assess a headwind of 7% [ph]. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a headwind of $0.07 in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was 57 billion. For the full year 2022, we expect our other net benefit credit be around 230 million [ph]. We reported an investment loss of 1 million in the third quarter on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, we had investment income of $3 million [ph]. Interest expense in the third quarter was 118 million compared to 107 million in the third quarter of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense of 121 million in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 24.6% compared with 24.4% in the third quarter of last year, included a modest net benefit of discrete items [ph]. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was 25% for the quarter. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, not project discrete items, which is positive or negative. Based on the current environment, reasonable to assume an adjusted effective tax rate of 25% for the full year 2022. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of 11.4 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity March of 2023 with 350 million of senior notes. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was 802 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled 931 million, included 293 million of dividends, 138 million for acquisitions, 500 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled 2.9 billion, included 840 million for dividends, 411 million for acquisitions, 1.6 billion of share repurchase. We continue to expect to deploy approximately 4 billion of cap in 2022 plus dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Overall, we remain on track for a terrific 2022. For the full year, we expect to generate high single-digit growth in underlying revenue, solid growth in adjusted EPS, and to report margin expansion for 15th consecutive year. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back. Jimmy, there was nothing unusual or one-time in the results. So as you noted, we have $4 million a year ago in the third quarter, it was 40 million in this third quarter and it just reflects the rise in global rates, so it's definitely a source of upside for us. Obviously, we have balances all over the world, and so we're dependent on rates moving in different jurisdictions, but there's generally a trend up. And just remember, we've got over 10 billion of fiduciary balances on any given day, so 100 basis points equals 100 million of income. Yes. Meyer, I don't -- even though interest rates have come up and obviously, the weighted average cost of capital for the firm has come up as a result, we tend to value balance and consistency in our approaches, and they've served us well over a long period of time. So even though things have gotten a little more expensive in economic terms, it isn't enough to make us change our fundamental views on capital allocation, capital structure, things like that. When it comes to M&A, we've held ourselves to much higher return standards than our weighted average cost of capital consistently, and we'll continue to do that. But I don't think there's anything about the current environment that makes us change our basic strategy. Brian, it's just really too early to tell. There's so much that goes into that that calculation of the other net benefit credit. It's really not until we see, with Mercer's great help, of course, the outlook for expected returns and our year-end valuation that we really formulate a view on that. So I think when we were back together in January, I'll have a perspective then."

            "name": "Daniel S. Glaser",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Today is my 60th earnings call at Marsh McLennan, and 40th as CEO. After 10 years as President and CEO, I will be retiring from Marsh McLennan at the end of the year. Leading this firm over the past decade has been the honor of a lifetime. Before I jump into our results, I'd like to say how pleased I am about the leadership succession we announced. The appointment of John Doyle as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1st continues to underscore Marsh McLennan's deep trove of industry-leading talent. During John's tenure as President and CEO of Marsh, he drove exceptional revenue and earnings growth. And as Group President and COO, John is finding new ways to harness the capabilities of Marsh McLennan across our business, accelerating impact for clients, colleagues and communities. John has been an indispensable partner to me and the other members of our Executive Committee in shaping and executing our strategy. He knows our business well and is focused on delivering outstanding performance for clients and shareholders. I am confident that our extraordinary success will continue under John's leadership. Marsh McLennan's third quarter results demonstrated strength on strength. Top line momentum continued across our business, extending the best run of quarterly underlying growth in over two decades. We generated strong top and bottom line results despite difficult year-over-year comparison. Underlying growth of 8% in the quarter reflects considerable strength across our organization. It represents the sixth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher top line growth, building on 13% growth a year ago. Adjusted operating income of $851 million was a third quarter record, and grew 12% on top of 19% in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS growth of 9% is excellent, especially given costs related to our strategic talent investments, the rebound of T&E, and 32% growth in the third quarter of 2021. We completed 500 million of share repurchases in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 1.6 billion, which is higher than any full year level of repurchases in our history. While the economic and geopolitical backdrop is uncertain, we have a proven track record of being resilient through cycles and are well positioned. Overall, our third quarter performance highlights the strength of Marsh McLennan, a critical nature of what we do for our clients and the unmatched expertise of our colleagues. With that let me turn it over to John. Thank you, Mark. Before we open up the call for Q&A, I just want to say it has been a great privilege to lead this firm and work side-by-side with smart, creative and dedicated people. I am immensely proud of our colleagues and what we have accomplished. Together, we've grown, innovated and persevered. We launched and built MMA, expanded our capabilities in combination with JLT, and demonstrated resilience in the face of a financial crisis and global pandemic. We emerged as a better and stronger firm by relying on each other, living our values, supporting our communities, and staying focused on clients. I have always believed the greatness of our companies is in how we deliver in the big moments and the small. Under John's leadership, I know Marsh McLennan will continue to thrive and prosper, to make a difference in the moments that matter. There is no one I trust more with the company we've built together, and with the important work ahead. I'd like to thank our clients for choosing to do business with us, our shareholders for their continued confidence, most importantly our colleagues. All that we have achieved is due to their efforts. With that, operator, we are ready to begin Q&A. Thanks, Elyse and I appreciate your comments. So thank you very much, and I hope to keep in touch with you. So let me just start out. I'll hand off to Martin in a second. Obviously, Marsh has been doing fantastically well, and U.S., Canada has done well as well. So I would just start by saying that the comparable was pretty tough at 16% growth in U.S., Canada last year. But Martin, do you want to dig in and give a little bit more color? So basically, a lot of activity last year in M&A particularly in the back half of last year, which is not repeating and so that's a bit of a headwind overall. So nothing concerning. Do you have a follow-up, Elyse? So why don't we start with John just to talk a little bit about the overall market, primary and reinsurance, and then we'll go to Dean. But John? Next question please. Sure. As we've mentioned before, Oliver Wyman and Mercer's Career business are probably the most sensitive to the economic cycle, and it represents about 17% of our business. And both have been performing remarkably well over a long stretch of time. I mean, Mercer, as we mentioned earlier, Mercer's Career is up 15%, and it's their sixth quarter of double-digit growth in a row. And Oliver Wyman has had seven quarters of double-digit growth in a row. So if there are cloud somewhere in the future, we're not seeing them right today. But Nick, you want to give us more on Oliver Wyman? Yes. And the other thing about it is that even though the Career business and Oliver Wyman are more sensitive, they actually bounced back a lot quicker post a down cycle. So they're great businesses, we're glad we're in them. And overall, they provide us with leading growth over long stretches of time, and we're not overly concerned with short first. Do you have a follow-up, Jimmy? Well, it's nice to say it was up 10 times. It started from a very -- Mark, do you want to talk about fiduciary income? Thank you very much, Jimmy. Next question please. Thanks, David. Yes. So why don't we start with John, and maybe we'll go deeper. But John, why don't you take that? I don't want to sound like a Hollywood agent, but it is about the talent. We're a people business. It's the smart, dedicated, creative people attract other smart, dedicated and creative people. So we've got a mountain of talent within the company, and we would continue to build upon that. Do you have a follow-up, David? Next question please. Yes, that's a good series of questions, and it's certainly something that's been at the executive team table as we think through how to serve clients in this kind of environment. We've been in tough markets before, but your basic point about supply and demand, yes. Demand will outstrip supply. It's already outstripping supply, so it's just an extent of how quickly the market can adapt to that. Dean, do you want to give us more? Yes, absolutely. And so it's one of those things, very tough markets really, in some ways, it's the period where Marsh McLennan shines the most. And so Guy Carpenter will do well but in any time where there's supply and demand imbalances you could have short-term pressures of something not being able to be placed, because there's not enough capital providers willing to write a particular line of business. But solutions will be found, and we're actively working for our clients in that area. Any follow-up Yaron, although you asked about four questions. Give me another one, if you have one at the ready. John? Absolutely. Next question please. I had your headline from November of 2007, what else could go wrong? A statement, not a question. That was on my bulletin board for about five years there. Sure. It's a great question. We're reading the same reports. Why don't we go first to Martine to talk a little bit about the Mercer investment side of the business and other areas of Mercer that are impacted, or that markets in ESG? And then we'll hand over to Nick Studer as well. But Martine? Thanks. Nick? Yes. Thank you. Any follow-up? Okay, next question please. Sure. We'll begin with Martin in a second. I mean, in general, what we've seen in -- over, really, the last couple of decades is that you not only have regular higher levels of growth and a bit more inflation sometimes over long stretches of time in places like Asia and Latin America, but you also have increased insurance penetration. As the economy develops insurance becomes the underpinning for development, and so that has always been a benefit to us as well. Martin, do you want to give us more? Any follow-up, Robert? Martine? Thank you. Next question please. Yes. Looking at his chops over there. No, the M&A pipeline is good. We -- as we've said a few times before in the past, we cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. We're less interested in the call from a banker saying, hey, something's going to market, we're inviting 10 people. You want to participate? And so for us, pipeline development and meeting as a core executive team on a regular cadence to review the pipeline and talk to potential prospects in the future, that's just a part of how we go about the business. As you know, we favor building our business through acquisition over share repurchase, but they sort of go in tandem. When we have a lighter year in M&A, we'll have more share repurchase sort of like this year when we have a heavy year in M&A, we'd have less share repurchase because our dividend is -- comes first and is sacrosanct. So when we look at the pipeline, the pipeline is good. We have a transaction that we've mentioned to you before in BT Westpac [ph] which won't close until next year. But still when we're thinking about the utilization of our capital, we're pretty much thinking that it's kind of well, it's partly this year and its partly next year regardless of when the cash goes out the door. And as you know, we've sort of average, if you exclude JLT, we've sort of averaged about $1 billion a year on acquisitions, and that's likely to continue. Thank you, take care. Next question please. John, do you want to start with that? Thank you. I mean, you're basically right in that fiduciary income, we didn't have. A lot of it is -- drops to the bottom line. So a lot of it is profit, and that will help margins in the future. Please. So Mercer would have been more like a 7 instead of a 5, not 4. Okay. So it's a terrific business, Ryan. As we noted, the assets under delegated management are down about 20% year-over-year. But having said that, if you look over the decade -- over a decade, the CAGR on assets under delegated management is about a 20% number on a CAGR basis. So it's a great business. We're glad we're in it. But obviously, it's a headwind in the short term. Hopefully, in the short term. Thank you, and thank you for joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 86,000 colleagues for their commitment, hard work, and dedication to Marsh McLennan. And from the bottom of my heart, thank you for the trust you have put in me. Serving as CEO of Marsh McLennan has been an honor. Thank you."

            "content": "Yes, for sure. And thanks, Meyer, for the question. For us at Mercer in terms of environmental and social and governance, actually, we can work with clients on all three fronts; low-carbon economy, the transitions, sustainable investment. We help clients wherever they are in their philosophy of investment and their objectives to look at the market and the best risk and rewards [ph]. So our clients invest for the long run, and they look at the risk elements of their investment. And it's with that length that we're looking at the ESG factors with them. We don't see that kind of demand and necessity to look at risk. I mean, all through the Q&A today, we have talked about climate risk, for example. So we need to figure -- factor these risks in when we look at investment in all our clients get the returns that they're looking for. Other elements, of course, CE&I, social minimum standards of benefit across the world, so we pay equity. We have a lot of work there with our clients that are focused very much on building diverse workforces and the whole governance elements around it. Whether it goes from executive compensation, to the way that they manage and govern their investment. Actually coming back to investment, it's been quite a rough year on the capital market this new year. But we've been working with clients and actually, we've been very busy on the -- consulting side of the house, in particular, to help client navigate that very intense headwinds and volatility in capital markets. Yes. Thank you for the question, Robert. No, it's a good question. There's no doubt that coming out of the pandemic, the world of work has completely changed, and that has driven demand. But you look at all that's currently playing out, whether it's high inflation, it's labor shortage, it's emerging new skills that we have to help clients gravitate to reorganizing the way that you work. So we have talked before about the impact that recession has had in the past on the Career Services business. There's also the Career Product business, about half and half of revenue in that space. Career Product is actually more resilient through recessions. And Career Services, given the fundamentals that we see in the market today, we currently don't see any slowdown. Clients are really needing help to navigate all of the changes. We're not immune to a change in economic pace, but we rebound quickly, and we've -- we'll carry through. So, so far, so good. Yes. No, thanks, Ryan. It has an impact. We commented on it, and as you can imagine, it's our what we call our OCIO business where we are paid in this point of the assets under management. It has been a very good business to us. It's been growing rapidly, but it is exposed to short-term volatility from capital markets. And based on the market value that we see at the end of Q3, we do expect a drag from capital markets to continue in the fourth quarter, as a reference, and I think we alluded to that in our script. In Q3, this has cost us about two points of margin at Mercer, four points on Wealth. [Multiple Speakers]. Yes. And we had 15% in Career and 10% in health, rounding this up. And also, it does help us on the DB [ph] consulting side where we consult with client when there's such impact on the capital market. Our portfolio is diversified, so that helps. We had also a great net -- coming to our funds, which will [Technical Difficulty]."

Second quarter 2022 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter into our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earnings release.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nDan Glaser: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter was outstanding. Top line momentum continued to cross our business, extending our strongest run of quarterly underlying growth in over two decades. We generated robust top and bottom line results topping tough comparables in the prior year. Underlying growth of 10% in the quarter reflects considerable strength across our organization. It represents the fifth consecutive quarter of 10% or higher top line growth, building on 13% growth a year ago. Adjusted operating income of $1.3 billion was a second quarter record and grew 8% on top of 24% in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS growth of 8% is notable given our 33% growth in the second quarter of 2021, costs related to our strategic talent investments and the rebound of expenses such as T&E. We also completed the highest level of quarterly share repurchases in over a decade, buying back $600 million of stock. Overall, our second quarter performance reflects the strength of Marsh McLennan, the relevance of what we do and the expertise of our colleagues. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased with the momentum of our second quarter results, especially when viewed in the context of a macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop that has become increasingly tense over the course of the year. Entering 2022, the outlook was cautiously optimistic, reflecting expectations for above average GDP growth. Fast forward to today and we hear more about the rising risk of recession, the highest inflation in two generations, geopolitical tumult, central bank hawkishness and bear markets and risk assets. We have proven to be a resilient firm and we are prepared to act as conditions warrant. However, in the current environment, we believe it is worth noting some nuances to the macro story that remains supportive of our growth. While the real GDP growth outlook has softened, the outlook for inflation has risen. These two factors have somewhat offsetting impacts on insurance premiums. Even if GDP growth softens as predicted, higher inflation will increase insured values and likely cause higher loss costs. Additionally, P&C insurance pricing conditions remain firm, we are helping clients navigate an environment where underwriters remain cautious about where and how they deploy capital and terms and conditions are tight in some product lines. Insurers also continue to account for the rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, the risk of social inflation and firmer reinsurance market. Looking at the health benefits and workforce sectors, the U.S. labor market remains among the tightest employment environments of the past half century. Even if it has tempered at the margins, the U.S. unemployment rate is back to pre-pandemic lows and yet over 11 million jobs remain unfilled. And short-term interest rates are rising due to central bank tightening, which will be a benefit to fiduciary income. Importantly, we are in the business of risk, strategy and people when the world is unsettled demand for our services rises. We are helping our clients adapt to this rapidly changing landscape and navigate long-term challenges as well as opportunities. We are increasingly harnessing the collective power of our firm to guide clients as they deal with issues such as geopolitical risk, the pandemic, cyber threats, global supply chain disruptions, capital markets volatility, climate change, tight labor markets and new ways of working. Even if a recession does emerge, Marsh McLennan is well positioned to perform through the economic cycle. Since we went public in 1962, we have grown EPS during all recessionary periods. Most notably in the severe recessions that accompanied the global financial crisis and the pandemic in 2020. We have demonstrated our ability to manage the expense base in both good and tough times and run our business to grow revenues faster than expenses. We have reported adjusted operating margin improvement for 14 consecutive years. We also have a track record of delivering today, while investing for the future. This includes generating attractive financial performance, while at the same time investing in our talent and capabilities. Overall, I am proud of how we are executing and delivering for clients today and we continue to believe that over the long-term demand for our advice and solutions will remain strong, given rising levels of complexity, volatility and uncertainty across the business landscape. With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on the quarter.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Dan and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results were outstanding. We had 10% underlying revenue growth with momentum across the business and our adjusted operating income set a second quarter record. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m pleased with our performance and grateful to our colleagues for the value they deliver to our clients, communities and shareholders. Before I discuss market trends and our performance, I want to comment on the ways in which we are harnessing the collective strength of Marsh McLennan. We are finding the intersections where we bring unique capabilities to serve our clients. Earlier this year, I mentioned that I was meeting with our colleagues to identify areas where we can have greater client impact as well as accelerate our growth. These conversations have yielded a range of ideas to drive innovation, deliver critical client solutions, become more agile and efficient and growth and value for shareholders. Year to date, we have generated a significant number of wins involving two or more Marsh McLennan businesses and every day we see more potential to succeed together. Let me share a few recent examples. Marsh and Oliver Wyman helped a regional healthcare client with a broad enterprise risk management strategy. Knowing Marsh has this capability Oliver Wyman involved them in the engagement. The client was so pleased with the value of the team delivered that a further opportunity was created for Mercer to consult on workforce issues. Marsh and Mercer engaged a higher education client in the United States about enterprise risk management. The client valued our expertise and ability to facilitate conversations about total risk across all lines of insurance. As a result, Marsh was awarded the property and casualty insurance program and Mercer secured the student health, travel and athletics business. The client has since engaged the joint team about expanding additional lines of coverage. Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman also came together recently to help a large U.S. insurer with strategic advice to reposition a core product. The successful collaboration is expected to lead to additional business and further opportunities to partner on future projects. These are just a few examples of the ways we are helping clients grow faster and become more resilient. Now let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Rate increases in the marketplace persist along with continued concerns around the impact of inflation on loss cost and a tightening reinsurance market. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 9% year-over-year. This marks the 19th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. Looking at pricing by line, the Marsh Market Index showed both global property insurance and global casualty rates up 6% on average. Global financial and professional lines, excluding cyber increased low single digits, while cyber rates rose nearly 80% in some geographies. As a reminder, our index skews the large account business. However, small and middle market insurance rates continue to rise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. Turning to reinsurance. Guy Carpenter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s U.S. Property Catastrophe Rate on Line Index showed increases of approximately 15% through midyear, the largest increase since 2006. Midyear renewals reflected one of the most challenging property markets in many years with pricing driven by inflation, escalating geopolitical risk and loss experience. Throughout the first half of the year, we saw some reinsurers take tougher positions on specific terms and conditions and shift portfolios to limit capacity in certain lines of business or geographies. We remain focused on helping our clients navigate these challenging insurance and reinsurance markets and the heightened risk environment. Turning to our performance in the quarter. As I noted earlier, Marsh McLennan had excellent results. In the second quarter, we had 10% underlying revenue growth with 9% in RIS and 10% in consulting. This is a fantastic result considering the prior year second quarter underlying growth was 13%. Bottom line results were strong as well with adjusted operating income growth of 8% in the quarter compared to 24% growth a year ago. Looking at risk and insurance services. Second quarter revenue was a record $3.3 billion, up 5% compared with a year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to a second quarter record of $1 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 32.8%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion, up 5% compared with a year ago. Revenue growth was 9% on an underlying basis and supported by strong renewal growth and new business. U.S. and Canada had 10% underlying revenue growth. This marks U.S. and Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth consecutive quarter of double digit underlying revenue growth. International was also strong with underlying growth of 9%. Latin America grew 14%, Asia Pacific was up 11% and EMEA was up 7%. Guy Carpenter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second quarter revenue was $522 million up 9% on an underlying basis driven by strong retention in new business as well as rate increases, which continued at midyear. Guy Carpenter has now achieved underlying revenue growth of 9% or higher in four of the last five quarters. In the Consulting segment revenue was $2.1 billion and up 10% from a year ago on both a reported and underlying basis. This is Consulting\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fifth consecutive quarter of double digit underlying revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 4% to a second quarter high of $369 million. The adjusted operating margin was 19.3% down 20 basis points versus a year ago. Mercer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter up 7% on an underlying basis. Career grew 17% on an underlying basis, a record since we began reporting this line of business. We continue to see robust demand for solutions linked to workforce transformation and compensation and rewards. Health underlying revenue growth was also excellent at 10% in the quarter, reflecting growth across all geographies. This quarter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s results continue to benefit from strong demand for our solutions, accelerating new business, higher retention, increased enrolled lives from a strong labor market and medical inflation. Wealth increased wealth increase 1% on an underlying basis. Reflecting modest growth and defined benefits, which offset a modest decline in investments. Our assets under management were $346 billion at the end of the second quarter down 12% from the prior year reflecting capital market and foreign exchange headwinds. In May, Mercer announced an agreement with Westpac to acquire BT Super Trust and advanced Asset Management Australia. This will create a $45 billion Mercer fund helping more than 850,000 Australians invest for retirement. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. Oliver Wyman strong momentum continued. Revenue in the second quarter was $695 million, an increase of 16% on an underlying basis. This follows a 28% comparable in the second quarter of 2021 and reflects continued spend across all geographies. Overall, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m proud of our second quarter performance, which demonstrates the continued momentum across our business, despite a more uncertain macro environment. Now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2022.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John and good morning. As Dan and John mentioned our strong financial performance in the second quarter reflects continued momentum across our business. We saw another quarter of double underlying revenue growth and meaningful earnings growth despite tough prior year revenue and expense comparisons. We generated GAAP EPS of $1.91 in the quarter and adjusted EPS of $1.89 up 8% from a year ago. This comes on top of adjusted EPS growth of 33% in the second quarter of last year. Operating income was $1.4 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion. Our adjusted operating margin was 26.7% in the second quarter up 30 basis points year-over-year. John covered our business operating results. So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover some of the other aspects of our performance and outlook. Adjusted corporate expense was $62 million in the second quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately $142 million for the second half of the year. Foreign exchange was a headwind of $0.03 to our adjusted due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies. Year-to-date foreign exchange represents $0.07 headwind. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels. We expect FX to be a headwind of $0.01 in the third quarter and $0.05 in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $59 million in the quarter. For the full year 2022, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $2 million in the second quarter on a GAAP basis and $3 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains in our private equity portfolio. Interest expense in the second quarter was $114 million compared to $110 million in the second quarter of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense to be about $118 million in each of the third and fourth quarters. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 23.7% compared with 24.4% in the second quarter of last year. The lower rate this quarter was driven by a decline in our underlying tax rate to 25% from 25.5% a year ago. Our tax rate in the quarter also included a benefit from favorable discrete items, the largest of which related to stock compensation. When we give forward guidance tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume an adjusted effective tax rate of around 25% for 2022. Turning to capital management, our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $11.8 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is March of 2023, when $350 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2022 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, the ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how our M&A pipeline develops. Last week, we raised our quarterly dividend 10% marking our 13th consecutive year of dividend increases. In the second quarter, we bought back 3.8 million shares of our stock for $600 million reflecting our strong financial position and outlook for cash generation. Our acquisition pipeline remains active. As John mentioned, we recently announced Mercer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agreement with Westpac to combine the BT and Mercer Super Trust in Australia. We are also looking forward to Mercer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acquisition of Advanced Asset Management from Westpac. We are excited about these deals and how they extend Mercer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading position in OCIO. Our cash position at the end of this quarter was $909 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.1 billion and included $275 million for dividends, $232 million for acquisitions and $600 million for share repurchases. For the first six months uses of cash totaled $1.9 billion and included $547 million for dividends, $273 million for acquisitions and $1.1 billion for share repurchases. Regarding the outlook for the rest of 2022, we remain on track for a terrific year. Our top line comps get tougher in the second half, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s greater uncertainty in the macro outlook. However, with our strong first half, we see underlying growth at the upper end of our full-year guidance of mid single digits or higher. We also continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and solid growth in adjusted EPS. With that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to turn it back to Dan.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Mark. Richard, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator:  And our first question online comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, I was hoping to just get some color on the impact of the new hires this quarter. I think last quarter you see an impact in Guy Carpenter. Did that continue and did Marsh also see a benefit in the second quarter?\nDan Glaser: Yeah, I mean as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said before, Elyse and good morning to you as well. At Marsh McLennan, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re largely focused on building our capabilities and building our talent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about the talent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not necessarily all about, well, what kind of book of business or what kind of production does that individual drive and how quickly can they get to know with our distribution, our client base, the prospects that we go after in the complexity of the world, that there will be plenty of opportunities to get our talent engaged. Now having said that, yes, last year we had a strategy to build our talent base for a variety of different reasons, we arrived at that strategy. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit more acute in terms of how does it translate to revenue and obviously it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue from us right now across the firm. But John, you want to give a little bit more detail about what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing from the new hires?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Dan. Yeah, at least we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very pleased with the hiring we did last year. As you know, we capitalized on our brand as \u00e2\u0080\u0093 our strong brand as an employer in the marketplace and some market dislocation. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worked out exceedingly well for us. Our focus this year has been onboarding that talent and a success and bringing them to a level of productivity. As we noted last quarter, Guy Carpenter, the impact on Guy Carpenter was a bit earlier as expected than it will be at Marsh, but the talent we brought in has been very, very helpful at Marsh as well. We serve our clients in teams. And I think one of the things that feels particularly good about is just the cultural fit of these new colleagues, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worked out very, very well. So we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re on target from productivity. We slightly ahead and we feel terrific about the investments we made.\nDan Glaser: And I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really important, John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment about that we serve clients in teams. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we do. So there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a number on an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s back of what they have to produce in a given timeframe. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve built the capabilities of the firm, and that is a lasting basis of increasing value that we provide to clients. Do you have a follow-up?\nElyse Greenspan: Yeah, thanks. My follow-up, so Dan you kicked off the call discussing the potential impact of a recession. You also highlighted that inflation could be a benefit as well as the still good commercial pricing. So if we do enter into a recession, whether that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s later this year or in 2023, is that an environment when you think about those moving pieces that Marsh McLennan can still continue to hit that mid single digit organic growth target?\nDan Glaser: Yeah. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to give you guidance about our revenue next year or later. I mean, I do think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that in all past recessions, since 1962, we grew adjusted EPS and we know how to run a business in good times and in bad times. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve proven to be a very resilient firm. Now, there is certainly uncertainty about the economic outlook and big deal to be concerned about on a macro basis and a geopolitical basis in the world today. I mean, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s to be sure. But as I noted in the script, there are other factors which tend to support our growth. And whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strong demand for our services in difficult times, whether its inflation, as you mentioned, higher interest rates, which are direct benefit to fiduciary income and profitability, and the insurance market is firm, its firm and if anything, reinsurance on the property side is even tightening. So we feel good about where we are positioned now. As we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in past recessions, you could see the most discretionary parts of our business are Oliver Wyman and Mercer Career. You take them together, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about 16% or 17% of the total firm, and they tend to be impacted the quickest in downturn. However right now their performance has been remarkably strong in both Oliver Wyman and Mercer Career, and their pipelines remain strong. So the red flag is not going up quite yet, but we watch it carefully.\nJohn Doyle: You know, Dan, maybe one more thing to throw in, at least you talked about inflation and pricing in the commercial P&C market, a better asked about that, but our revenue line is also exposed to medical inflation. I noted that in my prepared remarks, but medical inflation also is a tailwind for us.\nDan Glaser: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good point. Next question, please.\nOperator:  Our next one comes from Mr. Robert Cox from Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So yeah, my first one, I just wanted to ask about the environment and noting that, some notable companies have come out and said things like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re being more cautious in with respect to hiring and maybe slowing spend on professional fees. So, I mean, you just touched on it a little bit, but are you seeing any of that in the impact on your runway for project related work? I guess, particularly with respect to Oliver Wyman?\nDan Glaser: No, I mean, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hand off to Nick in a second, but Oliver Wyman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance has been very strong. Pipelines still look good. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a lot of looks across different areas. Everything from efficiency plays to growth plays. And so Nick, you want to give us a little bit more.\nNick Studer: Yeah. Dan, I mean, I think you summarized it well, Robert, thanks for the question. We are delighted with the continued progress really across all four of our regions we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been in double digit growth and the pipeline looks robust in all four of them. We have 12 different industry practices. The majority of those have been in double digit growth led by energy, by healthcare and life sciences, by retail banking, automotive and manufacturing and private capital. And Dan gave the nod to the broad range of capabilities that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing working again, led by some of our organizational effectiveness and operational efficiency work, but also restructuring, also finance and risk. There is quite a few countercyclical offerings in there. So we do think over time that sort of mid to high single digit growth will be all through the cycle average. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s obviously been faster recently. But the pipeline still looks good as Dan mentioned.\nDan Glaser: And Robert, one thing that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just mention, in your question around hiring or the caution around hiring within our client base, I mean as you can see, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a very tight labor market, particularly in the United States. Companies are very focused on how to attract and retain colleagues and they engage Mercer regularly in that. And in respect to Marsh McLennan, specifically, our hiring last year where we had 6,000 net hiring, the timing of that in retrospect is really pretty perfect entering the environment that we are in today. And we have gone back to our more normal pattern of hiring. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not caution, I would say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a recognition that we had a large degree of hiring last year and our hiring pace this year is very consistent with our hiring that we did in say 2017, 2018, 2019 if you look at those in the aggregate year-by-year on CAGR basis. And so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of back to normal on the hiring front, do you have a follow up Robert?\nRobert Cox: Hey, yeah. So just with the, with respect to those comments, as you think about a potential recession, those hires that you made in 2021, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s certainly some tailwinds for the brokerage business right now, is that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 are those tailwinds enough to kind have that talent base hold their own in a recessionary environment? Or would you look at that and say this is going to be a margin headwind?\nDan Glaser: No, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve grown our margins in good times and in bad times. And certainly this is our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 this will be our 15th year of margin expansion because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamentally philosophically the way we run the business. We grow revenues at a faster pace than we grow expenses. And so our margins will go up on that basis. Now, our underlying levels of growth have a big impact, the higher the levels of growth, that we see next year, the year after the more we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to think about margins, the tighter levels of growth would make those things more difficult. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a company that can perform in good times and in bad times. And so things like recessions, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a natural form of the economic cycle in a capitalist society. So we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fret over that and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t plan all that much around it. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll run our business and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll deliver fine results and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll continue to invest as we go. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. So first, I just had a question following up on your comments on the pricing environment. Are you seeing any changes on the parts of your clients in response to higher pricing, both in the primary side and also in reinsurance?\nDan Glaser: So John, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you take that one?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Jimmy, just a little bit of background and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ask Martin and Dean to talk about some of the marketplace, some observations they have around the current marketplace. So, as I said earlier, prices reining up in both insurance and re-insurance. Insurers and reinsurers remain concerned about elevated cat losses over the last several years, including secondary perils. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re spending a lot of time better modeling and understanding secondary perils. Inflation, both core inflation but their concerns about social inflation as well. And then the frequency of large losses, insurers led the turn in the market several years ago. Now reinsurers are pressing on pricing and terms and conditions. So the things have changed a bit, but as I mentioned, retail pricing, insurance pricing remains up. Martin, maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ask you to share some observations first, and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ask Dean to talk about what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on in the reinsurance market.\nMartin South: Thank you, John. Well, the risk of repeating things just to get some numbers squared away, pricing is strong in second quarter, which is very challenging for our clients is as the question noted. Rates continue to moderate though, in the course, which is good news for our clients, FINPRO rates are up 16%, which is really driven by cyber core FINPRO. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually flattish and cyber is driving growth there, property up 6%, casualty up 6%, which is just upper take over the prior quarter. And so those are the real drivers for it. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficult to see any inflationary impacts in the rates, although it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that we got a declining rate increase which would have been faster in a normal inflationary environment. And of course, our clients have some options. We manage some captives and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re able to retain more risk in their captive to deal with those issues.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks. Good. Thank you, Martin. And Dean, as I noted in my prepared remarks, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some segments of the reinsurance market are capacity constraints, maybe you can touch on that as you share some observations with Jimmy.\nDean Klisura: Yes. Thanks, John. Jimmy, I would say in terms of the reinsurance renewal, the first half as John noted was the most challenging property market we have seen in a number of years. John noted U.S. property cat rates increasing 15% on average through the first half of the year. The largest increase we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen since 2006, the June one mid-year renewal was particularly challenging as we saw property cat capacity really constrained globally with particular challenge in the U.S. and London wholesale market. John and Dan, both noted many of the macro influences impacting the reinsurance market on the property side, including rising inflation, uncertainty from the Russia-Ukraine war, climate change anxiety on behalf of our clients and reinsurers, the continued increase in global cat losses and certainly reduced retrocession protections on behalf of our reinsurers. That being said to your question, demand for our advice and solutions remains very strong as our clients try to manage volatility on their balance sheets and our clients are seeking strategic advice on systemic risk. And John mentioned climate, cyber, ESG, and the emergence of secondary perils. Every day, we read about wildfires, convective storms, floods throughout the world. Our clients are asking us to build tools to help and manage through that volatility and understand how they manage their businesses moving forward.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Dean.\nJimmy Bhullar: And just as a follow up, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a lot of concern in the market about Oliver Wyman and the consulting business with an economic flow down. Obviously you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not showing that in your results. But what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving the momentum there and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your outlook for the business as the economy does in fact slow down a little bit?\nDan Glaser: Yes. And so, we talked to you over many years about how Oliver Wyman over long stretches of time tends to be our fastest growing segment. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been dramatically pleased. I mean, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing that I could say negatively right now about Oliver Wyman posting a 16 on top of a 28 in the year before on the top line. But Nick, how do you see things?\nNick Studer: Yes, I mean, I think sort of broad growth and robust pipeline. We are prepared in terms of our client offerings. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that when the cycle changes and the questions change, we are prepared with answers for those new questions. And so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been preparing those offerings for quite a few years now. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d also say that the pandemic created very different market conditions in each of the sectors we serve. So some of our client segments have been having a very tough time for quite a long time and others have been booming. But overall, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve see no slow down in the pipeline to-date.\nDan Glaser: Sure. And Martine, you want to talk about what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in Mercer generally and Mercer career specifically?\nMartine Ferland: Yes, absolutely. Thank you, Dan and Jimmy, for the question. In a very similar fashion, we see pipeline being strong in the career business, career services in particular. And as Nick just mentioned, the pandemic had instigated and accelerated so much change around the way that we work. We see the labor shortages. So we currently don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any slowdown or any evidence of it. We certainly are cautious in looking at the red flags where \u00e2\u0080\u0093 when and where they will pop up, but there is these conditions in the market right now, different questions as Nick was saying that our expertise can help clients answer.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question on line comes from Mr. David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Dan, you mentioned you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re prepared to act as economic conditions warrant. Could you maybe just elaborate a bit on some of these actions and how far away you are from putting some of those in place? What sort of you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for in the environment before you start to take some of these actions?\nDan Glaser: Yes, I mean, ultimately, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s several things that we are working on, I would say in over both throughout short-term, midterm and long-term as a way to become a more efficient organization and that touches upon technology modernization, real estate rationalization, different ways of working for our colleagues. Looking at a number of factors on operational excellence, I mean, I think in general, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still in the early to mid stages of being able to create operational improvements within the firm, which deliver higher levels of client service at lower levels of internal cost. And that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly very focused on. One of the things that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking at as well is you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to get too cautious, too early. Our business is doing significantly well. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been investing throughout both through the pandemic in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 as well as in 2021. And we continue to invest today. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still in a hiring mode. Although, the hiring pace is more similar to 2019 than it would have been in 2021, where we had a real surge in strategic hiring, most of our costs are pretty identifiable. You have compensation and benefits. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got technology, you have premises or real estate, and you have T&E. So the levers that you can utilize are available. And I have to say, we have a very large variable compensation pool driven by profitability. And so, it is dramatically larger than it was a decade ago or five years ago because our profitability is dramatically larger. And that gives us tremendous flexibility of protecting shareholders in the event that that we hit some headwinds on growth or macroeconomic factors. So you never want to be tangling about macroenvironment and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not. But on the other hand, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a more resilient organization that you could actually invest in.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. No that...\nDan Glaser: Do you have any follow-up?\nDavid Motemaden: That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then I guess just \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I guess sort of an expense related question, but more focused on the margins. So, the first half was supposed to be tougher comps, I think we just got out of the first half pretty good expansion, 20 basis points of expansion in the first half of 2022. Should we expect a tick up in that as we sort of get into the back half because some of these tougher comps are no longer as tough from an expense standpoint? Or were there any \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was there anything sort of one-off in the expense flow this quarter or in the first quarter that might mean that there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little bit shifted to the back half of the year?\nDan Glaser: Yes. I mean, to be clear, we are super pleased with our modest margin expansion year to date. I mean, come on, we hired 6,000 people on a net basis last year and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to grow our business and deliver some modest margin expansion. And all the growth benefit or I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say all, most of the growth benefit is in our future as opposed to in our past. So, if we look at the back half of the third quarter, the headwind on comp have been expensed from all of the hiring begins to abate. And so, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and the growth benefit will continue. And so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give margin guidance by quarter. But we give it by year and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying our margins are going to go up this year. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to have strong EPS in 2022. And so we feel good about where we are on margins. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t run the business obsessing about margins, frankly, we run the business looking at growing our top line and growing our profitability and margins are an outcome of growing our revenue faster than growing our expense. But our \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the back half of the year will play out and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll deliver a strong year. We think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be a very good year. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question online comes from Weston Bloomer from UBS.\nWeston Bloomer: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first one is on your free cash flow growth. Growth is okay in the 2Q, but one half has been a little bit lower, looks like mostly to higher crude comp. My question is how should we think about free cash flow growth in the second half of the year? And are there any notable headwinds or tailwinds to point out?\nDan Glaser: Sure. Mark, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you take that?\nMark McGivney: Sure. As we consistently say, we try not to focus too much on free cash flow growth in a particular quarter, even over the course of a particular year, because it can be a lot of volatility. But when we look back over a long stretch of time going back a decade or more, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve delivered double digit growth in free cash flow and our outlook for free cash flow growth is that will continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth. You pointed out the comparison challenge. The early part of the year is our seasonal low for cash generation because of our variable comp payouts. And the first half of this year has a tough comparable. Our variable comp pools were up substantially last year based on our significant good performance. And so you have that tough comp against the low base and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the drag early in the year. As you pointed out and not that I want to focus on cash flow in a particular quarter, but in the second quarter we were up 8%. But I think the bottom line is our outlook for cash generation remains strong.\nDan Glaser: Thanks. Do you have a follow up?\nWeston Bloomer: I do. Yes. My second question is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on your capital allocation throughout the year. I guess, how much of the second quarter allocation for higher repurchases was maybe due to a lower share price or less opportunities or richer multiples in M&A? I was hoping you could kind of expand on the M&A environment where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing from multiple perspective and where you could see opportunities? And kind of how we should think about repurchases versus M&A in the second half? Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Sure. Well, clearly multiples have gone up over the last few years. And certainly when you look at longer stretches of time, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone up materially. And so we have to be more diligent in deciding as we go through pro forma statements of private companies, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really real and what will remain and how we think about the business. Our pipeline is pretty good. When we \u00e2\u0080\u0093 what we announce with regard to Westpac in Australia though, has cash out the door next year, not this year, even though that is a commitment that that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made in terms of acquiring a business. So our pipeline remains strong, but we have no budget with regard to acquisitions. Acquisitions are a core part of our competency and what we do as a firm. And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very right to focus on share repurchase as being a somehow a dual \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a duo with acquisitions. If we have a year that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particularly light on acquisitions, then we would have a stronger year of share repurchase. We favor share repurchases over building cash on the balance sheet. So you look at our dividend, which went up by 10%, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the first call. Then we look at acquisitions, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a budget on acquisition, and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t press on acquisitions. They occur when they occur. Then share repurchase goes in front of building cash on the balance sheet. And so, yes, so far, first half of this year has favored share repurchase. Doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean the second half will. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll just have to see how it plays out.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDan Glaser: Next question please. Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Katie Sakys from Autonomous Research.\nKatie Sakys: Hi there. Thank you so much for taking my question. This is Katie on for Ryan Tunis at Autonomous. I had a question about your guidance on foreign currency headwinds, which seems rather moderate despite foreign currency moves. Could you give us some further color on your confidence in the modest EPS impact you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve guided to particularly in the third quarter? Is it a matter of the timing of the recognition of international revenue or mix or perhaps just Marsh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recognition of international revenues in USC versus local currencies?\nDan Glaser: Thanks, Katie. Mark, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you take that?\nMark McGivney: Yes, sure. And when you look at our guidance over the course of the full year, so $0.07 in the first half, and then $0.06 across the back half, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pretty meaningful impact when you look back over the last several. And actually tracks pretty well with our 10-K disclosure of 10% move in the dollar against major currencies what that means. For the third quarter though, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about this in the past, there is a modest impact and that is what we are modelling, assuming that rates stay where they are today. Really what you see in the third quarter is because of dollar placement activity in London a weak pound actually act as a bit of a hedge against a strong dollar relative to the other currencies. And that pound impact that natural hedge impact, if you will is most significant in this coming third quarter. And so what you see is a benefit from the weak pound offsetting some of the other currencies. But as we get to the fourth quarter, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s when that benefit as strong and then we see that $0.05 in the fourth quarter.\nKatie Sakys: Got it. Thank you. And as a quick follow up, are you expecting any margin tailwinds from foreign currency in the back half of the year?\nDan Glaser: Mark, do you want to talk about that at all?\nMark McGivney: Yes. Generally not significantly, most of our margin is going to be driven by our operating performance.\nDan Glaser: Thanks.\nOperator: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan for any closing remarks.\nDan Glaser: Terrific. And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 83 colleagues for their commitment, hard work and dedication to Marsh McLennan. Look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conference. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "Dan Glaser",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennana\u0302\u0080\u0099s second quarter was outstanding. Top line momentum continued to cross our business, extending our strongest run of quarterly underlying growth in over two decades. We generated robust top and bottom line results topping tough comparables in the prior year. Underlying growth of 10% in the quarter reflects considerable strength across our organization. It represents the fifth consecutive quarter of 10% or higher top line growth, building on 13% growth a year ago. Adjusted operating income of $1.3 billion was a second quarter record and grew 8% on top of 24% in the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS growth of 8% is notable given our 33% growth in the second quarter of 2021, costs related to our strategic talent investments and the rebound of expenses such as T&E. We also completed the highest level of quarterly share repurchases in over a decade, buying back $600 million of stock. Overall, our second quarter performance reflects the strength of Marsh McLennan, the relevance of what we do and the expertise of our colleagues. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m pleased with the momentum of our second quarter results, especially when viewed in the context of a macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop that has become increasingly tense over the course of the year. Entering 2022, the outlook was cautiously optimistic, reflecting expectations for above average GDP growth. Fast forward to today and we hear more about the rising risk of recession, the highest inflation in two generations, geopolitical tumult, central bank hawkishness and bear markets and risk assets. We have proven to be a resilient firm and we are prepared to act as conditions warrant. However, in the current environment, we believe it is worth noting some nuances to the macro story that remains supportive of our growth. While the real GDP growth outlook has softened, the outlook for inflation has risen. These two factors have somewhat offsetting impacts on insurance premiums. Even if GDP growth softens as predicted, higher inflation will increase insured values and likely cause higher loss costs. Additionally, P&C insurance pricing conditions remain firm, we are helping clients navigate an environment where underwriters remain cautious about where and how they deploy capital and terms and conditions are tight in some product lines. Insurers also continue to account for the rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, the risk of social inflation and firmer reinsurance market. Looking at the health benefits and workforce sectors, the U.S. labor market remains among the tightest employment environments of the past half century. Even if it has tempered at the margins, the U.S. unemployment rate is back to pre-pandemic lows and yet over 11 million jobs remain unfilled. And short-term interest rates are rising due to central bank tightening, which will be a benefit to fiduciary income. Importantly, we are in the business of risk, strategy and people when the world is unsettled demand for our services rises. We are helping our clients adapt to this rapidly changing landscape and navigate long-term challenges as well as opportunities. We are increasingly harnessing the collective power of our firm to guide clients as they deal with issues such as geopolitical risk, the pandemic, cyber threats, global supply chain disruptions, capital markets volatility, climate change, tight labor markets and new ways of working. Even if a recession does emerge, Marsh McLennan is well positioned to perform through the economic cycle. Since we went public in 1962, we have grown EPS during all recessionary periods. Most notably in the severe recessions that accompanied the global financial crisis and the pandemic in 2020. We have demonstrated our ability to manage the expense base in both good and tough times and run our business to grow revenues faster than expenses. We have reported adjusted operating margin improvement for 14 consecutive years. We also have a track record of delivering today, while investing for the future. This includes generating attractive financial performance, while at the same time investing in our talent and capabilities. Overall, I am proud of how we are executing and delivering for clients today and we continue to believe that over the long-term demand for our advice and solutions will remain strong, given rising levels of complexity, volatility and uncertainty across the business landscape. With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on the quarter. Thanks Mark. Richard, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re ready to begin Q&A. Yeah, I mean as Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ve said before, Elyse and good morning to you as well. At Marsh McLennan, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re largely focused on building our capabilities and building our talent. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s all about the talent. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s not necessarily all about, well, what kind of book of business or what kind of production does that individual drive and how quickly can they get to know with our distribution, our client base, the prospects that we go after in the complexity of the world, that there will be plenty of opportunities to get our talent engaged. Now having said that, yes, last year we had a strategy to build our talent base for a variety of different reasons, we arrived at that strategy. So ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s a little bit more acute in terms of how does it translate to revenue and obviously ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s revenue from us right now across the firm. But John, you want to give a little bit more detail about what youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing from the new hires? And I think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s really important, Johna\u0302\u0080\u0099s comment about that we serve clients in teams. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s what we do. So therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s not a number on an individuala\u0302\u0080\u0099s back of what they have to produce in a given timeframe. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve built the capabilities of the firm, and that is a lasting basis of increasing value that we provide to clients. Do you have a follow-up? Yeah. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m not going to give you guidance about our revenue next year or later. I mean, I do think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s important to note that in all past recessions, since 1962, we grew adjusted EPS and we know how to run a business in good times and in bad times. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve proven to be a very resilient firm. Now, there is certainly uncertainty about the economic outlook and big deal to be concerned about on a macro basis and a geopolitical basis in the world today. I mean, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s to be sure. But as I noted in the script, there are other factors which tend to support our growth. And whether ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s strong demand for our services in difficult times, whether its inflation, as you mentioned, higher interest rates, which are direct benefit to fiduciary income and profitability, and the insurance market is firm, its firm and if anything, reinsurance on the property side is even tightening. So we feel good about where we are positioned now. As wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve seen in past recessions, you could see the most discretionary parts of our business are Oliver Wyman and Mercer Career. You take them together, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s about 16% or 17% of the total firm, and they tend to be impacted the quickest in downturn. However right now their performance has been remarkably strong in both Oliver Wyman and Mercer Career, and their pipelines remain strong. So the red flag is not going up quite yet, but we watch it carefully. Thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s a good point. Next question, please. No, I mean, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll hand off to Nick in a second, but Oliver Wymana\u0302\u0080\u0099s performance has been very strong. Pipelines still look good. Theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re getting a lot of looks across different areas. Everything from efficiency plays to growth plays. And so Nick, you want to give us a little bit more. And Robert, one thing that Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll just mention, in your question around hiring or the caution around hiring within our client base, I mean as you can see, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s been a very tight labor market, particularly in the United States. Companies are very focused on how to attract and retain colleagues and they engage Mercer regularly in that. And in respect to Marsh McLennan, specifically, our hiring last year where we had 6,000 net hiring, the timing of that in retrospect is really pretty perfect entering the environment that we are in today. And we have gone back to our more normal pattern of hiring. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s not caution, I would say ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s just a recognition that we had a large degree of hiring last year and our hiring pace this year is very consistent with our hiring that we did in say 2017, 2018, 2019 if you look at those in the aggregate year-by-year on CAGR basis. And so ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s kind of back to normal on the hiring front, do you have a follow up Robert? No, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve grown our margins in good times and in bad times. And certainly this is our a\u0302\u0080\u0093 this will be our 15th year of margin expansion because ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s fundamentally philosophically the way we run the business. We grow revenues at a faster pace than we grow expenses. And so our margins will go up on that basis. Now, our underlying levels of growth have a big impact, the higher the levels of growth, that we see next year, the year after the more wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll be able to think about margins, the tighter levels of growth would make those things more difficult. But wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re a company that can perform in good times and in bad times. And so things like recessions, theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re a natural form of the economic cycle in a capitalist society. So we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t fret over that and we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t plan all that much around it. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll run our business and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll deliver fine results and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll continue to invest as we go. Next question, please. So John, why dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t you take that one? Yes. And so, we talked to you over many years about how Oliver Wyman over long stretches of time tends to be our fastest growing segment. And wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been dramatically pleased. I mean, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s nothing that I could say negatively right now about Oliver Wyman posting a 16 on top of a 28 in the year before on the top line. But Nick, how do you see things? Sure. And Martine, you want to talk about what youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing in Mercer generally and Mercer career specifically? Next question, please. Yes, I mean, ultimately, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s several things that we are working on, I would say in over both throughout short-term, midterm and long-term as a way to become a more efficient organization and that touches upon technology modernization, real estate rationalization, different ways of working for our colleagues. Looking at a number of factors on operational excellence, I mean, I think in general, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re still in the early to mid stages of being able to create operational improvements within the firm, which deliver higher levels of client service at lower levels of internal cost. And thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s something that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re certainly very focused on. One of the things that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re looking at as well is you dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t want to get too cautious, too early. Our business is doing significantly well. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been investing throughout both through the pandemic in a\u0302\u0080\u0093 as well as in 2021. And we continue to invest today. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re still in a hiring mode. Although, the hiring pace is more similar to 2019 than it would have been in 2021, where we had a real surge in strategic hiring, most of our costs are pretty identifiable. You have compensation and benefits. Youa\u0302\u0080\u0099ve got technology, you have premises or real estate, and you have T&E. So the levers that you can utilize are available. And I have to say, we have a very large variable compensation pool driven by profitability. And so, it is dramatically larger than it was a decade ago or five years ago because our profitability is dramatically larger. And that gives us tremendous flexibility of protecting shareholders in the event that that we hit some headwinds on growth or macroeconomic factors. So you never want to be tangling about macroenvironment and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re not. But on the other hand, I dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t think therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s a more resilient organization that you could actually invest in. Do you have any follow-up? Yes. I mean, to be clear, we are super pleased with our modest margin expansion year to date. I mean, come on, we hired 6,000 people on a net basis last year and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been able to grow our business and deliver some modest margin expansion. And all the growth benefit or I shouldna\u0302\u0080\u0099t say all, most of the growth benefit is in our future as opposed to in our past. So, if we look at the back half of the third quarter, the headwind on comp have been expensed from all of the hiring begins to abate. And so, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll be a\u0302\u0080\u0093 and the growth benefit will continue. And so we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t give margin guidance by quarter. But we give it by year and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re saying our margins are going to go up this year. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re going to have strong EPS in 2022. And so we feel good about where we are on margins. We dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t run the business obsessing about margins, frankly, we run the business looking at growing our top line and growing our profitability and margins are an outcome of growing our revenue faster than growing our expense. But our a\u0302\u0080\u0093 the back half of the year will play out and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll deliver a strong year. We think ita\u0302\u0080\u0099ll be a very good year. Next question, please. Sure. Mark, why dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t you take that? Thanks. Do you have a follow up? Sure. Well, clearly multiples have gone up over the last few years. And certainly when you look at longer stretches of time, theya\u0302\u0080\u0099ve gone up materially. And so we have to be more diligent in deciding as we go through pro forma statements of private companies, whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s really real and what will remain and how we think about the business. Our pipeline is pretty good. When we a\u0302\u0080\u0093 what we announce with regard to Westpac in Australia though, has cash out the door next year, not this year, even though that is a commitment that that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve made in terms of acquiring a business. So our pipeline remains strong, but we have no budget with regard to acquisitions. Acquisitions are a core part of our competency and what we do as a firm. And youa\u0302\u0080\u0099re very right to focus on share repurchase as being a somehow a dual a\u0302\u0080\u0093 a duo with acquisitions. If we have a year thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s particularly light on acquisitions, then we would have a stronger year of share repurchase. We favor share repurchases over building cash on the balance sheet. So you look at our dividend, which went up by 10%, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s the first call. Then we look at acquisitions, but we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t have a budget on acquisition, and we dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t press on acquisitions. They occur when they occur. Then share repurchase goes in front of building cash on the balance sheet. And so, yes, so far, first half of this year has favored share repurchase. Doesna\u0302\u0080\u0099t mean the second half will. Wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll just have to see how it plays out. Next question please. Sure. Thanks, Katie. Mark, why dona\u0302\u0080\u0099t you take that? Mark, do you want to talk about that at all? Thanks. Terrific. And Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d like to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. I want to thank our 83 colleagues for their commitment, hard work and dedication to Marsh McLennan. Look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Goodbye."

            "name": "John Doyle",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan and good morning everyone. Our second quarter results were outstanding. We had 10% underlying revenue growth with momentum across the business and our adjusted operating income set a second quarter record. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m pleased with our performance and grateful to our colleagues for the value they deliver to our clients, communities and shareholders. Before I discuss market trends and our performance, I want to comment on the ways in which we are harnessing the collective strength of Marsh McLennan. We are finding the intersections where we bring unique capabilities to serve our clients. Earlier this year, I mentioned that I was meeting with our colleagues to identify areas where we can have greater client impact as well as accelerate our growth. These conversations have yielded a range of ideas to drive innovation, deliver critical client solutions, become more agile and efficient and growth and value for shareholders. Year to date, we have generated a significant number of wins involving two or more Marsh McLennan businesses and every day we see more potential to succeed together. Let me share a few recent examples. Marsh and Oliver Wyman helped a regional healthcare client with a broad enterprise risk management strategy. Knowing Marsh has this capability Oliver Wyman involved them in the engagement. The client was so pleased with the value of the team delivered that a further opportunity was created for Mercer to consult on workforce issues. Marsh and Mercer engaged a higher education client in the United States about enterprise risk management. The client valued our expertise and ability to facilitate conversations about total risk across all lines of insurance. As a result, Marsh was awarded the property and casualty insurance program and Mercer secured the student health, travel and athletics business. The client has since engaged the joint team about expanding additional lines of coverage. Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman also came together recently to help a large U.S. insurer with strategic advice to reposition a core product. The successful collaboration is expected to lead to additional business and further opportunities to partner on future projects. These are just a few examples of the ways we are helping clients grow faster and become more resilient. Now let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Rate increases in the marketplace persist along with continued concerns around the impact of inflation on loss cost and a tightening reinsurance market. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 9% year-over-year. This marks the 19th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. Looking at pricing by line, the Marsh Market Index showed both global property insurance and global casualty rates up 6% on average. Global financial and professional lines, excluding cyber increased low single digits, while cyber rates rose nearly 80% in some geographies. As a reminder, our index skews the large account business. However, small and middle market insurance rates continue to rise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. Turning to reinsurance. Guy Carpentera\u0302\u0080\u0099s U.S. Property Catastrophe Rate on Line Index showed increases of approximately 15% through midyear, the largest increase since 2006. Midyear renewals reflected one of the most challenging property markets in many years with pricing driven by inflation, escalating geopolitical risk and loss experience. Throughout the first half of the year, we saw some reinsurers take tougher positions on specific terms and conditions and shift portfolios to limit capacity in certain lines of business or geographies. We remain focused on helping our clients navigate these challenging insurance and reinsurance markets and the heightened risk environment. Turning to our performance in the quarter. As I noted earlier, Marsh McLennan had excellent results. In the second quarter, we had 10% underlying revenue growth with 9% in RIS and 10% in consulting. This is a fantastic result considering the prior year second quarter underlying growth was 13%. Bottom line results were strong as well with adjusted operating income growth of 8% in the quarter compared to 24% growth a year ago. Looking at risk and insurance services. Second quarter revenue was a record $3.3 billion, up 5% compared with a year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to a second quarter record of $1 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 32.8%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion, up 5% compared with a year ago. Revenue growth was 9% on an underlying basis and supported by strong renewal growth and new business. U.S. and Canada had 10% underlying revenue growth. This marks U.S. and Canadaa\u0302\u0080\u0099s fifth consecutive quarter of double digit underlying revenue growth. International was also strong with underlying growth of 9%. Latin America grew 14%, Asia Pacific was up 11% and EMEA was up 7%. Guy Carpentera\u0302\u0080\u0099s second quarter revenue was $522 million up 9% on an underlying basis driven by strong retention in new business as well as rate increases, which continued at midyear. Guy Carpenter has now achieved underlying revenue growth of 9% or higher in four of the last five quarters. In the Consulting segment revenue was $2.1 billion and up 10% from a year ago on both a reported and underlying basis. This is Consultinga\u0302\u0080\u0099s fifth consecutive quarter of double digit underlying revenue growth. Adjusted operating income increased 4% to a second quarter high of $369 million. The adjusted operating margin was 19.3% down 20 basis points versus a year ago. Mercera\u0302\u0080\u0099s revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter up 7% on an underlying basis. Career grew 17% on an underlying basis, a record since we began reporting this line of business. We continue to see robust demand for solutions linked to workforce transformation and compensation and rewards. Health underlying revenue growth was also excellent at 10% in the quarter, reflecting growth across all geographies. This quartera\u0302\u0080\u0099s results continue to benefit from strong demand for our solutions, accelerating new business, higher retention, increased enrolled lives from a strong labor market and medical inflation. Wealth increased wealth increase 1% on an underlying basis. Reflecting modest growth and defined benefits, which offset a modest decline in investments. Our assets under management were $346 billion at the end of the second quarter down 12% from the prior year reflecting capital market and foreign exchange headwinds. In May, Mercer announced an agreement with Westpac to acquire BT Super Trust and advanced Asset Management Australia. This will create a $45 billion Mercer fund helping more than 850,000 Australians invest for retirement. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023. Oliver Wyman strong momentum continued. Revenue in the second quarter was $695 million, an increase of 16% on an underlying basis. This follows a 28% comparable in the second quarter of 2021 and reflects continued spend across all geographies. Overall, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m proud of our second quarter performance, which demonstrates the continued momentum across our business, despite a more uncertain macro environment. Now Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2022. Sure, Dan. Yeah, at least wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re very pleased with the hiring we did last year. As you know, we capitalized on our brand as a\u0302\u0080\u0093 our strong brand as an employer in the marketplace and some market dislocation. And ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s worked out exceedingly well for us. Our focus this year has been onboarding that talent and a success and bringing them to a level of productivity. As we noted last quarter, Guy Carpenter, the impact on Guy Carpenter was a bit earlier as expected than it will be at Marsh, but the talent we brought in has been very, very helpful at Marsh as well. We serve our clients in teams. And I think one of the things that feels particularly good about is just the cultural fit of these new colleagues, ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s worked out very, very well. So wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re on target from productivity. We slightly ahead and we feel terrific about the investments we made. You know, Dan, maybe one more thing to throw in, at least you talked about inflation and pricing in the commercial P&C market, a better asked about that, but our revenue line is also exposed to medical inflation. I noted that in my prepared remarks, but medical inflation also is a tailwind for us. Sure. Jimmy, just a little bit of background and Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll ask Martin and Dean to talk about some of the marketplace, some observations they have around the current marketplace. So, as I said earlier, prices reining up in both insurance and re-insurance. Insurers and reinsurers remain concerned about elevated cat losses over the last several years, including secondary perils. Theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re spending a lot of time better modeling and understanding secondary perils. Inflation, both core inflation but their concerns about social inflation as well. And then the frequency of large losses, insurers led the turn in the market several years ago. Now reinsurers are pressing on pricing and terms and conditions. So the things have changed a bit, but as I mentioned, retail pricing, insurance pricing remains up. Martin, maybe Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d ask you to share some observations first, and then wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ll ask Dean to talk about whata\u0302\u0080\u0099s going on in the reinsurance market. Thanks. Good. Thank you, Martin. And Dean, as I noted in my prepared remarks, therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s some segments of the reinsurance market are capacity constraints, maybe you can touch on that as you share some observations with Jimmy. Thanks, Dean."

            "name": "Nick Studer",
            "content": "Yeah. Dan, I mean, I think you summarized it well, Robert, thanks for the question. We are delighted with the continued progress really across all four of our regions wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been in double digit growth and the pipeline looks robust in all four of them. We have 12 different industry practices. The majority of those have been in double digit growth led by energy, by healthcare and life sciences, by retail banking, automotive and manufacturing and private capital. And Dan gave the nod to the broad range of capabilities that wea\u0302\u0080\u0099re seeing working again, led by some of our organizational effectiveness and operational efficiency work, but also restructuring, also finance and risk. There is quite a few countercyclical offerings in there. So we do think over time that sort of mid to high single digit growth will be all through the cycle average. And ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s obviously been faster recently. But the pipeline still looks good as Dan mentioned. Yes, I mean, I think sort of broad growth and robust pipeline. We are prepared in terms of our client offerings. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s important that when the cycle changes and the questions change, we are prepared with answers for those new questions. And so wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve been preparing those offerings for quite a few years now. Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099d also say that the pandemic created very different market conditions in each of the sectors we serve. So some of our client segments have been having a very tough time for quite a long time and others have been booming. But overall, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve see no slow down in the pipeline to-date."

            "content": "Thank you, John. Well, the risk of repeating things just to get some numbers squared away, pricing is strong in second quarter, which is very challenging for our clients is as the question noted. Rates continue to moderate though, in the course, which is good news for our clients, FINPRO rates are up 16%, which is really driven by cyber core FINPRO. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s actually flattish and cyber is driving growth there, property up 6%, casualty up 6%, which is just upper take over the prior quarter. And so those are the real drivers for it. Ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s difficult to see any inflationary impacts in the rates, although ita\u0302\u0080\u0099s possible that we got a declining rate increase which would have been faster in a normal inflationary environment. And of course, our clients have some options. We manage some captives and theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re able to retain more risk in their captive to deal with those issues."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you, John and good morning. As Dan and John mentioned our strong financial performance in the second quarter reflects continued momentum across our business. We saw another quarter of double underlying revenue growth and meaningful earnings growth despite tough prior year revenue and expense comparisons. We generated GAAP EPS of $1.91 in the quarter and adjusted EPS of $1.89 up 8% from a year ago. This comes on top of adjusted EPS growth of 33% in the second quarter of last year. Operating income was $1.4 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion. Our adjusted operating margin was 26.7% in the second quarter up 30 basis points year-over-year. John covered our business operating results. So Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll cover some of the other aspects of our performance and outlook. Adjusted corporate expense was $62 million in the second quarter. Based on our current outlook, we expect approximately $142 million for the second half of the year. Foreign exchange was a headwind of $0.03 to our adjusted due to the strength of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies. Year-to-date foreign exchange represents $0.07 headwind. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels. We expect FX to be a headwind of $0.01 in the third quarter and $0.05 in the fourth quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $59 million in the quarter. For the full year 2022, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $2 million in the second quarter on a GAAP basis and $3 million on an adjusted basis and mainly reflects gains in our private equity portfolio. Interest expense in the second quarter was $114 million compared to $110 million in the second quarter of 2021. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense to be about $118 million in each of the third and fourth quarters. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 23.7% compared with 24.4% in the second quarter of last year. The lower rate this quarter was driven by a decline in our underlying tax rate to 25% from 25.5% a year ago. Our tax rate in the quarter also included a benefit from favorable discrete items, the largest of which related to stock compensation. When we give forward guidance tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume an adjusted effective tax rate of around 25% for 2022. Turning to capital management, our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $11.8 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is March of 2023, when $350 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2022 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, the ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how our M&A pipeline develops. Last week, we raised our quarterly dividend 10% marking our 13th consecutive year of dividend increases. In the second quarter, we bought back 3.8 million shares of our stock for $600 million reflecting our strong financial position and outlook for cash generation. Our acquisition pipeline remains active. As John mentioned, we recently announced Mercera\u0302\u0080\u0099s agreement with Westpac to combine the BT and Mercer Super Trust in Australia. We are also looking forward to Mercera\u0302\u0080\u0099s acquisition of Advanced Asset Management from Westpac. We are excited about these deals and how they extend Mercera\u0302\u0080\u0099s leading position in OCIO. Our cash position at the end of this quarter was $909 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.1 billion and included $275 million for dividends, $232 million for acquisitions and $600 million for share repurchases. For the first six months uses of cash totaled $1.9 billion and included $547 million for dividends, $273 million for acquisitions and $1.1 billion for share repurchases. Regarding the outlook for the rest of 2022, we remain on track for a terrific year. Our top line comps get tougher in the second half, and therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s greater uncertainty in the macro outlook. However, with our strong first half, we see underlying growth at the upper end of our full-year guidance of mid single digits or higher. We also continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and solid growth in adjusted EPS. With that, Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099m happy to turn it back to Dan. Sure. As we consistently say, we try not to focus too much on free cash flow growth in a particular quarter, even over the course of a particular year, because it can be a lot of volatility. But when we look back over a long stretch of time going back a decade or more, wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve delivered double digit growth in free cash flow and our outlook for free cash flow growth is that will continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth. You pointed out the comparison challenge. The early part of the year is our seasonal low for cash generation because of our variable comp payouts. And the first half of this year has a tough comparable. Our variable comp pools were up substantially last year based on our significant good performance. And so you have that tough comp against the low base and thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s been the drag early in the year. As you pointed out and not that I want to focus on cash flow in a particular quarter, but in the second quarter we were up 8%. But I think the bottom line is our outlook for cash generation remains strong. Yes, sure. And when you look at our guidance over the course of the full year, so $0.07 in the first half, and then $0.06 across the back half, theya\u0302\u0080\u0099re pretty meaningful impact when you look back over the last several. And actually tracks pretty well with our 10-K disclosure of 10% move in the dollar against major currencies what that means. For the third quarter though, and wea\u0302\u0080\u0099ve talked about this in the past, there is a modest impact and that is what we are modelling, assuming that rates stay where they are today. Really what you see in the third quarter is because of dollar placement activity in London a weak pound actually act as a bit of a hedge against a strong dollar relative to the other currencies. And that pound impact that natural hedge impact, if you will is most significant in this coming third quarter. And so what you see is a benefit from the weak pound offsetting some of the other currencies. But as we get to the fourth quarter, thata\u0302\u0080\u0099s when that benefit as strong and then we see that $0.05 in the fourth quarter. Yes. Generally not significantly, most of our margin is going to be driven by our operating performance."

First quarter 2022 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company\u2019s website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today\u2019s earnings release. I'll now turn this over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nDan Glaser: Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan started 2022 strong, and we are well-positioned for another good year. Our top line momentum continued. We generated the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth and the highest first quarter underlying growth in over two decades, with each of our businesses showing strength. Our adjusted operating income grew 12%. This comes despite a tough comparable of 20% growth in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS growth was 16%, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And we saw modest margin expansion despite the substantial investments we made in organic hiring last year. Overall, a strong start to the year. At Marsh McLennan, advancing good in the world is important to us. In our view, great company have to not only do well and deliver for investors, but also do good and make a broader contribution to society. We believe in order to deliver long-term value for shareholders, we also have to be a good employer, a good global citizen, and bring our best to our clients. We are proud of our track record on ESG and recently released our second Environmental, Social and Governance report. Our report highlights the many ways in which we are confronting the most complex ESG challenges of our time, both within our own company and on behalf of clients. We made progress on several ESG initiatives. For example, we are committed to energy transition and achieve the carbon neutral certification in 2021. We also declared a new goal of being net-zero by 2050, with a target of reducing carbon emissions 50% by 2030. We are committed to inclusion and diversity. We launched our inclusion and diversity center of excellence and enhanced our D&I disclosure in the areas of pay equity, workforce representation and talent flows. And we added Gaye Erkan to our Board of Directors, furthering our commitment to increased gender diversity on our Board. We are also working across our businesses to help clients address the broad spectrum of complex ESG issues, such as climate change, diversity and inclusion, affordable healthcare, cybersecurity, and sustainable investing, among others. I want to highlight several recent examples of how we are developing ESG solutions for clients. Marsh launched the new directors and officers liability insurance initiative that recognize -- recognizes U.S. based clients with superior ESG frameworks. Guy Carpenter arranged FloodSmart Re catastrophe bonds for FEMA to secure capital markets based flood reinsurance coverage for its NFIP program. These bonds help FEMA pay for NFIP claims when disaster strikes. Mercer continues to be a leader in helping firms quantify and address pay equity, as well as diversity and inclusion challenges. As an example, our recently released stepping up for equity study provides insights on closing the opportunity gap for Black Americans. Oliver Wyman helped clients pursue commercially viable climate transitions, working with CDP, the World Economic Forum, the United Nations, and others to set agendas and build consensus on the issue of climate change. We are also helping clients develop low-carbon business models and manage risks associated with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. As we do our part to accelerate this transition, we recognize that a secure energy supply is crucial for the global economy and society as a whole. This is especially true in the context of today's geopolitical environment. We believe all communities are best served by working with both operators of clean energy assets and traditional energy companies to make the transition as quickly and smooth as possible. The work we are doing across all of these ESG related areas has a direct impact on the communities where we live and operate. We are making a difference through disaster mitigation and recovery, promoting healthy societies, and diversity and inclusion. Overall, ESG continues to be an area where we see both significant growth potential, and an opportunity to benefit our clients, colleagues, and communities. I'd like to take a moment to comment on the war in Ukraine. We strongly condemn the Russian government invasion of Ukraine and are horrified by the tragic human toll this war is taking. On March 10th, we announced the decision to exit our business in Russia. In a minute, John will provide more detail on steps we've taken to support colleagues and serve our clients during this crisis. Turning to current economic conditions and the outlook for the rest of 2022. We see a picture with greater risks and uncertainties than when we enter the year. That said, we continue to see an environment that is supportive of growth. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect mid single digit or better underlying revenue growth for the full year. We also expect solid growth in adjusted EPS and to extend our track record of annual margin expansion. Macro challenges like supply chain per pressures, energy market and commodity dislocations, rising cybersecurity concerns, and future of work, create demand for our services and opportunities to help clients. We also believe that over the long-term demand for our solutions will remain strong, given rising levels of complexity, volatility, and uncertainty across the business landscape. With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on the quarter.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks Dan and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results were strong. We had double-digit underlying revenue growth with all businesses positively contributing, and our adjusted operating in income hit a record level in the first quarter. Our strong star positions as well for 2022, despite greater uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook. Before I discuss market trends and our performance, I want to comment on our response to the crisis in Ukraine. As Dan noted, we condemned the Russian aggression and we are saddened by the human suffering the war in Ukraine has caused. Our primary concern is the wellbeing of colleagues affected by this crisis. We took a number of steps to assist them, including providing evacuation support for Ukrainian colleagues and creating assistance programs in Poland and Ukraine. In addition, we've established a humanitarian relief fund to help the Ukrainian people.  We're also bringing our capabilities and risk strategy and people to support clients as they grapple with the challenges of this conflict and its wider economic effects. Oliver Wyman is helping clients in the public and private sectors manage a wide scope of issues. We are working on government security in defense matters, helping a number of banks manage their exposure to the region, supporting energy clients with their supply chain considerations and assisting large manufacturers as they manage the risk of production shutdowns. Marsh is advising clients on risks around aircraft nationalization, cybersecurity, physical assets, supply chain, and transitioning away from Russian energy. Mercer is helping clients deal with capital market volatility, asset allocation and Russian exposures. We're also working to provide continued health coverage for Ukrainians leaving the country. Guy Carpenter is helping clients understand their exposures, portfolio concentrations and reinsurance recoveries. We're also advising clients on the complexities around sanctions and cause of loss, number of occurrences and claims aggregation. I'm extremely proud of how our firm has responded to this crisis. Overall, we are harnessing the power of Marsh McLennan to help our colleagues and our clients in this moment that matters. Now, let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Rate increases in the marketplace continue to persist, reflecting losses and concerns about the impact of inflation on claims and the firm reinsurance market. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 11% year-over-year. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. Looking at pricing by line. The Marsh Market Index showed global property insurance was up 7% and global casualty rates were up mid single digits on average. Global financial and professional lines, excluding cyber, increased high single digits, while cyber rates more than doubled in some geographies. As a reminder, our index skews the large account business, however, small and middle market insurance rates continue to arise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. Turning to reinsurance April 1 renewals largely reflected a continuation of the January 1 pricing environment. The industry remains well capitalized, but finding capacity is challenging in specific segments. This reflects ongoing and emerging issues such as the frequency of severe events, cyber, climate change, and core and social inflation. Overall, at April 1, U.S. property catastrophe rates were up in the high single digits for non-loss impacted accounts. While loss impacted accounts generally increased in a range of 10% to 30%. U.S. cyber rates were up mid teens or higher depending on loss activity. Japanese property catastrophe rates increased low single digits. We remain focused on helping clients navigate challenging insurance and reinsurance markets, and the evolving risk environment. Turning to our performance in the quarter. As I noted earlier, Marsh McLennan had strong results. In the first quarter, we had double-digit underlying revenue growth in both RIS and consulting. Adjusted operating income grew 12% on top of 20% in the first quarter of 2021, a terrific result. The first quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth, a longest stretch in over two decades. Looking at risk and insurance services. First quarter revenue was $3.5 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis. This is the third quarter in the last 12 months risk and insurance grew 10% or better, the best trend since 2003. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $1.2 billion, while our adjusted operating margin declined 10 basis points to 36.5% reflecting investments in the business. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago. Revenue growth was 11% on an underlying basis. We had excellent renewal growth and we continue to see strong new business. U.S. and Canada had 10% underlying revenue growth. This marks the U.S. and Canada's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth. International was also strong with underlying revenue growth of 11%. Asia-Pacific was up 17%. LATIN America grew 16% and EMEA was up 9%. Guy Carpenter's first quarter revenue was $1 billion up 11% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in new business and exceptional retention. Guy Carpenter has now achieved underlying revenue growth of over 10% three of the last four quarters. In the Consulting segment, revenue of $2 billion was a first quarter record, up 7% from a year ago or 10% on an underlying basis. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 10% or higher growth. Adjusted operating increased 9% to a first quarter record of $402 million. The adjusted operating margin was 20.6%, up 10 basis points versus a year ago. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis, the fourth consecutive quarter of 6% or higher growth. Career grew 16% on an underlying basis. We continue to see robust demand for solutions linked to new ways of working, skills gaps, workforce transformation, and D&I issues like pay equity. Health underlying revenue growth was strong at 9% in the quarter, reflecting growth across all geographies. This quarter's results benefited from strong demand for our services, higher retention, rising employment and medical inflation. Wealth increased 2% on an underlying basis, reflecting modest growth in both investment management and defined benefits. Our assets under management were $388 billion at the end of the first quarter, down 7% sequentially as net inflows were more than offset by capital market declines. However, compared to the first quarter last year, AUM was up 2%. Oliver Wyman's momentum continued despite starting to lap tougher comparables to an outstanding 2021. Revenue in the first quarter was $667 million, an increase of 17% on an underlying basis. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and reflects continued strong demand across all geographies. Overall, I'm pleased with our excellent first quarter performance and it sets us up for a good year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2022.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John and good morning. As Dan, John mentioned our financial performance in the first quarter marked a strong start to the year. We saw another great quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth, meaningful earnings growth, despite tough expense comparison. We generated GAAP EPS of $2.10 in the quarter and adjusted EPS of $2.30 up 16% from a year ago. Operating income was $1.4 billion. And adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, a first quarter record. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points in the first quarter to 29.7%, despite the impact of the significant organic investments we made last year. We remain excited about the benefits we expect from these investments, but they come with upfront costs we continue to absorb in the short term. The first quarter was also active -- an active quarter for capital management. We completed the highest quarterly level of share purchases since the third quarter of 2015. The pace of acquisition activity continues, with the recent announcement of our acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton's MENA practice. And we announced an additional $5 billion share purchase authorization. John covered our business operating results. So, I'll cover some of the other aspects of our performance and outlook. Adjusted corporate expense was $60 million in the first quarter. Foreign exchange was a headwind of $0.04 to our adjusted EPS. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a modest headwind in the second quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $62 million in a quarter. For the full year 2022, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $250 million. Investment income was $26 million in the first quarter on a GAAP basis or $17 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects gains in our private equity portfolio. Interest expense in the first quarter was $110 million compared to $118 million in the first quarter of 2021, reflecting lower long-term debt balances. Based on our current forecast, we expect a similar level of interest expense in the second quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.1% compared with 24.3% in the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discreet items, the largest of which was the accounting for share based compensation similar to a year ago. Excluding discreet items are effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume an adjusted effective tax rate of around 25% for 2022. In the first quarter, we recorded a $52 million charge, which is mostly non-cash relating to our exit from Russia. This has been treated as a noteworthy item and excluded from adjusted results. We reached an agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian business to local management who will operate independently in the Russian market. This situation resulted in the deconsolidation of our business and an associated write-down of our carrying value. In terms of ongoing impact, revenues and operating income from Russia are not significant. Turning to capital management. Now balance sheet. We entered the quarter with total debt of $11.7 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity isn't until March of 2023. In the first quarter, we repurchase 3.2 million shares of our stock for $500 million, reflecting our strong financial position and outlook for cash generation. We continue to expect to deploy approximately the $4 billion of capital in 2022 across dividends, acquisitions and share purchases. The ultimate level of share purchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develop. As we've consistently said, we favor attractive acquisitions over share purchases, as we view high quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long-term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time. And each year, we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $772 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $813 million and included $272 million for dividends, $41 million for acquisitions and $500 million for share repurchases. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we see continued strong demand for our advice and solutions, even though we start to lap tougher growth comparisons in the second quarter. The investments we made in hiring last year will continue to be a headwind to expense in the first half, but as we get further into the third quarter, this becomes less of a drag. Also, we recognize there is a higher level of uncertainty and outlooks caused by the war in Ukraine and its potential impact on the global economy. Overall, our strong start leaves us well positioned for another good year in 2022. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver mid single digit or higher underlying growth, solid growth in adjusted EPS and margin expansion. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call back to Dan.\nDan Glaser: Thanks Mark. And operator, we're ready to go to Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly.  Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the organic growth, another double-digit growth quarter. So, it sounds like you guys are still expecting that the revenue benefit from the hires that you guys did last year is more something that we should think about coming in the future. Can you give us a sense if there was any benefit from those hires that positively impacted the Q1, and how we should think about the rest of the year? Or is this still more a benefit you expect in 2023 and beyond?\nDan Glaser: Sure. Sure, Elyse and good morning. I'll take it to begin with and then I'll hand off to John to add some detail to it. There's many factors which are underpinning our growth. We are in fundamental growth markets. You look at the areas of risk, strategy and people, the demand is all on the rise, and we are the most strategically positioned company in the world as an adviser in those areas. So, I think that broadly, and fundamentally, we've got some competitive advantages, which are assisting growth and will continue to do so. The hiring strategy of last year has given us a mild benefit thus far, in particular on Guy Carpenter. But John, why don't you go into that in a little bit more detail?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Dan. Elyse, as I noted earlier, we're very pleased with our start to the year. Growth was strong pretty much across the board and I think you're referring to strat hires in RIS. But I want to note the growth in consulting was quite strong in the quarter as well as we're seeing good demand for our services across the board. We're pleased with the start in terms of the strat hire impact. As Dan noted, the impact was a little bit more notable in Guy Carpenter at this point. But it will take some time for them to become really fully accretive to our revenue expectations. It's a two to three-year period. So, our focus is on onboarding them as successfully as possible, but so far so good. The quarter really creates some good momentum for us. Obviously, there's a macroeconomic uncertainty given the war, given rising rates, supply chain issues, inflation, although I'd note inflation is generally a good thing for us on capital markets volatility, but we're well-positioned. As I said earlier, there's strong demand for our services, and we expect a good strong year of growth.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my follow-up on, within RIS, if I look at the other operating expenses on an adjusted basis, they look to be flat to down modestly versus last Q1, which represented a pretty tough comp. So, any color on the drivers of that, given that I would think T&E should have been higher there? And how should we think about the outlook for the other Op expenses over the balance of the year?\nDan Glaser: Sure. I mean, similar to last year, the growth of expense was virtually all related to compensation and benefits. And so, we continue to manage our expenses as we've always done. And when we look at the start of this year, yeah, things like T&E are a bit higher than what they were and we would hope that, that would continue, because it would point to more of a return to a normal operating environment. However, our searches for efficiency never ends. Our goal -- and I think I've said it on previous calls in the past, I mean, a healthy comp and ben as a percentage of revenue is a good thing for our business, for a people business. But continued focus on reducing all other operating expenses, particularly as we grow the firm bigger and bigger and use our -- some of our scale advantages to get some economies is something that's a core of how we operate the firm. So, I don't think you're going to see a lot of growth in the all other expense category. In fact, over time, you'll see reductions there. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Bhullar with JP Morgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hi. Good morning. You spoke about this a little bit in your comments as well. But can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of just pricing in both the commercial market and in reinsurance. And it seems like the prices are still up, but the pace is slowing down. And what sort of pushback are you getting, if any, from your clients on the study increases? And what are some of the things that they're doing whether increasing retention or otherwise?\nDan Glaser: It's a good question. John, do you want to take that?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Jimmy, as I noted in my prepared remarks, the insurance and reinsurance markets remain pretty challenging for our clients. Having said that, rate increases are decelerating and in at least most insurance markets around the world. Cyber, of course, is the most notable exception. For us, though, there is a mitigating impact of that rate deceleration around inflation and values. But let me ask Martin and Dean to comment a bit. Martin, maybe you could start, offer a bit more color on what's happening in the insurance market?\nMartin South: Sure. Thank you, John. Well, as you noted, it's the 18th consecutive quarter of rate increases. So, clients are weary, that's the concern. But they decelerated as I noted in the -- the last call we had, they came down by two points in last quarter, another two points this quarter to -- land at 11%. Geographically, still as I noted last time, there's one outlier, which is Latin America, where they saw modest rate increases, but have been flatter during the rest of the cycle. By product across the board growth, casualty still strong at 4%, property up 7%. FinPro lines, which includes cyber, 26%. If you're stripping that out, that comes down and we're still seeing double-digit and doubling of rates in cyber, over 110% in the U.S. And the U.K. rates up 100%. So, there's a lot more concerned about that, but otherwise, as noted a mild deceleration.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Martin. Dean?\nDean Klisura: Thank you, John. As John mentioned earlier, the April 1 renewal reflected a continuation of the January 1 pricing environment. But there's challenges in the reinsurance market in certain segments that are driving pricing up. Examples of that would be the property catastrophe market where aggregate capacity continues to be constrained in the trading environment. Parts of the cyber market, including aggregate capacity for excess of loss contracts is currently a challenge and we're seeing double-digit pricing in the cyber market. And then, I would refer to segments of the London specialty market that are really being impacted by the Russia/Ukraine war, including more terrorism, political violence, aviation and marine coverages, we're experiencing very challenging renewals for excess of loss contracts. And then certainly retrocession capacity, again, as capital has flowed out of the ILS market in Bermuda and London, aggregate capacity for retrocession coverage continues to be very expensive and a challenge for our clients.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks Dean. Just one quick last point, Jimmy. We continue to invest heavily in data and analytics, really help our clients navigate the market and make the trade-offs ever for them. So, it's a client-by-client outcome ultimately.\nJimmy Bhullar: Okay. And if I could just ask one more on Russia. Is the -- the Russia directly, obviously, is a very small part of your business, Ukraine as well. But the full impact of the conflict in terms of any sort of collateral impacts or something, is that fully reflected in your results? Or is there something that would be a lag in future periods, because it sometimes takes clients time to react? And like, should we expect anything noticeable in 2Q from Russia?\nDan Glaser: Yeah. There's no inherent buildup issues that we're aware of, but there are implications to this war -- this war in Ukraine that are yet to play out. And so, we don't know what those are. What's the impact on energy prices? What's the impact on GDP globally, in particular, in Europe? Is there a continuation of taking size, which creates more division in the world? And what's the impact on that basis in terms of the last 20 years globalization developments? And so, there's a lot of factors, Jimmy. And that's part of the uncertainty that we've all talked about. We're doing very well. In some ways, we thrive in periods of uncertainty and volatility, because our clients want to talk issues through and we're a company that they turn to on some of these issues. But in terms of headwinds that it could conceivably create, I think, it's going to play out for quite a while now. We'll just have to see how it goes. But we've demonstrated in many different periods of time, whether it's a global financial crisis, COVID, et cetera, that we are an extremely resilient organization.\nJimmy Bhullar: Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning everybody. My first question, I guess, maybe continuing your last comment, Dan. Clearly, you have a very strong track record of posting expenses that are lower than revenues. But with the significant hires you had last year, if we do head into a recession this year, do you think that you can still achieve margin expansion?\nDan Glaser: We're going to have margin expansion this year. And it will be our 15th year -- consecutive years of margin expansion. We run our business where every year our revenue growth will exceed our expense growth. And it's not every quarter, but it's most quarters and it's certainly every year. It's the way we approach the business. And we have a tremendous capability of managing that expense base in both good times and tough times. Some ways, managing your expense base in tough times is easier than managing your expense base in good times where everybody wants to do need in different things. So -- but ultimately, we're comfortable that we've got growth momentum, and that will continue based upon the industries that we serve.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And my second question is with the Fed hiking rates now, fiduciary income, I'm assuming it's going to move up. Do you expect to have that flow all to the bottom line? Or do you have some maybe additional investments that you'd see taking action on or taking advantage of the higher margin coming from fiduciary income?\nDan Glaser: No. It's a good question. So, Mark, do you want to take that?\nMark McGivney: Yeah. Yaron, good morning. That fiduciary interest income is certainly a source of upside for us and exactly how much and when -- when we see the benefit all depends on and when rates move. But the vast majority of that would just flow right through to the bottom line. In 2019, we had $105 million of interest income. Last year, it was $15 million and we've overcome that. These days, we're averaging about $10 million of fiduciary assets. So, if rates move across the world where our balances are, by 100 basis points, that's $100 million of upside.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on that if I can. Do clients push for -- pushback against the increases when fiduciary income is rising? Or are those being significantly separate?\nDan Glaser: No. It's a good question. And I've been in the business for 40 years. Clients don't want to get involved in the paying the 27 underwriters who are on their account and some of those things are semiannual payments and some are even monthly or quarterly. It is an administrative complexity that clients have no interest in being part of. We take our fiduciary responsibilities very seriously. So, it's not like we can invest long on fiduciary assets. So, it's all the short end of the curve. But we would anticipate no pushback on getting some income -- some fiduciary income because the fact of the matter is, for a number of years, this has only been a one-way traffic in the direction of down. And so, there's been many years where we've done an awful lot of work around billings and payments in which there was very little or no compensation related to it. So, we're looking at this as a potentially large upside to us.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Second question. I was hoping you could frame, I guess, clients' willingness to spend on ESG? How has that been developing? And is there any difference based on client size?\nDan Glaser: Yeah. No. It's a very good question. And in some ways, the addressable market for ESG has not yet been determined. It's going to go wide. It's getting larger every year. And fundamentally, I think that every company from private or public midsize or larger is going out to demonstrate that they're a good company. And they demonstrate that in a multitude of different ways, but to -- with tight labor markets, that's the kind of company that people want to work for. Clients want to be associated with companies who are doing good work in the world. But I think it's an interesting question. I'd like to go around the horn a little bit and John can talk about it. And then maybe Martine and Nick can address it a little bit, because they're seeing a lot of ESG benefit in their results. But John?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Dan. Meyer, we're quite excited about our role here and the ability to impact clients and their future. And it's contributing positively to our growth now, but we're in the very early stages of what's possible here across all the businesses. Dan added some of the work that we're doing in his prepared remarks. But again, we're developing new solutions, new products and working with our clients every single day. We're part of the sustainable markets initiative overall as a company. So, we're excited about that. Nick, maybe I'll ask you to comment first. You're doing a lot of work, particularly around climate, around broader issues as well.\nNick Studer: Yeah. John, thank you. Thank you, Meyer for the question. The  has been working, a great deal with companies across sectors to help plan for a smart climate transition along the lines that Dan described in his prepared comments. As you know, we largely work with the larger company, so I can't talk to the segmentation part of your question. But whether it's in financial services, supporting backhaul industry as they move to support their clients, or whether it's with some of the hard-to-abate sectors like steel, like some of the transportation sectors. We see an enormous amount of work on our climate and sustainability cracks more than doubled last year. It's as big as some of our significant industry practices already.\nJohn Doyle: Martine, maybe you could comment? Obviously, we see big demand in career services, but are also doing a lot of work in investments.\nMartine Ferland: No. Absolutely John, and thanks for the question Meyer. We've been pioneering in ESG for many, many years now. First and foremost, the transition to the low-carbon economy. So, the investors or clients who work with us in managing their assets, they want to understand the transition to a lower net-zero emission economy and also the impact of, for example, the  they're making and their exposure to Russia, which falls under for them, their ESG policies. So, we're helping them, look at this and the consequences on oil supply, the energy strategy, et cetera. So, there's high demand for research, for advice, for modeling of the risk that are associated with that and the rewards of various investment strategies. And as you mentioned, John, of course, in the diversity, equity and inclusion domain, that's another place where we've been very active. We have many studies that help clients bridge the gender gap or the race and ethnicity gap. We do workforce analytics, we do pay equity. We have clients that build diverse workforces. And that's been such a tough of mine agenda item for our clients in the last couple of years. We just issued, as we said in the opening remarks, a stepping up for equity study where we work with 50 clients to identify the techniques, the strategies that you can employ for employers to really help close the gap on opportunities for Black Americans. And there's a G in the ESG, and that's also been always on our agenda. When you think about the work we do for executive compensation, DB and DC, the pension fund governance advice, our OCIO business is very much depend on different governance model that gives agility and integrity to the investment. So, that's really top of mind of our clients and its business that's been growing really fast over the last few years.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Martine. What's happening at Marsh?\nNick Studer: Thank you, John. As exciting things going on in Marsh, we feel that a resilience index to have start  to see their progress on that business. We're testing hypotheses on clients about how a positive score can impact on their loss cost going forward in an initial study on D&O rates as mentioned in your remarks. It's showing that claims can be dispensed earlier and a lower outcome as companies seem to be doing good. We're testing that hypothesis in other areas of the business, other casualty lines that offset social inflation. And property as well where companies are investing heavily in social, in pollution protection and so forth, will make an impact there. We feel that we're going to back that up with the data strategy that we have and make a positive for our clients as they look ahead, and it's a good work for us too.\nJohn Doyle: Terrific. Thank you. Dean, one last one?\nDean Klisura: Thanks John. Obviously, climate change is a top priority for Guy Carpenter's clients and we're working very closely with them to support them in these efforts. Obviously, helping them understand physical risk to climate change across their portfolios, across the world, and we're doing a lot of modeling and analytics work there to help them support there. We're inviting them on regulatory requests that come in, that want us access climate. We do credit rating advisory. Lots of the questions about the impact on climate change. And last, John, I would mention structuring transitional reinsurance solutions to help kind of mitigate that exposure for our clients.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks Dean.\nDan Glaser: Thanks. So, you can see, Meyer, we're all over the ESG space and expect it to underpin our growth in future years. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to clarify a comment on the reductions in other G&A expenses over time. I guess, was that a comment for this year? Or is that over a medium term timeframe? And also just want to get a sense for what's driving that. Because I know in the past, Dan, you've spoken about the operational excellence program, which might be contributing. But I'm also wondering, are there any sort of other sort of like real estate optimization or any other cost save programs that you're implementing as a result of some of the changes that have been put in place due to COVID-19, and what that means for the workplace? Is that also a driver that's coming through in that comment as well?\nDan Glaser: Yeah. It absolutely is, David. Ultimately, the way we run our business is -- one of the operative words that we use is more. We want to get better every year. We want to provide our clients with more capabilities with less internal costs. And so, our search for efficiency is a core part of this executive team's job and something that we're very focused on. And whether it's real estate, more purposeful travel and tech modernization, operational efficiency gains, the fact that we've got several new faces around the table and new faces come up with good ideas and fresh ideas. And there's lots of ways of running the business. And our goal over time is supporting our clients with a combination of really good comp and ben, because that makes us a strong company and helps us be an employer of choice in the industries that we operate. But always relentlessly going after all other expenses that have just fundamental aspects of running a multinational. So, this is a midterm and a long-term downward trend in our expense base in all other expenses. Next question -- or you have a follow-up, David?\nDavid Motemaden: Yeah. I do have a follow-up. That's helpful, Dan. I appreciate that. And you mentioned a lot of new faces around the table, which is obviously -- you guys have been prolific in hiring. I guess, I look at that $30 million of legal claims that you guys have incurred this quarter. I think it's around $90 million over the last five quarters. Is there a way to approximate how much revenues are coming with those just from some of the teams that you guys have hired? Is it $50 million? Is it $90 million? Is there just like a rule of thumb that we can think about for the potential revenue impact over the next few years as those people are onboarded?\nDan Glaser: Yeah. I mean, I think, the way to look at it is, our revenue over the next several years should benefit from the organic hiring that we did last year. I mean, you look at it on the basis of -- last year, we had an opportunity to make significant organic investments in building our business. And it's something that we always focus on delivering good results today, but always focusing on the future and how we can build a better company. And this is an opportunity that John and I haven't seen in our careers in terms of being able to build the business on an organic basis. And so, we had the opportunity and we had the means, and last year's strong levels of organic growth helped provide those means and meant that we could still deliver good results to investors last year, while we were making these strong organic investments. You have to know that we all know around the table that organic investments are always short-term dilutive, and it's harder to do in some ways and acquisitions just by the P&L map, but we made the right decision and press forward. The vast majority of that expense is comp and ben. And the way I would look at it is we've got another two or three quarters and then the expense growth is going to be in the rearview mirror, but the capability and the growth kicker will remain. And so, this is a huge benefit to the overall organization. We're not going to quantify whether Henry and Sally are delivering today. I mean, we're a big organization. We've added to our market leading capabilities. We like where we are positioned right now in terms of the performance of some of that strategic hiring, and this is going to be a best with for us in coming years as well as this year.\nDavid Motemaden: Understood. Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Sure. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Yeah. Thanks. A couple of quick questions here. First, maybe Mark, free cash flow this quarter was pretty weak and it looked like there was a lot of paid compensation. How much of that was called one-time in nature just from all the hires that you had last year? And kind of how do I think about free cash flow here going forward?\nMark McGivney: Sure. Good morning, Brian. So, I'd start by saying, if you look back over a long stretch of time, our track record on free cash flow growth has been terrific. With the last decade, we've generated double-digit free cash flow growth. And you expect that given our strong earnings and our outlook is -- for continued strong earnings growth and continued strong free cash flow growth. If you look back over that last decade though, you'd see a lot of volatility and you see that volatility just in the last couple of years. So, we generally would stay away from talking about predicting free cash flow in a given year, although we expect strong cash generation this year. Now as you pointed out, first quarters typically are low for cash generation, because we do pay out the majority of our variable comp in the first quarter. And the reduction this year was because our variable comp payouts were up. And that was mostly a function of the strong performance we had last year, both on new business growth and sales related plans as well as just the overall growth in earnings and the bonus plans that accrue from that.\nBrian Meredith: Great. And then my next question, just curious perhaps you could talk a little bit about what the M&A kind of environment landscape looks like right now, given all of the uncertainties right now with respect to what economic growth could look like over the next 12 months and I wonder if you could comment on that.\nDan Glaser: Sure. I'll start and then I'll hand to John. M&A is a big part of our organization and not just for the last decade, but literally since its inception. We don't have a budget around acquisitions. We're cautious when we make acquisitions. We like to cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. As has been commented in the marketplace before many times, over the last decade, multiples have risen. So, therefore, we're even more selective than we used to be and we're careful around pro formas, because most of the companies that we acquire are private. And we want to really understand the ongoing characteristics of the business and not some fancy dressed up pro forma statement. And so, the one thing that we're committed to is capital deployment. And so, we look at -- we favor share repurchase -- we favor acquisitions over share repurchase, but we certainly favor share repurchase over building more cash on the balance sheet. And so, we will utilize that circa $4 billion between the dividend, which is 7% and growing acquisitions and then share repurchase. But the M&A pipeline, ebbs and flows, it looks pretty good right now. But we don't really have -- we wouldn't at this stage to have a strong idea of where we would end up the year on that because many of the discussions we have are exclusive and the discussion is essentially the company decided whether they want to join forces with us or stay private. But John, do you want to talk about the pipeline, or how we're looking at M&A these days?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Good morning, Brian. We did three small deals in the quarter, one at Oliver Wyman, in Australia, one at M&A here, of course, in the United States, and then we did one at Mercer Marsh Benefits in France. So, we remain very active in the market. The pipeline, as Dan noted, is pretty solid. Generally speaking, the pipeline is deepest in the middle market brokerage space, and that's typically where we see some of our best and most attractive opportunities. But I would point out, we've done some more at Oliver Wyman, a lot of work at Oliver Wyman of late, not just in the quarter, but in the later part of last year. You may have seen that we recently announced that we expect to close on Booz Allen Hamilton's Middle Eastern business sometime in the second quarter. So, we'll see how the market evolves. Part of the dynamic here is our reputation as a buyer is very strong in these markets. And so, we get a good look at very attractive assets.\nBrian Meredith: Thanks.\nBrian Meredith: Next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Just on EMEA within RIS, these results were particularly strong. Just curious if you could give us some color on sort of how demand and trading trends developed, I guess, as the quarter went on and as geopolitical a little more complicated?\nDan Glaser: Sure. John?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Sure, Ryan. Yeah. We're pleased with our start in EMEA. We had good growth in the U.K. As we've shared in the past, for Continental Europe, the first quarter is a big part of the overall year. So, we're pleased to get off to a strong start. I think the one area that was probably notable on the RIS side is the impact of capital markets, the slowdown in M&A, the slowdown in IPOs. We began to see a bit of an impact as the quarter went on. But overall, demand again for our services remains quite strong and we feel good about how we're positioned all over the world, but in EMEA, in particular.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then, on the Mercer side, results were strong again there as well. Could you maybe just remind us, is there a seasonality to discretionary aspect of that? I wasn't sure if perhaps first quarter, there are more discretionary projects and maybe that's why it was outsized, so it's not even throughout the year. And also curious, I guess, for Martine, on the wealth side, with higher interest rates and choppier markets, what are the headwinds and tailwinds the debt produces?\nDan Glaser: Are you sneaking in two questions?\nRyan Tunis: I might have, Dan. Sorry.\nDan Glaser: Thanks. Martine?\nMartine Ferland: Yeah. Thank you, Ryan. Well, first, you asked about discretionary project, and I would say, no. This is not -- there's no cycle to this. It's pretty much through the year. It's big project that clients work with us. And there's still lots of demand for these projects. So, of course, we always keep an eye on the outlook. In terms of potential recession, as we know, this is the discretionary projects are a little bit more sensitive to that than other parts of the business. But so far, so good. The demand is really strong. And we see the immediate, a very strong outlook for the year. And you just think about the solutions that we're solving through with our clients in the discretionary projects, whether they are the future of work or -- and there's a link here to your question on the volatility on the wealth business, because when there's uncertainty clients need us to do more modeling or more planning around the investments in the pension plan. So, the bottom line is it's not seasonal. And just to complete the thought on your question on the wealth side, of course, the capital markets have been creating some headwinds on the short-term basis or part of the business that's linked to our assets under management. We call it the outsourced Chief Investment Officer business, OCIO. It's a fantastic business. It's given us many, many years of strong growth. We have strong flows. But, of course, on the short-term, as this business grows in proportion to our portfolio, we will maybe see a little bit more volatility there, but we're able to manage that in the grand scheme of the firm. And we've done so this quarter, because it has been negatively impacted since the beginning of the year. The other thing -- the other end on this, and you've alluded to that in your question is the -- first of all, the AUM portfolio, our assets are diversified. So, there's some risk management in that equity fixed income alternatives. In the long run, it will grow. It's also that this business now is larger than our traditional DB business. And therefore, over the long run, we also see that as a tailwind. And the market volatilities just creates demand for stronger governance, better agility and moving assets from one to the next. And you'll see this as interest rates go up and the pension funding gets better. You'll see clients wanted to secure that and start shifting assets to fixed income and also provides them more opportunity to think of derisking that side of the business, which has been a trend for many years now.\nRyan Tunis: Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Perfect. Next question. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Bank of America.\nJoshua Shanker: You've been really generous with your time and we're at the end, so I'll be quick. Just one, easy one. Can we just talk about COVID in Asia-PAC right now? And what that means for the coming quarter and how you see that playing out?\nDan Glaser: Sure. I mean, I think, we -- I used the resilience before, it's not just us. I think the world has gotten pretty resilient in that. We're not in 2020 anymore, and we've been able to adapt to different ways that have occurred in certain segments, whether that's in Europe, U.S., Asia, I mean, the one thing about COVID is no part of the world actually escaped. And so, we don't see a tremendous impact on our results from COVID. It would be more of a softer potential impact on just any headwind on GDP or business development. But other than that, we feel pretty good. I mean, you just look at Marsh's results as an example, in Asia-PAC in the quarter, it wasn't -- it's not COVID free. It was pretty active in Asia-PAC. So, in some ways, in terms of impact on our results, we think COVID is pretty much in the rearview mirror as well, knock wood.\nJoshua Shanker: Alright. Thank you.\nDan Glaser: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan, for any closing remarks.\nDan Glaser: So, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter and a particular shout out to all of our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients. So, thank you very much.",

            "content": "Thank you, John. As John mentioned earlier, the April 1 renewal reflected a continuation of the January 1 pricing environment. But there's challenges in the reinsurance market in certain segments that are driving pricing up. Examples of that would be the property catastrophe market where aggregate capacity continues to be constrained in the trading environment. Parts of the cyber market, including aggregate capacity for excess of loss contracts is currently a challenge and we're seeing double-digit pricing in the cyber market. And then, I would refer to segments of the London specialty market that are really being impacted by the Russia/Ukraine war, including more terrorism, political violence, aviation and marine coverages, we're experiencing very challenging renewals for excess of loss contracts. And then certainly retrocession capacity, again, as capital has flowed out of the ILS market in Bermuda and London, aggregate capacity for retrocession coverage continues to be very expensive and a challenge for our clients. Thanks John. Obviously, climate change is a top priority for Guy Carpenter's clients and we're working very closely with them to support them in these efforts. Obviously, helping them understand physical risk to climate change across their portfolios, across the world, and we're doing a lot of modeling and analytics work there to help them support there. We're inviting them on regulatory requests that come in, that want us access climate. We do credit rating advisory. Lots of the questions about the impact on climate change. And last, John, I would mention structuring transitional reinsurance solutions to help kind of mitigate that exposure for our clients."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Dan Glaser",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm Dan Glaser, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is John Doyle, our Group President and COO; Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan started 2022 strong, and we are well-positioned for another good year. Our top line momentum continued. We generated the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying growth and the highest first quarter underlying growth in over two decades, with each of our businesses showing strength. Our adjusted operating income grew 12%. This comes despite a tough comparable of 20% growth in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted EPS growth was 16%, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. And we saw modest margin expansion despite the substantial investments we made in organic hiring last year. Overall, a strong start to the year. At Marsh McLennan, advancing good in the world is important to us. In our view, great company have to not only do well and deliver for investors, but also do good and make a broader contribution to society. We believe in order to deliver long-term value for shareholders, we also have to be a good employer, a good global citizen, and bring our best to our clients. We are proud of our track record on ESG and recently released our second Environmental, Social and Governance report. Our report highlights the many ways in which we are confronting the most complex ESG challenges of our time, both within our own company and on behalf of clients. We made progress on several ESG initiatives. For example, we are committed to energy transition and achieve the carbon neutral certification in 2021. We also declared a new goal of being net-zero by 2050, with a target of reducing carbon emissions 50% by 2030. We are committed to inclusion and diversity. We launched our inclusion and diversity center of excellence and enhanced our D&I disclosure in the areas of pay equity, workforce representation and talent flows. And we added Gaye Erkan to our Board of Directors, furthering our commitment to increased gender diversity on our Board. We are also working across our businesses to help clients address the broad spectrum of complex ESG issues, such as climate change, diversity and inclusion, affordable healthcare, cybersecurity, and sustainable investing, among others. I want to highlight several recent examples of how we are developing ESG solutions for clients. Marsh launched the new directors and officers liability insurance initiative that recognize -- recognizes U.S. based clients with superior ESG frameworks. Guy Carpenter arranged FloodSmart Re catastrophe bonds for FEMA to secure capital markets based flood reinsurance coverage for its NFIP program. These bonds help FEMA pay for NFIP claims when disaster strikes. Mercer continues to be a leader in helping firms quantify and address pay equity, as well as diversity and inclusion challenges. As an example, our recently released stepping up for equity study provides insights on closing the opportunity gap for Black Americans. Oliver Wyman helped clients pursue commercially viable climate transitions, working with CDP, the World Economic Forum, the United Nations, and others to set agendas and build consensus on the issue of climate change. We are also helping clients develop low-carbon business models and manage risks associated with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. As we do our part to accelerate this transition, we recognize that a secure energy supply is crucial for the global economy and society as a whole. This is especially true in the context of today's geopolitical environment. We believe all communities are best served by working with both operators of clean energy assets and traditional energy companies to make the transition as quickly and smooth as possible. The work we are doing across all of these ESG related areas has a direct impact on the communities where we live and operate. We are making a difference through disaster mitigation and recovery, promoting healthy societies, and diversity and inclusion. Overall, ESG continues to be an area where we see both significant growth potential, and an opportunity to benefit our clients, colleagues, and communities. I'd like to take a moment to comment on the war in Ukraine. We strongly condemn the Russian government invasion of Ukraine and are horrified by the tragic human toll this war is taking. On March 10th, we announced the decision to exit our business in Russia. In a minute, John will provide more detail on steps we've taken to support colleagues and serve our clients during this crisis. Turning to current economic conditions and the outlook for the rest of 2022. We see a picture with greater risks and uncertainties than when we enter the year. That said, we continue to see an environment that is supportive of growth. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect mid single digit or better underlying revenue growth for the full year. We also expect solid growth in adjusted EPS and to extend our track record of annual margin expansion. Macro challenges like supply chain per pressures, energy market and commodity dislocations, rising cybersecurity concerns, and future of work, create demand for our services and opportunities to help clients. We also believe that over the long-term demand for our solutions will remain strong, given rising levels of complexity, volatility, and uncertainty across the business landscape. With that, let me turn it over to John for his comments on the quarter. Thanks Mark. And operator, we're ready to go to Q&A. Sure. Sure, Elyse and good morning. I'll take it to begin with and then I'll hand off to John to add some detail to it. There's many factors which are underpinning our growth. We are in fundamental growth markets. You look at the areas of risk, strategy and people, the demand is all on the rise, and we are the most strategically positioned company in the world as an adviser in those areas. So, I think that broadly, and fundamentally, we've got some competitive advantages, which are assisting growth and will continue to do so. The hiring strategy of last year has given us a mild benefit thus far, in particular on Guy Carpenter. But John, why don't you go into that in a little bit more detail? Sure. I mean, similar to last year, the growth of expense was virtually all related to compensation and benefits. And so, we continue to manage our expenses as we've always done. And when we look at the start of this year, yeah, things like T&E are a bit higher than what they were and we would hope that, that would continue, because it would point to more of a return to a normal operating environment. However, our searches for efficiency never ends. Our goal -- and I think I've said it on previous calls in the past, I mean, a healthy comp and ben as a percentage of revenue is a good thing for our business, for a people business. But continued focus on reducing all other operating expenses, particularly as we grow the firm bigger and bigger and use our -- some of our scale advantages to get some economies is something that's a core of how we operate the firm. So, I don't think you're going to see a lot of growth in the all other expense category. In fact, over time, you'll see reductions there. Next question, please. It's a good question. John, do you want to take that? Yeah. There's no inherent buildup issues that we're aware of, but there are implications to this war -- this war in Ukraine that are yet to play out. And so, we don't know what those are. What's the impact on energy prices? What's the impact on GDP globally, in particular, in Europe? Is there a continuation of taking size, which creates more division in the world? And what's the impact on that basis in terms of the last 20 years globalization developments? And so, there's a lot of factors, Jimmy. And that's part of the uncertainty that we've all talked about. We're doing very well. In some ways, we thrive in periods of uncertainty and volatility, because our clients want to talk issues through and we're a company that they turn to on some of these issues. But in terms of headwinds that it could conceivably create, I think, it's going to play out for quite a while now. We'll just have to see how it goes. But we've demonstrated in many different periods of time, whether it's a global financial crisis, COVID, et cetera, that we are an extremely resilient organization. Next question, please. We're going to have margin expansion this year. And it will be our 15th year -- consecutive years of margin expansion. We run our business where every year our revenue growth will exceed our expense growth. And it's not every quarter, but it's most quarters and it's certainly every year. It's the way we approach the business. And we have a tremendous capability of managing that expense base in both good times and tough times. Some ways, managing your expense base in tough times is easier than managing your expense base in good times where everybody wants to do need in different things. So -- but ultimately, we're comfortable that we've got growth momentum, and that will continue based upon the industries that we serve. No. It's a good question. So, Mark, do you want to take that? Next question, please. No. It's a good question. And I've been in the business for 40 years. Clients don't want to get involved in the paying the 27 underwriters who are on their account and some of those things are semiannual payments and some are even monthly or quarterly. It is an administrative complexity that clients have no interest in being part of. We take our fiduciary responsibilities very seriously. So, it's not like we can invest long on fiduciary assets. So, it's all the short end of the curve. But we would anticipate no pushback on getting some income -- some fiduciary income because the fact of the matter is, for a number of years, this has only been a one-way traffic in the direction of down. And so, there's been many years where we've done an awful lot of work around billings and payments in which there was very little or no compensation related to it. So, we're looking at this as a potentially large upside to us. Yeah. No. It's a very good question. And in some ways, the addressable market for ESG has not yet been determined. It's going to go wide. It's getting larger every year. And fundamentally, I think that every company from private or public midsize or larger is going out to demonstrate that they're a good company. And they demonstrate that in a multitude of different ways, but to -- with tight labor markets, that's the kind of company that people want to work for. Clients want to be associated with companies who are doing good work in the world. But I think it's an interesting question. I'd like to go around the horn a little bit and John can talk about it. And then maybe Martine and Nick can address it a little bit, because they're seeing a lot of ESG benefit in their results. But John? Thanks. So, you can see, Meyer, we're all over the ESG space and expect it to underpin our growth in future years. Next question, please. Yeah. It absolutely is, David. Ultimately, the way we run our business is -- one of the operative words that we use is more. We want to get better every year. We want to provide our clients with more capabilities with less internal costs. And so, our search for efficiency is a core part of this executive team's job and something that we're very focused on. And whether it's real estate, more purposeful travel and tech modernization, operational efficiency gains, the fact that we've got several new faces around the table and new faces come up with good ideas and fresh ideas. And there's lots of ways of running the business. And our goal over time is supporting our clients with a combination of really good comp and ben, because that makes us a strong company and helps us be an employer of choice in the industries that we operate. But always relentlessly going after all other expenses that have just fundamental aspects of running a multinational. So, this is a midterm and a long-term downward trend in our expense base in all other expenses. Next question -- or you have a follow-up, David? Yeah. I mean, I think, the way to look at it is, our revenue over the next several years should benefit from the organic hiring that we did last year. I mean, you look at it on the basis of -- last year, we had an opportunity to make significant organic investments in building our business. And it's something that we always focus on delivering good results today, but always focusing on the future and how we can build a better company. And this is an opportunity that John and I haven't seen in our careers in terms of being able to build the business on an organic basis. And so, we had the opportunity and we had the means, and last year's strong levels of organic growth helped provide those means and meant that we could still deliver good results to investors last year, while we were making these strong organic investments. You have to know that we all know around the table that organic investments are always short-term dilutive, and it's harder to do in some ways and acquisitions just by the P&L map, but we made the right decision and press forward. The vast majority of that expense is comp and ben. And the way I would look at it is we've got another two or three quarters and then the expense growth is going to be in the rearview mirror, but the capability and the growth kicker will remain. And so, this is a huge benefit to the overall organization. We're not going to quantify whether Henry and Sally are delivering today. I mean, we're a big organization. We've added to our market leading capabilities. We like where we are positioned right now in terms of the performance of some of that strategic hiring, and this is going to be a best with for us in coming years as well as this year. Sure. Next question, please. Sure. I'll start and then I'll hand to John. M&A is a big part of our organization and not just for the last decade, but literally since its inception. We don't have a budget around acquisitions. We're cautious when we make acquisitions. We like to cultivate relationships over long stretches of time. As has been commented in the marketplace before many times, over the last decade, multiples have risen. So, therefore, we're even more selective than we used to be and we're careful around pro formas, because most of the companies that we acquire are private. And we want to really understand the ongoing characteristics of the business and not some fancy dressed up pro forma statement. And so, the one thing that we're committed to is capital deployment. And so, we look at -- we favor share repurchase -- we favor acquisitions over share repurchase, but we certainly favor share repurchase over building more cash on the balance sheet. And so, we will utilize that circa $4 billion between the dividend, which is 7% and growing acquisitions and then share repurchase. But the M&A pipeline, ebbs and flows, it looks pretty good right now. But we don't really have -- we wouldn't at this stage to have a strong idea of where we would end up the year on that because many of the discussions we have are exclusive and the discussion is essentially the company decided whether they want to join forces with us or stay private. But John, do you want to talk about the pipeline, or how we're looking at M&A these days? Sure. John? Are you sneaking in two questions? Thanks. Martine? Perfect. Next question. Thanks. Sure. I mean, I think, we -- I used the resilience before, it's not just us. I think the world has gotten pretty resilient in that. We're not in 2020 anymore, and we've been able to adapt to different ways that have occurred in certain segments, whether that's in Europe, U.S., Asia, I mean, the one thing about COVID is no part of the world actually escaped. And so, we don't see a tremendous impact on our results from COVID. It would be more of a softer potential impact on just any headwind on GDP or business development. But other than that, we feel pretty good. I mean, you just look at Marsh's results as an example, in Asia-PAC in the quarter, it wasn't -- it's not COVID free. It was pretty active in Asia-PAC. So, in some ways, in terms of impact on our results, we think COVID is pretty much in the rearview mirror as well, knock wood. Thanks. So, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking to you next quarter and a particular shout out to all of our colleagues for their hard work and dedication in serving our clients. So, thank you very much."

            "name": "John Doyle",
            "content": "Thanks Dan and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results were strong. We had double-digit underlying revenue growth with all businesses positively contributing, and our adjusted operating in income hit a record level in the first quarter. Our strong star positions as well for 2022, despite greater uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook. Before I discuss market trends and our performance, I want to comment on our response to the crisis in Ukraine. As Dan noted, we condemned the Russian aggression and we are saddened by the human suffering the war in Ukraine has caused. Our primary concern is the wellbeing of colleagues affected by this crisis. We took a number of steps to assist them, including providing evacuation support for Ukrainian colleagues and creating assistance programs in Poland and Ukraine. In addition, we've established a humanitarian relief fund to help the Ukrainian people.  We're also bringing our capabilities and risk strategy and people to support clients as they grapple with the challenges of this conflict and its wider economic effects. Oliver Wyman is helping clients in the public and private sectors manage a wide scope of issues. We are working on government security in defense matters, helping a number of banks manage their exposure to the region, supporting energy clients with their supply chain considerations and assisting large manufacturers as they manage the risk of production shutdowns. Marsh is advising clients on risks around aircraft nationalization, cybersecurity, physical assets, supply chain, and transitioning away from Russian energy. Mercer is helping clients deal with capital market volatility, asset allocation and Russian exposures. We're also working to provide continued health coverage for Ukrainians leaving the country. Guy Carpenter is helping clients understand their exposures, portfolio concentrations and reinsurance recoveries. We're also advising clients on the complexities around sanctions and cause of loss, number of occurrences and claims aggregation. I'm extremely proud of how our firm has responded to this crisis. Overall, we are harnessing the power of Marsh McLennan to help our colleagues and our clients in this moment that matters. Now, let me provide an update on current P&C insurance market conditions. Rate increases in the marketplace continue to persist, reflecting losses and concerns about the impact of inflation on claims and the firm reinsurance market. The Marsh Global Insurance Market Index showed price increases of 11% year-over-year. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of rate increases in the commercial P&C insurance marketplace. Looking at pricing by line. The Marsh Market Index showed global property insurance was up 7% and global casualty rates were up mid single digits on average. Global financial and professional lines, excluding cyber, increased high single digits, while cyber rates more than doubled in some geographies. As a reminder, our index skews the large account business, however, small and middle market insurance rates continue to arise as well, although less than for large complex accounts. Turning to reinsurance April 1 renewals largely reflected a continuation of the January 1 pricing environment. The industry remains well capitalized, but finding capacity is challenging in specific segments. This reflects ongoing and emerging issues such as the frequency of severe events, cyber, climate change, and core and social inflation. Overall, at April 1, U.S. property catastrophe rates were up in the high single digits for non-loss impacted accounts. While loss impacted accounts generally increased in a range of 10% to 30%. U.S. cyber rates were up mid teens or higher depending on loss activity. Japanese property catastrophe rates increased low single digits. We remain focused on helping clients navigate challenging insurance and reinsurance markets, and the evolving risk environment. Turning to our performance in the quarter. As I noted earlier, Marsh McLennan had strong results. In the first quarter, we had double-digit underlying revenue growth in both RIS and consulting. Adjusted operating income grew 12% on top of 20% in the first quarter of 2021, a terrific result. The first quarter marks the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth, a longest stretch in over two decades. Looking at risk and insurance services. First quarter revenue was $3.5 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis. This is the third quarter in the last 12 months risk and insurance grew 10% or better, the best trend since 2003. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $1.2 billion, while our adjusted operating margin declined 10 basis points to 36.5% reflecting investments in the business. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago. Revenue growth was 11% on an underlying basis. We had excellent renewal growth and we continue to see strong new business. U.S. and Canada had 10% underlying revenue growth. This marks the U.S. and Canada's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth. International was also strong with underlying revenue growth of 11%. Asia-Pacific was up 17%. LATIN America grew 16% and EMEA was up 9%. Guy Carpenter's first quarter revenue was $1 billion up 11% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in new business and exceptional retention. Guy Carpenter has now achieved underlying revenue growth of over 10% three of the last four quarters. In the Consulting segment, revenue of $2 billion was a first quarter record, up 7% from a year ago or 10% on an underlying basis. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of 10% or higher growth. Adjusted operating increased 9% to a first quarter record of $402 million. The adjusted operating margin was 20.6%, up 10 basis points versus a year ago. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis, the fourth consecutive quarter of 6% or higher growth. Career grew 16% on an underlying basis. We continue to see robust demand for solutions linked to new ways of working, skills gaps, workforce transformation, and D&I issues like pay equity. Health underlying revenue growth was strong at 9% in the quarter, reflecting growth across all geographies. This quarter's results benefited from strong demand for our services, higher retention, rising employment and medical inflation. Wealth increased 2% on an underlying basis, reflecting modest growth in both investment management and defined benefits. Our assets under management were $388 billion at the end of the first quarter, down 7% sequentially as net inflows were more than offset by capital market declines. However, compared to the first quarter last year, AUM was up 2%. Oliver Wyman's momentum continued despite starting to lap tougher comparables to an outstanding 2021. Revenue in the first quarter was $667 million, an increase of 17% on an underlying basis. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth and reflects continued strong demand across all geographies. Overall, I'm pleased with our excellent first quarter performance and it sets us up for a good year. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mark for further detail on our financial results and a discussion of our outlook for the rest of 2022. Sure, Dan. Elyse, as I noted earlier, we're very pleased with our start to the year. Growth was strong pretty much across the board and I think you're referring to strat hires in RIS. But I want to note the growth in consulting was quite strong in the quarter as well as we're seeing good demand for our services across the board. We're pleased with the start in terms of the strat hire impact. As Dan noted, the impact was a little bit more notable in Guy Carpenter at this point. But it will take some time for them to become really fully accretive to our revenue expectations. It's a two to three-year period. So, our focus is on onboarding them as successfully as possible, but so far so good. The quarter really creates some good momentum for us. Obviously, there's a macroeconomic uncertainty given the war, given rising rates, supply chain issues, inflation, although I'd note inflation is generally a good thing for us on capital markets volatility, but we're well-positioned. As I said earlier, there's strong demand for our services, and we expect a good strong year of growth. Sure. Jimmy, as I noted in my prepared remarks, the insurance and reinsurance markets remain pretty challenging for our clients. Having said that, rate increases are decelerating and in at least most insurance markets around the world. Cyber, of course, is the most notable exception. For us, though, there is a mitigating impact of that rate deceleration around inflation and values. But let me ask Martin and Dean to comment a bit. Martin, maybe you could start, offer a bit more color on what's happening in the insurance market? Thanks, Martin. Dean? Thanks Dean. Just one quick last point, Jimmy. We continue to invest heavily in data and analytics, really help our clients navigate the market and make the trade-offs ever for them. So, it's a client-by-client outcome ultimately. Sure, Dan. Meyer, we're quite excited about our role here and the ability to impact clients and their future. And it's contributing positively to our growth now, but we're in the very early stages of what's possible here across all the businesses. Dan added some of the work that we're doing in his prepared remarks. But again, we're developing new solutions, new products and working with our clients every single day. We're part of the sustainable markets initiative overall as a company. So, we're excited about that. Nick, maybe I'll ask you to comment first. You're doing a lot of work, particularly around climate, around broader issues as well. Martine, maybe you could comment? Obviously, we see big demand in career services, but are also doing a lot of work in investments. Thank you, Martine. What's happening at Marsh? Terrific. Thank you. Dean, one last one? Thanks Dean. Sure. Good morning, Brian. We did three small deals in the quarter, one at Oliver Wyman, in Australia, one at M&A here, of course, in the United States, and then we did one at Mercer Marsh Benefits in France. So, we remain very active in the market. The pipeline, as Dan noted, is pretty solid. Generally speaking, the pipeline is deepest in the middle market brokerage space, and that's typically where we see some of our best and most attractive opportunities. But I would point out, we've done some more at Oliver Wyman, a lot of work at Oliver Wyman of late, not just in the quarter, but in the later part of last year. You may have seen that we recently announced that we expect to close on Booz Allen Hamilton's Middle Eastern business sometime in the second quarter. So, we'll see how the market evolves. Part of the dynamic here is our reputation as a buyer is very strong in these markets. And so, we get a good look at very attractive assets. Sure. Sure, Ryan. Yeah. We're pleased with our start in EMEA. We had good growth in the U.K. As we've shared in the past, for Continental Europe, the first quarter is a big part of the overall year. So, we're pleased to get off to a strong start. I think the one area that was probably notable on the RIS side is the impact of capital markets, the slowdown in M&A, the slowdown in IPOs. We began to see a bit of an impact as the quarter went on. But overall, demand again for our services remains quite strong and we feel good about how we're positioned all over the world, but in EMEA, in particular."

            "name": "Nick Studer",
            "content": "Yeah. John, thank you. Thank you, Meyer for the question. The  has been working, a great deal with companies across sectors to help plan for a smart climate transition along the lines that Dan described in his prepared comments. As you know, we largely work with the larger company, so I can't talk to the segmentation part of your question. But whether it's in financial services, supporting backhaul industry as they move to support their clients, or whether it's with some of the hard-to-abate sectors like steel, like some of the transportation sectors. We see an enormous amount of work on our climate and sustainability cracks more than doubled last year. It's as big as some of our significant industry practices already. Thank you, John. As exciting things going on in Marsh, we feel that a resilience index to have start  to see their progress on that business. We're testing hypotheses on clients about how a positive score can impact on their loss cost going forward in an initial study on D&O rates as mentioned in your remarks. It's showing that claims can be dispensed earlier and a lower outcome as companies seem to be doing good. We're testing that hypothesis in other areas of the business, other casualty lines that offset social inflation. And property as well where companies are investing heavily in social, in pollution protection and so forth, will make an impact there. We feel that we're going to back that up with the data strategy that we have and make a positive for our clients as they look ahead, and it's a good work for us too."

            "content": "Sure. Thank you, John. Well, as you noted, it's the 18th consecutive quarter of rate increases. So, clients are weary, that's the concern. But they decelerated as I noted in the -- the last call we had, they came down by two points in last quarter, another two points this quarter to -- land at 11%. Geographically, still as I noted last time, there's one outlier, which is Latin America, where they saw modest rate increases, but have been flatter during the rest of the cycle. By product across the board growth, casualty still strong at 4%, property up 7%. FinPro lines, which includes cyber, 26%. If you're stripping that out, that comes down and we're still seeing double-digit and doubling of rates in cyber, over 110% in the U.S. And the U.K. rates up 100%. So, there's a lot more concerned about that, but otherwise, as noted a mild deceleration."

        "speaker6": {
            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you, John and good morning. As Dan, John mentioned our financial performance in the first quarter marked a strong start to the year. We saw another great quarter of double-digit underlying revenue growth, meaningful earnings growth, despite tough expense comparison. We generated GAAP EPS of $2.10 in the quarter and adjusted EPS of $2.30 up 16% from a year ago. Operating income was $1.4 billion. And adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, a first quarter record. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 10 basis points in the first quarter to 29.7%, despite the impact of the significant organic investments we made last year. We remain excited about the benefits we expect from these investments, but they come with upfront costs we continue to absorb in the short term. The first quarter was also active -- an active quarter for capital management. We completed the highest quarterly level of share purchases since the third quarter of 2015. The pace of acquisition activity continues, with the recent announcement of our acquisition of Booz Allen Hamilton's MENA practice. And we announced an additional $5 billion share purchase authorization. John covered our business operating results. So, I'll cover some of the other aspects of our performance and outlook. Adjusted corporate expense was $60 million in the first quarter. Foreign exchange was a headwind of $0.04 to our adjusted EPS. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a modest headwind in the second quarter. Our other net benefit credit was $62 million in a quarter. For the full year 2022, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $250 million. Investment income was $26 million in the first quarter on a GAAP basis or $17 million on an adjusted basis, and mainly reflects gains in our private equity portfolio. Interest expense in the first quarter was $110 million compared to $118 million in the first quarter of 2021, reflecting lower long-term debt balances. Based on our current forecast, we expect a similar level of interest expense in the second quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.1% compared with 24.3% in the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discreet items, the largest of which was the accounting for share based compensation similar to a year ago. Excluding discreet items are effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume an adjusted effective tax rate of around 25% for 2022. In the first quarter, we recorded a $52 million charge, which is mostly non-cash relating to our exit from Russia. This has been treated as a noteworthy item and excluded from adjusted results. We reached an agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian business to local management who will operate independently in the Russian market. This situation resulted in the deconsolidation of our business and an associated write-down of our carrying value. In terms of ongoing impact, revenues and operating income from Russia are not significant. Turning to capital management. Now balance sheet. We entered the quarter with total debt of $11.7 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity isn't until March of 2023. In the first quarter, we repurchase 3.2 million shares of our stock for $500 million, reflecting our strong financial position and outlook for cash generation. We continue to expect to deploy approximately the $4 billion of capital in 2022 across dividends, acquisitions and share purchases. The ultimate level of share purchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develop. As we've consistently said, we favor attractive acquisitions over share purchases, as we view high quality acquisitions as the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long-term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time. And each year, we target raising our dividend and reducing our share count. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $772 million. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $813 million and included $272 million for dividends, $41 million for acquisitions and $500 million for share repurchases. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we see continued strong demand for our advice and solutions, even though we start to lap tougher growth comparisons in the second quarter. The investments we made in hiring last year will continue to be a headwind to expense in the first half, but as we get further into the third quarter, this becomes less of a drag. Also, we recognize there is a higher level of uncertainty and outlooks caused by the war in Ukraine and its potential impact on the global economy. Overall, our strong start leaves us well positioned for another good year in 2022. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver mid single digit or higher underlying growth, solid growth in adjusted EPS and margin expansion. And with that, I'm happy to turn the call back to Dan. Yeah. Yaron, good morning. That fiduciary interest income is certainly a source of upside for us and exactly how much and when -- when we see the benefit all depends on and when rates move. But the vast majority of that would just flow right through to the bottom line. In 2019, we had $105 million of interest income. Last year, it was $15 million and we've overcome that. These days, we're averaging about $10 million of fiduciary assets. So, if rates move across the world where our balances are, by 100 basis points, that's $100 million of upside. Sure. Good morning, Brian. So, I'd start by saying, if you look back over a long stretch of time, our track record on free cash flow growth has been terrific. With the last decade, we've generated double-digit free cash flow growth. And you expect that given our strong earnings and our outlook is -- for continued strong earnings growth and continued strong free cash flow growth. If you look back over that last decade though, you'd see a lot of volatility and you see that volatility just in the last couple of years. So, we generally would stay away from talking about predicting free cash flow in a given year, although we expect strong cash generation this year. Now as you pointed out, first quarters typically are low for cash generation, because we do pay out the majority of our variable comp in the first quarter. And the reduction this year was because our variable comp payouts were up. And that was mostly a function of the strong performance we had last year, both on new business growth and sales related plans as well as just the overall growth in earnings and the bonus plans that accrue from that."

            "name": "Martine Ferland",
            "content": "No. Absolutely John, and thanks for the question Meyer. We've been pioneering in ESG for many, many years now. First and foremost, the transition to the low-carbon economy. So, the investors or clients who work with us in managing their assets, they want to understand the transition to a lower net-zero emission economy and also the impact of, for example, the  they're making and their exposure to Russia, which falls under for them, their ESG policies. So, we're helping them, look at this and the consequences on oil supply, the energy strategy, et cetera. So, there's high demand for research, for advice, for modeling of the risk that are associated with that and the rewards of various investment strategies. And as you mentioned, John, of course, in the diversity, equity and inclusion domain, that's another place where we've been very active. We have many studies that help clients bridge the gender gap or the race and ethnicity gap. We do workforce analytics, we do pay equity. We have clients that build diverse workforces. And that's been such a tough of mine agenda item for our clients in the last couple of years. We just issued, as we said in the opening remarks, a stepping up for equity study where we work with 50 clients to identify the techniques, the strategies that you can employ for employers to really help close the gap on opportunities for Black Americans. And there's a G in the ESG, and that's also been always on our agenda. When you think about the work we do for executive compensation, DB and DC, the pension fund governance advice, our OCIO business is very much depend on different governance model that gives agility and integrity to the investment. So, that's really top of mind of our clients and its business that's been growing really fast over the last few years. Yeah. Thank you, Ryan. Well, first, you asked about discretionary project, and I would say, no. This is not -- there's no cycle to this. It's pretty much through the year. It's big project that clients work with us. And there's still lots of demand for these projects. So, of course, we always keep an eye on the outlook. In terms of potential recession, as we know, this is the discretionary projects are a little bit more sensitive to that than other parts of the business. But so far, so good. The demand is really strong. And we see the immediate, a very strong outlook for the year. And you just think about the solutions that we're solving through with our clients in the discretionary projects, whether they are the future of work or -- and there's a link here to your question on the volatility on the wealth business, because when there's uncertainty clients need us to do more modeling or more planning around the investments in the pension plan. So, the bottom line is it's not seasonal. And just to complete the thought on your question on the wealth side, of course, the capital markets have been creating some headwinds on the short-term basis or part of the business that's linked to our assets under management. We call it the outsourced Chief Investment Officer business, OCIO. It's a fantastic business. It's given us many, many years of strong growth. We have strong flows. But, of course, on the short-term, as this business grows in proportion to our portfolio, we will maybe see a little bit more volatility there, but we're able to manage that in the grand scheme of the firm. And we've done so this quarter, because it has been negatively impacted since the beginning of the year. The other thing -- the other end on this, and you've alluded to that in your question is the -- first of all, the AUM portfolio, our assets are diversified. So, there's some risk management in that equity fixed income alternatives. In the long run, it will grow. It's also that this business now is larger than our traditional DB business. And therefore, over the long run, we also see that as a tailwind. And the market volatilities just creates demand for stronger governance, better agility and moving assets from one to the next. And you'll see this as interest rates go up and the pension funding gets better. You'll see clients wanted to secure that and start shifting assets to fixed income and also provides them more opportunity to think of derisking that side of the business, which has been a trend for many years now."

Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements.

During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nJohn Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, head of Investor Relations.  2023 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. Total revenue grew 10% to $22.7 billion. We generated 9% underlying revenue growth, continuing our best period of growth in more than two decades, with each of our businesses delivering strong results. Adjusted operating income grew 17% to $5.6 billion. This on top of 11% growth in 2022. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points, marking the 16th consecutive year we've reported margin expansion, and adjusted EPS grew 17%. We invested $1.6 billion in acquisitions that added to our talent, capabilities, and scale. This was our largest year for acquisitions in nearly two decades, aside from 2019 when we acquired JLT. Our acquisition of Graham expanded MMA\u2019s mid-Atlantic presence, Honan\u2019s strength in our Australian middle market business, and our transaction with Westpac created one of Australia's most competitive super funds. At the same time, we continued to optimize our portfolio, with the sale of two administration businesses at Mercer, which closed on January 1, 2024, and we delivered significant capital return to shareholders, raising our dividend by 20%, and completing $1.15 billion of share repurchases. I'm proud of what our team achieved in 2023. Our colleagues executed on key initiatives and generated value for clients and shareholders.  Our performance reflects execution of a well-defined strategy, which includes building a culture that attracts and retains top talent, strengthening our capabilities through organic and inorganic investment, positioning ourselves in segments and geographies with attractive growth and margin profiles, leveraging data insights and innovation to support clients in managing uncertainty and finding new opportunities, and delivering the power of Marsh McLennan\u2019s perspective to help clients thrive. I just returned from the World Economic Forum where geopolitical, economic, climate, technology, and social risks were all very much top of mind for business and government leaders. Marsh McLennan is uniquely positioned to help clients manage the broad range of outcomes they're confronting from these issues. The launch of the Unity facility with Ukraine in November is a great example. Marsh, Oliver Wyman, and Guy Carpenter, came together to create an innovative insurance solution through a public-private partnership. Unity is now providing access to affordable war risk insurance for grain shipments in the Black Sea. The Ukrainian government's ambition is for the facility to enable nearly 1,000 shipments annually, helping to support their economy and global food security. Launching this facility was a proud moment for us, and I can't think of a better example of our purpose, our capabilities, and our impact in action. In so many ways, Marsh McLennan is well positioned to address today's challenges, and we are only just beginning to harness our combined capabilities, which are a distinct advantage. We are inspired by the possibilities, and consider it a privilege to do this important work. Our business strategy is complemented by a balanced approach to expense and capital management. We focus on generating consistent, strong earnings growth, and have a discipline of growing revenue faster than expenses. Our approach to capital allocation delivers results today, while investing to sustain growth in the future. And we are implementing new ways to operate, reduce complexity, and organize for impact. The strong value propositions of our individual businesses, the upside from bringing our collective strength to clients, and our restructuring actions, position us well for 2024. Looking to the year ahead, we continue to see a complex macro environment. Major economies continue to face the risk of recession, but moderating inflation and the possibility of easing interest rates make a soft landing more likely. The geopolitical situation remains unsettled, with multiple wars, escalating conflict throughout the Middle East, and rising tension in the South China Sea. Despite these challenges, we continue to believe there are factors that are supportive of growth in our business. Nominal GDP expectations for 2024 remain healthy for our major markets. While inflation has moderated, it is still elevated, and tight labor markets and supply chain challenges persist. Continued low unemployment and sustained payroll growth, support demand in health and benefits and exposure unit growth in workers' compensation. The cost of risk continues to increase as insurers account for rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, the risks of social inflation, and higher reinsurance costs. Healthcare costs, driven in part by the rising cost of prescription drugs, accelerated in 2023, and are expected to remain elevated. And while short-term interest rates could ease, they remain at the highest level since the financial crisis. As we've stated before, we have a track record of resilience and performance across economic cycles. Now, let me turn to insurance and reinsurance market conditions. Primary insurance rates increased for the 25th consecutive quarter, with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 2% overall, compared to a 3% increase in the third quarter. Property rates increased 6% versus 7% in the third quarter, and casualty pricing continued to be up low single-digits. Workers' compensation decreased slightly, while financial and professional liability rates were down mid-single-digits. Cyber pricing decreased modestly after several years of increases. In reinsurance, the January 1 renewals reflected a market with more balanced trading conditions than a year ago. As we expected, underwriting discipline continued, but the market was more responsive to client objectives. Capacity was generally adequate, and we saw increased demand from clients. In global property cat reinsurance, accounts without losses saw rates up modestly, while loss-impacted accounts increase between 10% and 30%. Casualty programs faced more scrutiny this year, with pressure on pro-rata seating commissions, and excess of loss pricing. However, casualty capacity was adequate. As always, we're helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions.  Now, let me briefly turn to our fourth quarter financial performance, which Mark will cover in detail. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.68, which is up 14% versus a year ago. Revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis, with 8% growth in RIS, and 7% in consulting. Overall, in the fourth quarter, we had adjusted operating income growth of 16%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points year-over-year. In summary, 2023 was another outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. All of our businesses delivered, generating excellent revenue and earnings growth. We executed on our strategic initiatives, invested in high quality acquisitions, made the largest dividend increase in 25 years, and made meaningful share repurchases. Looking forward, we are well positioned for 2024. We expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong adjusted EPS growth. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, meaningful uncertainty remains, and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions.  With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our strong fourth quarter results capped an excellent year. Our consolidated revenue increased 11% in the fourth quarter to $5.6 billion, with underlying growth of 7%. Operating income was $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, up 16% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 23.3%. GAAP EPS was $1.52. Adjusted EPS was $1.68, up 14%. Our full year of 2023 results were outstanding. Operating income for the year was $5.3 billion, and adjusted operating income was $5.6 billion, an increase of 17% over 2022. Adjusted EPS grew 17% to $7.99, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points, marking our 16th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. 2023 was also a strong year for capital management. We deployed $4 billion of capital, enhanced our short-term liquidity, raised our quarterly dividend 20%, and saw Moody's upgrade our senior unsecured debt rating to A3.  Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue increased 11% to $3.3 billion, or 8% on an underlying basis. This result marks the 11th consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS, and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. RIS operating income was $753 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to $791 million, and our adjusted margin expanded 140 basis points to 27%. For the full year, revenue in RIS was $14.1 billion, representing an increase of 11% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 17% for the year, and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 150 basis points to 31.3%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter increased 7% to $2.9 billion, or 6% on an underlying basis. For the full year, revenue at Marsh was $11.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 8%. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 5% for the quarter, reflecting solid renewal and new business growth, despite continued headwinds in financial and professional lines. We also saw a headwind of nearly a point from lower flood claims in our MGA business.  For the full year, underlying growth in US and Canada was strong at 7%. In international, underlying growth was 7% in the quarter, with Latin America up 11%, Asia Pacific up 10%, and EMEA up 5%. For the full year, underlying growth in international was excellent at 9%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $252 million, up 9% on an underlying basis, driven by growth across global specialties in most regions. For the year, Guy Carpenter generated $2.3 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth, our strongest year since 2003. In the consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% from a year ago, or 7% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $443 million, and adjusted operating income was $480 million, up 18%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points in the quarter to 21.3%. For the full year, consulting revenue was $8.7 billion, an increase of 7% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 13% to $1.7 billion, and our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 20.4%.  Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting underlying growth of 5%. This was Mercer's 11th straight quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth, and continues the best run of growth in 15 years. Health grew 9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting strength in employer and government segments, and momentum across all regions. Wealth was up 4%, driven by growth and investment management and DB administration. Our assets under management were $420 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 11% sequentially, and up 22% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transaction with Westpac, a rebound in capital markets, and positive net flows. Career revenue increased 1%, reflecting tough comparables following a period of strong growth in the reward space. For the year, revenue at Mercer was $5.6 billion, an increase of 7% on an underlying basis, the best result since 2008. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was 856 million, an increase of 9% on an underlying basis, like strength in Europe and the Middle East. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $3.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 8%.  Adjusted corporate expense was $78 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had very little impact on earnings in the fourth quarter and was a $0.07 headwind for the full year. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX will have a negligible impact on the first quarter and full year of 2024. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $90 million, the majority of which related to our restructuring actions, partly offset by a $58 million gain related to a legal settlement. We reported $131 million of total restructuring costs, approximately $113 million of which relates to the program we launched in the fourth quarter of 2022. These charges largely reflect costs related to severance, lease exits, and streamlining our technology environment. We expect total charges under this program of approximately $475 million, and expect total savings of roughly $400 million, of which approximately $230 million was realized in 2023. We expect to realize the bulk of the remaining savings in 2024. To date, we've incurred approximately $440 million of charges under this program. Our other net benefit credit was $59 million in the quarter and $239 million for the full year. For 2024, we currently expect our other net benefit credit will be up slightly. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $111 million in 2023. We expect a similar amount in 2024. Investment income was a loss of $1 million in the fourth quarter on both a GAAP and adjusted basis, and we aren't currently projecting any investment income in the first quarter of 2024.  Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $151 million, up from $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense for the full year 2024 of approximately $625 million, with $159 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 25.5%. This compares with 22.9% in the fourth quarter last year, which benefited from favorable discrete items. For the full year 2023, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, compared with 23.5% in 2022. Both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25.5% and 26.5% for 2024. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $13.5 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturities are in the first quarter of 2024, when $1 billion of senior notes mature, and in the second quarter when another $600 million of notes come due. Recall that last September we issued $1.6 billion of new debt to fund these maturities. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.1 billion, and included $354 million for dividends, $486 million for acquisitions, and $250 million for share repurchases. For the year, uses of cash totaled $4 billion and included $1.3 billion for dividends, $1.6 billion for acquisitions, and $1.15 billion for share repurchases.  I want to take a minute to reiterate our approach to capital management. We have consistently followed a balanced capital management strategy that helps us deliver solid performance in the near term, while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We prioritize investment in our business, both through organic investments and acquisitions. We favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases, and believe they are the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time, and each year we target raising our dividend and reducing our share cap.  Looking ahead to 2024, based on our outlook today, we expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As John noted, there is significant uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy. However, we feel good about our momentum and position, and despite the uncertainty, there are factors that remain supportive of growth. For 2024, we currently expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS.  With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John. \nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we're ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, earlier this week, we had another insurance broker who's updating their reported EPS metric to back out intangibles. So, that does leave you guys as the only broker peer, right, that doesn't back out intangibles out of your adjusted EPS figure. Have you guys given consideration to moving towards what's become industry common practice?\nJohn Doyle: Good morning, Elyse. Mark, maybe you could comment on that. \nMark McGivney: Elyse, we don't have any current plans to change our reporting. We do provide amortization and other information that allows you to stack us up against other companies, but we don't plan to change how we report at this point.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks.\nJohn Doyle: You have a follow-up, Elyse?\nElyse Greenspan: And then my second - yes, my second question. I was hoping to get more color on both the US and Canada and EMEA, which did see growth slow in the quarter. I know Mark alluded to one point headwind from lower flood business within the US and Canada. I wasn't sure if there was anything else to point out in the quarter, and also hoping to get similar color on anything one-off within organic growth within EMEA as well.\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Elyse, and I'll make a couple of comments and then ask Martin to jump in. First of all, Marsh had an excellent year of growth at 8% underlying revenue growth for the year, a strong finish to the year. We saw fourth quarter of 2022 have slightly lower underlying growth as well, but we feel like we're very well positioned. Mark made a few comments about the growth in the quarter, but Martin, maybe you could add a little bit more color.\nMartin South: Yes, thank you, John. As you said, we had a very good year, with 7% growth this year. And Marsh for the quarter at 5% growth, was also the same as the prior year. MMA had an outstanding performance, driven really by great retention new business. Our M&A pipeline is robust. The US business continued to perform well. There's some headwinds in the capital markets activity and pressure on financial minds, but our advisory business grow - it was partially offset by Canada, which is impacted more by macro headwinds. And of course, we mentioned a lot of flood claims in the MGA business. So, in EMEA, we had an excellent year in EMEA, 9% growth. Q4 was 5% growth. The European business within EMEA is the smallest quarter by some margin. And so, it's susceptible to some slowdown in some of the projects, but we had a very strong year, strong quarter in the Middle East, steady results in the UK. And so, that was really it. Nothing remarkable, strong momentum, we'd expect to be very confident going into next year.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Martin. So, Elyse, FINPRO pricing, as Mark mentioned, flood claims and the continued slow M&A environment, all factored in in the US, but again, we feel like we're very well positioned and demand is quite strong for us in in 2024. Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. So, first, just a question on the reinsurance brokerage business. Obviously, prices this year haven't gone up like they did last year. But what have you seen in terms of terms and conditions and buying behavior? Because last year we saw the primaries retain a lot of risk and attachment points went up. Have those come back down or are like sort of terms and structures programs similar to how they were last year?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks for the question, Jimmy. Guy Carpenter just had an excellent year helping clients navigate what was a very, very choppy market in 2023. We certainly began 2024 with a more orderly market, but growth was outstanding, and I feel terrific about how we're positioned to help clients going forward. But Dean, maybe could share a little bit more insight on the market on 1/1.\nDean Klisura: Sure. Thanks, John. And Jimmy, let me give you a little bit more color on the 1/1 renewal in reinsurance. As John stated, we saw a balanced reinsurance market at the January 1st renewal. Overall capacity was adequate for the completion of most programs across products and classes of business. Capacity did increase given rebounding capital in the marketplace and improved reinsurer returns in 2023. We estimate the dedicated reinsurance capital increased double-digit for the 1/1 renewal. Turning to property cat, which I think you're mainly referring to, as John noted, was more consistent trading rhythm than last year. Capacity overall was adequate to cover most non-frequency cat exposed layers. But as John noted, reinsurers held firm on terms and conditions. Attachment points did not come down. So, reinsurers held on what they achieved in 2023, continuing to expose our clients' balance sheets to attritional volatility moving forward. So, that certainly didn't change. But overall, I thought it was a positive renewal. Clients bought more capacity at the top of cat programs. You saw some of those reported in the marketplace. So, clients were able to get more capacity than last year, achieve their objectives, as John noted. John talked about risk-adjusted rate increases. For clients with non-loss impacted portfolios, they saw a range of flat to high single-digit kind of rate increases, but clients with cat losses were in the 10% to 30% rate increase range, right? So, I think that was pretty robust in both kind of the US and European markets. Maybe a minute on casualty as well. In prior calls, we talked a lot about casualty and increased scrutiny of casualty portfolios heading into the 1/1 renewal. Reinsurers have been expressing concerns about adverse loss development now for several quarters and real and social inflation. However, I would say that at 1/1, that pricing movement was more constrained, slightly more muted than we anticipated kind of earlier in the fourth quarter. That said, as John, as John mentioned, there was downward pressure on seating commissions for quota share contracts. And excess of lost contracts saw double-digit rate increases moving forward. But in the casualty renewal, I would say overall capacity was adequate.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Dean. Jimmy, I would add, just in both the insurance and reinsurance market, the pace of loss cost inflation in casualty is the great unknown at the moment. We all know it's increasing. We all see mounting evidence of it, but that's the challenge for all of us in the market to sort through at the moment. Do you have a follow-up, Jimmy?\nJimmy Bhullar: Yes. Just on fiduciary investment income. So, it had been increasing at a pretty sharp rate and declined modestly sequentially. Is that a function of just what's happened with interest rates or something to do with fiduciary balances or seasonality or something else?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Mark, you want to? \nMark McGivney: Yes. Jimmy, it is seasonality. Our balances tend to have a pattern of seasonality. It results in - Q4 and Q1 tend to be seasonal lows for average balances. So, it's purely a function of that.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Jimmy. Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\nMichaelZaremski: Good morning. Back to the organic growth commentary, especially on the brokerage side, you\u2019re loud and clear on kind of some of the pluses and minuses. I didn't hear anything about any influence from maybe a diminishing tailwind from some of the excess hires you've made in past years. Is that a dynamic we should be thinking about as we think about 2024 and 2025?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Mike. No, I don't think so. We continue to invest both organically and inorganically, maybe not that at the pace of a few years ago, but that's an important metric for us that we track around how we're driving production capacity in all of our businesses. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we think the macro environment continues to be supportive of growth in our business. Nominal GDP will drive some growth. Inflation, while easing, is still elevated, tight labor markets. We were just talking about the cost of risk in casualty as well. And as a result of that, we think pricing in the market will maintain - will remain relatively stable as it's been really throughout most of 2023. So, we\u2019re quite optimistic about 2024. Our outlook is positive. I would also say a couple of other things. We're a better business entering 2024. We've been working hard at that. Our mix continues to improve. I talked about that a little bit about some of the divestiture activity, but also the inorganic investment we made. And we'll continue to invest organically in the business as well, and demand remains strong. So, we're excited about 2024.\nMichaelZaremski: Understood. And my follow-up, switching gears a little bit to Mercer. In your prepared remarks, I think you made, John, some comments about medical or health inflation. Some of the data points we've seen are - the medical costs for employers should - might accelerate in 2024. Should that have a tailwind or any influence on the health segment specifically? Thanks.\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Health was a terrific story for us in 2023, and helping employers navigate what's a very, very complex and increasing cost environment will be very much on the top of our agenda in 2024 as well. Maybe, Martine, I'll ask you to comment a little bit about how we finished the year and what your outlook is around health for 2024.\nMartine Ferland: Yes. Thanks, John, and thanks, Mike, for the question. We're very pleased with the results in health, and we have had a quarter of 9% a year of 10 in overall health, and it comes from all regions, and it comes from many places. Of course, full employment does drive good results there, more people to cover in our employers\u2019 benefit programs. But we also have invested in innovative and adaptive solutions. And medical cost inflation is there, and what it drives for us is a lot of consulting around trying to help clients and their employees control costs by better design, better fit for purpose programs. So, we'll see. There's not a huge portion of our business that is actually directly linked to inflation. We have a lot of fee-based revenue in the business. So, usually, whether there's a lot of inflation or inflation abates a little bit is not a big factor in the overall results. I think it's more around access to healthcare, innovative form of healthcare, like digital health, mental health, good affordability for clients and their employees. That's mostly driving our business results.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Martine. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. I had a question just on Oliver Wyman, and I know a few quarters ago, we spoke about the pipeline that had slowed a little bit, but growth has remained pretty resilient there. I'm wondering if you could just talk about some of the drivers there within Oliver Wyman for organic. And we've seen a few more - a little bit more activity on the life insurance transaction side, just M&A activity. Is that something that's been an outside driver to results?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, David. Oliver Wyman had a terrific year, and as we all recall, we had a flat start to 2023. So, demand continued to pick up and sales continued to pick up throughout the course of the year, and we had a real strong finish. But Nick, maybe you could share a bit more color on what drove the growth and your outlook a bit.\nNick Studer: Thank you, David, for the question. Yes, 12 months ago, we were coming off a pretty strong year, but we knew the first quarter was going to be tough. And looking back on the year, it was indeed a pretty tough marketplace for many of our competitors and for the industry, and we're very proud of clawing back from that slow start to a strong year. It was pretty wide-based growth. As Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, our Middle East business grew very strongly, had excellent growth in Europe. We had strong growth in our economic research capabilities, as well as in digital, in finance and risk. Some of our other capabilities grew, our people and organizational performance capability. And I've mentioned a few times that we've been building a restructuring practice. It's still not a big restructuring cycle, but that practice continues to grow very strongly. And across the industry is, again, broad-based growth in the public sector, which is a strong practice for us, particularly in the Middle East. Some good growth in banking. You mentioned life insurance and consolidation. We have a strong insurance practice. We've seen a lot more activity in post-merger integration and M&A across our sectors. And then our transportation and services and our communications media and technology practices also grew strongly. And I think it's off the base of just good hiring, good organic growth, and also some good inorganic growth. We've made a number of acquisitions over the last few years. We announced one which we hope to complete in the next couple of months, and both great partner level hires and M&A are helping fuel that growth as well. So, the business is now 50% bigger than it was three years ago. That scale, that breadth, allows us to play in more places, allows us to help our clients with their big transformative moments.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Nick. And David, I would add, Oliver Wyman is just one of the ways in which we can show up in a very, very different way in front of clients and prospects. And so, we have a unique collection of capabilities, certainly with them and the family. Do you have a follow-up, David?\nDavid Motemaden: I do, yes. Thanks for that. Just a bigger picture question. I just sort of look over the last decade or the decade pre-pandemic, Marsh as an enterprise has grown organically in the 3% to 5% range, and we've obviously been well above that over the last three years, including 9% here in 2023. There've been a number of tailwinds, but you guys have also been investing in the business. So, I'm wondering if you think we can sustainably grow above that 3% to 5% organic growth we saw in the decade pre-pandemic as we think about the next several years.\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, David. As I said just a couple of minutes ago, I think we're a better business entering 2024 than we were in 2023. I thought we were an outstanding business leading into 2023, but we've been working hard at being a better growth business for many years now. Part of that's reshaping the mix of business. As we've talked about, investing organically and inorganically. We've spent a lot of time refining our client engagement models and investing in sales operations and technology to support sales. And of course, in 2019, we made the biggest acquisition in our history with JLT. So, we were building up these capabilities going into 2020 when, of course, the pandemic hit. So, I knew we were ready to run coming out of the pandemic. The macro environment, of course, has been supportive since the pandemic. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect the macros to continue to be supportive in in 2024. So, we think we're well positioned. As I mentioned earlier, we expect mid single-digit revenue growth or better. So, we're excited and quite optimistic heading into the year. Operator, next question, please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. So, just curious if you could give us some more color on any changes in the middle market operating environment in particular, and anything you guys are thinking about in terms of competitive dynamics as some large peers enter this space in a bigger way.\nJohn Doyle: I think you could ask Aon about NFP. I'm happy to talk about our middle market offering. I believe we have the best-in-class middle market US platform in MMA. It has been 12 years that we've been building our business here in the United States. And we've been building it out methodically and I\u2019m very, very proud of it. We love competition. And so, I'll take our team in the market, but we're excited about our prospects at MMA. And candidly, I think we're just getting started. And when we began this effort 12 years ago, there were 30,000 independent agents in the United States, and today there are 30,000 independent agents in the United States. So, there's much more in front of us. Do you have a follow-up? \nRobert Cox: That's great. Yes. So, just for a follow-up, maybe going back to the health space, I think you guys have discussed how you're largely compensated on a fee per employee basis, and employment growth is much lower than the 9% organic you achieved in the quarter. So, I was just wondering if you could help me understand, is this more consulting, new business opportunities out there? Are you raising fees and maybe is brokerage growing at a similar pace to the headline 9% organic?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. it's I think all of the above, but good sales and a value proposition to clients and prospects that they appreciate very much. I don't know, Martine, do you have anything to add to that? \nMartine Ferland: Yes. Well, first a correction. The large part of our business is actually consulting fees. It's not fees per member, as you mentioned, Robert. So, just to be clear about that. There's a small portion of the business in the US that is fee per participant, but that's the business that we divested. It's more in a (NIM) business. It\u2019s how those businesses are usually paid out. So, the bulk of our business, some of it is based on the commission, but as I said, clients are really trying to control costs. So, there's not a direct link to inflation in premium there, because they would change the attachment point, as my colleagues in reinsurance like to talk about. They would vary the benefit programs, et cetera. And there's a large part that is project-based. And to your point, our growth has been in part full employment because there's much more work to be done to cover the employee population. But there's also a lot of change. High cost of prescription drugs, for example, accessibility through different means, technology coming into the space to help out people choose the right providers, the right programs, and we're there with them helping them design those programs, communicate them to employees, measure them in terms of efficacy, but also cost, et cetera. So, that's what's been - and you know that the health space everywhere is also seeing lots of change, lots of pressure on cost. So, I don't see us being not busy anytime soon. Nothing climbs through that.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Martine. Thank you, Robert. Andrew, next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Great, thank you. Two quick questions. First, can you give us a sense of the seasonality of the reinsurance acquisition that contributed so much to this quarter's growth?\nJohn Doyle: Mark, maybe you can?\nMark McGivney: Meyer, what you're seeing - I think you're referring to the underlying growth schedule and what looks like a large acquisition in Guy Carpenter, is actually that column is acquisitions, dispositions, and other adjustments. And we had a - in my prepared remarks, I mentioned a legal settlement that we had, a noteworthy item in the quarter. So, that's what's running through that schedule. It wasn't a large - not M&A for Guy Carpenter.\nMeyer Shields: Oh, okay. Thank you.\nJohn Doyle: You have a follow-up, Meyer?\nMeyer Shields: Yes, a quick one. When you've got the flood claims revenues in last year's I guess US and Canada operations with risk and insurance services, did that have any impact on last year's margins or the year-over-year progress?\nJohn Doyle: Well, we don't report margins by business, but you saw a good margin expansion during the course of the year. And again, our outlook for 2024 is for 17th year in a row to expand margins yet again. So, it wasn't material. We managed through it. There are parts of our business that are lumpy, right? That's why we caution everybody not to get too worked up about growth rates in a particular quarter. And the flood claim activity was largely related to Hurricane Ian-related work that we did at that time last year. Thank you, Meyer. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Hey, thanks, John. Just quickly and kind of following on Rob's question a little bit. If we look at the middle market space, there are some kind of larger competitors of yours that are going through some transitions, be it being acquired, maybe being acquired, not sure, all sorts of stuff. Is that creating maybe another opportunity here for you to kind of ramp up talent acquisition? You obviously were really successful a couple of years ago doing that. Is that opportunity out there you think again?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Look, Brian, what I would say first and foremost about talent acquisition is that we are very, very focused. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks about building a culture that attracts and retains the best in our work. The way we frame it, and we talk about being at your best at Marsh McLennan, right? How can we - for those that want to commit their career to risk strategy and people-related work, how is it that being at Marsh McLennan, you can be your best? And we frame those programs around learning and development, mobility, various aspects of wellness. And you get to do really purposeful work here. I mentioned the Ukraine work as an example earlier. You get to work with exceptional talent, and it's a collaborative environment and a learning environment. And so, I feel like we have the best talent in our business. I feel like our brand as an employer in the market is very, very strong. It doesn't mean everybody wants to work here. Of course, we're a big company and as we all know, there's lots of things that come with working at a bigger company. But I like how we're positioned. So, M&A, yes. Does it create opportunities for talent acquisition? Much like - we saw a bit of talent breakage when we acquired JLT. Folks sign up for working at a certain place, and when you have that kind of change, it's an opportunity possibly for folks to think through what they want to do going forward. I like how we're positioned in that respect. And then back to your other comment, yes, there are a number of bigger businesses, particularly in the risk space that are likely to change hands over time.\nBrian Meredith: Great, thanks. And then I guess my next question, could you talk a little bit about kind of the M&A environment, particularly in the risk business, multiples being paid, what the pipeline kind of looks like there, more competitive, less competitive.\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, Brian. We remain very active in the market. As I said earlier, last year was our biggest year of acquisitions, other than 2019 when we did JLT, over a long period of time. We're very selective. We\u2019re looking for high performing businesses, well led businesses in attractive markets. As I mentioned, we want growth businesses with the ability to grow earnings as well. The three bigger deals that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we're very excited about Honan in Australia. It gives us really an anchor platform deeper into the middle market in what's a very important and attractive market for us. Graham here in the United States, another step forward for us at MMA and then BT Westpac in Australia, strengthening our wealth business. So, we have a couple of deals that we announced in the later part of last year. Vanguard's OCIO operation, a career business, those will close sometime over the next the next few months. So, we're going to continue to be active. Much like I was talking about our brand as an employer, our brand as a buyer is also quite strong, right? We do what we say we're going to do. And so - and then on valuations, four really attractive assets. Their multiples remain high. And so, anyway, but we'll continue to deploy capital that way. And as Mark mentioned, we'd rather deploy capital on attractive inorganic and organic investment for that matter over share buybacks. But in the course of a year, you never know how things will run. But the pipeline is quite strong at the moment. Thank you, Brian. Andrew, next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. John, you talked about the great unknown in terms of loss cost inflation, social inflation. On the flip side, we've seen a few carriers report, and their results have been exceptional. So, I understand that you're kind of projecting out some good pricing, but at what point does that give and take ratio change and we kind of see some softer pricing, and how would that affect Marsh?\nJohn Doyle: So, look, as I've said a couple of times on this call, we've been working very hard at becoming a better growth business. We're not an index on P&C pricing. Of course, we're exposed to it. And just to be clear, I wasn't trying to project higher casualty prices over time. Our job is to get the most efficient risk financing as we can for our clients. But what I can tell you is, it is quite clear that there's stress emerging in casualty. There's no question about it. There are some casualty cats that are out there that are concerning to underwriters and buyers, and we're just seeing greater frequency of mega settlements, and for that matter, even judgements on individual cases. Core inflation, of course, is something that's always a factor in the market. And you see that - you've seen some of that manifest itself in shorter tail lines from carriers. But we're all quite concerned inside of our risk business about where casualty loss costs are headed.\nAndrew Kligerman: Thanks for that one. And then my second question is just the stellar growth, underlying growth in Asia Pacific at 10%, LATAM at 11% in risk and insurance services. Question is, what particularly you seeing in those markets that is driving some of that excellent growth? And then underlying that, what is Marsh doing differently from the competitors?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. I mean, we're very proud of our businesses in both of those regions. They've been growth leaders for us over the last several years. I would point out, it's one of the things that JLT brought to us in 2019. We expanded our footprint and brought along much greater distribution in both Latin America and Asia. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit more about both of those regions.\nMartin South: Yes, as you say, I mean, we\u2019re the clear market leader by some margin in Asia-Pac. There's several factors. We have literally market leadership in every single major geography there. We are able to bring all of our best capabilities from around the world to there. We have great teams, very specialized, a very strong employee benefits business. We have scale. We're able to attract and retain talent in a way - there's just - there's real momentum there. And the same can be said in Latin America. Slightly different economic dynamics, obviously, with Latin America. A big protection gap. A lot of opportunities market leadership in the areas there, and still quite an unconsolidated marketplace. So, we like the fact that we built our businesses organically, so the cultures are strong. There's not much on the M&A pipeline in those markets that we like. We are confident that we can build our businesses organically. And the differentiation of having global service and our global capabilities is really well sought out to by our clients.\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, Andrew, and Martin, for that. We continue to be excited about how we're positioned in those markets. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley.\nBob Huang: Hi. I only have one major question. So, this regarding MMA. So, just curious, how much did MMA contribute to the overall revenue for 2023? And as we move into 2024, how should we think about the trajectory for MMA? Is it like, should we continue to expect it to further outgrow the broader business as a whole, or how should we think about just the competitive dynamic overall as well?\nJohn Doyle: So, we obviously don't separately report MMA's results, but it's an important part of our business in the United States, and it continues to perform exceptionally well. We couldn't be more pleased, as I mentioned earlier. And as I also said, I think we're just getting started, right? So, and what I would also say is that the broader Marsh has learned a great deal from MMA about what it takes to win in the middle market. And Martin and the team apply those lessons as we expand in the middle market all over the world and where possible even deploy inorganic investment like we did in in the case of Honan in Australia. But our business at MMA also benefits from being part of Marsh. They're excellent at really mining Marsh for content and capability that can enable them to show up with scale in local markets in a way that really distinguishes themselves from others. So, as I mentioned earlier, we've been methodically building out MMA over the course of the last 12 years piece by piece and A+ asset by A+ asset. And so, we couldn't be more excited, and we think there's a long road ahead of us. Do you have a follow-up, Bob? \nBob Huang: No, I think I'm good. Thank you.\nJohn Doyle: Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please.\nOperator: One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi.\nMichael Ward: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Just on the capital deployment target, I think it was up over 10%. I was just wondering if that's a function of the cost savings program rolling off or anything else.\nJohn Doyle: No, but Mark, maybe you could just talk generally about our approach.\nMark McGivney: We had a, if you saw, a strong year of free cash flow generation. We have significant financial flexibility. Our balance sheet is strong. And so, it's just really a reflection of the growth in our outlook for capital - cash generation.\nMichael Ward: Okay. And then any kind of update on the progress with synergizing the various business sales efforts together?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, Mike, for that question. One of the things that I think makes us a better business is we're working better together than we ever have, right? And we have shared with you where we are on the expense side of things, but we're showing up together in front of clients and prospects. As I mentioned earlier, the strength of our individual business propositions will continue to drive the growth of our business overall. But more and more, we can show up in a very, very unique way. And so, we made good progress during 2023. We've certainly learned a great deal. We've done some testing, and we'll continue to refine that. But we have a number of global growth opportunities where we're showing up in front of clients and prospects together. And what we really did was create a framework for our folks in the field. As you'll recall, we appointed Marsh McLennan leaders in each of the regions. And so, a big part of their day is making sure that we're bringing our collective capabilities to market at a local level where it makes sense. So, we continue to be excited about what that'll mean to future growth.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan, for any closing remarks.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Andrew, and I want to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.",

            "name": "Dean Klisura",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, John. And Jimmy, let me give you a little bit more color on the 1/1 renewal in reinsurance. As John stated, we saw a balanced reinsurance market at the January 1st renewal. Overall capacity was adequate for the completion of most programs across products and classes of business. Capacity did increase given rebounding capital in the marketplace and improved reinsurer returns in 2023. We estimate the dedicated reinsurance capital increased double-digit for the 1/1 renewal. Turning to property cat, which I think you're mainly referring to, as John noted, was more consistent trading rhythm than last year. Capacity overall was adequate to cover most non-frequency cat exposed layers. But as John noted, reinsurers held firm on terms and conditions. Attachment points did not come down. So, reinsurers held on what they achieved in 2023, continuing to expose our clients' balance sheets to attritional volatility moving forward. So, that certainly didn't change. But overall, I thought it was a positive renewal. Clients bought more capacity at the top of cat programs. You saw some of those reported in the marketplace. So, clients were able to get more capacity than last year, achieve their objectives, as John noted. John talked about risk-adjusted rate increases. For clients with non-loss impacted portfolios, they saw a range of flat to high single-digit kind of rate increases, but clients with cat losses were in the 10% to 30% rate increase range, right? So, I think that was pretty robust in both kind of the US and European markets. Maybe a minute on casualty as well. In prior calls, we talked a lot about casualty and increased scrutiny of casualty portfolios heading into the 1/1 renewal. Reinsurers have been expressing concerns about adverse loss development now for several quarters and real and social inflation. However, I would say that at 1/1, that pricing movement was more constrained, slightly more muted than we anticipated kind of earlier in the fourth quarter. That said, as John, as John mentioned, there was downward pressure on seating commissions for quota share contracts. And excess of lost contracts saw double-digit rate increases moving forward. But in the casualty renewal, I would say overall capacity was adequate."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Doyle",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call today is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, head of Investor Relations.  2023 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. Total revenue grew 10% to $22.7 billion. We generated 9% underlying revenue growth, continuing our best period of growth in more than two decades, with each of our businesses delivering strong results. Adjusted operating income grew 17% to $5.6 billion. This on top of 11% growth in 2022. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points, marking the 16th consecutive year we've reported margin expansion, and adjusted EPS grew 17%. We invested $1.6 billion in acquisitions that added to our talent, capabilities, and scale. This was our largest year for acquisitions in nearly two decades, aside from 2019 when we acquired JLT. Our acquisition of Graham expanded MMA's mid-Atlantic presence, Honan's strength in our Australian middle market business, and our transaction with Westpac created one of Australia's most competitive super funds. At the same time, we continued to optimize our portfolio, with the sale of two administration businesses at Mercer, which closed on January 1, 2024, and we delivered significant capital return to shareholders, raising our dividend by 20%, and completing $1.15 billion of share repurchases. I'm proud of what our team achieved in 2023. Our colleagues executed on key initiatives and generated value for clients and shareholders.  Our performance reflects execution of a well-defined strategy, which includes building a culture that attracts and retains top talent, strengthening our capabilities through organic and inorganic investment, positioning ourselves in segments and geographies with attractive growth and margin profiles, leveraging data insights and innovation to support clients in managing uncertainty and finding new opportunities, and delivering the power of Marsh McLennan's perspective to help clients thrive. I just returned from the World Economic Forum where geopolitical, economic, climate, technology, and social risks were all very much top of mind for business and government leaders. Marsh McLennan is uniquely positioned to help clients manage the broad range of outcomes they're confronting from these issues. The launch of the Unity facility with Ukraine in November is a great example. Marsh, Oliver Wyman, and Guy Carpenter, came together to create an innovative insurance solution through a public-private partnership. Unity is now providing access to affordable war risk insurance for grain shipments in the Black Sea. The Ukrainian government's ambition is for the facility to enable nearly 1,000 shipments annually, helping to support their economy and global food security. Launching this facility was a proud moment for us, and I can't think of a better example of our purpose, our capabilities, and our impact in action. In so many ways, Marsh McLennan is well positioned to address today's challenges, and we are only just beginning to harness our combined capabilities, which are a distinct advantage. We are inspired by the possibilities, and consider it a privilege to do this important work. Our business strategy is complemented by a balanced approach to expense and capital management. We focus on generating consistent, strong earnings growth, and have a discipline of growing revenue faster than expenses. Our approach to capital allocation delivers results today, while investing to sustain growth in the future. And we are implementing new ways to operate, reduce complexity, and organize for impact. The strong value propositions of our individual businesses, the upside from bringing our collective strength to clients, and our restructuring actions, position us well for 2024. Looking to the year ahead, we continue to see a complex macro environment. Major economies continue to face the risk of recession, but moderating inflation and the possibility of easing interest rates make a soft landing more likely. The geopolitical situation remains unsettled, with multiple wars, escalating conflict throughout the Middle East, and rising tension in the South China Sea. Despite these challenges, we continue to believe there are factors that are supportive of growth in our business. Nominal GDP expectations for 2024 remain healthy for our major markets. While inflation has moderated, it is still elevated, and tight labor markets and supply chain challenges persist. Continued low unemployment and sustained payroll growth, support demand in health and benefits and exposure unit growth in workers' compensation. The cost of risk continues to increase as insurers account for rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, the risks of social inflation, and higher reinsurance costs. Healthcare costs, driven in part by the rising cost of prescription drugs, accelerated in 2023, and are expected to remain elevated. And while short-term interest rates could ease, they remain at the highest level since the financial crisis. As we've stated before, we have a track record of resilience and performance across economic cycles. Now, let me turn to insurance and reinsurance market conditions. Primary insurance rates increased for the 25th consecutive quarter, with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 2% overall, compared to a 3% increase in the third quarter. Property rates increased 6% versus 7% in the third quarter, and casualty pricing continued to be up low single-digits. Workers' compensation decreased slightly, while financial and professional liability rates were down mid-single-digits. Cyber pricing decreased modestly after several years of increases. In reinsurance, the January 1 renewals reflected a market with more balanced trading conditions than a year ago. As we expected, underwriting discipline continued, but the market was more responsive to client objectives. Capacity was generally adequate, and we saw increased demand from clients. In global property cat reinsurance, accounts without losses saw rates up modestly, while loss-impacted accounts increase between 10% and 30%. Casualty programs faced more scrutiny this year, with pressure on pro-rata seating commissions, and excess of loss pricing. However, casualty capacity was adequate. As always, we're helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions.  Now, let me briefly turn to our fourth quarter financial performance, which Mark will cover in detail. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.68, which is up 14% versus a year ago. Revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis, with 8% growth in RIS, and 7% in consulting. Overall, in the fourth quarter, we had adjusted operating income growth of 16%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points year-over-year. In summary, 2023 was another outstanding year for Marsh McLennan. All of our businesses delivered, generating excellent revenue and earnings growth. We executed on our strategic initiatives, invested in high quality acquisitions, made the largest dividend increase in 25 years, and made meaningful share repurchases. Looking forward, we are well positioned for 2024. We expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong adjusted EPS growth. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, meaningful uncertainty remains, and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions.  With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we're ready to begin Q&A. Good morning, Elyse. Mark, maybe you could comment on that. You have a follow-up, Elyse? Sure, Elyse, and I'll make a couple of comments and then ask Martin to jump in. First of all, Marsh had an excellent year of growth at 8% underlying revenue growth for the year, a strong finish to the year. We saw fourth quarter of 2022 have slightly lower underlying growth as well, but we feel like we're very well positioned. Mark made a few comments about the growth in the quarter, but Martin, maybe you could add a little bit more color. Thanks, Martin. So, Elyse, FINPRO pricing, as Mark mentioned, flood claims and the continued slow M&A environment, all factored in in the US, but again, we feel like we're very well positioned and demand is quite strong for us in in 2024. Operator, next question. Yes, thanks for the question, Jimmy. Guy Carpenter just had an excellent year helping clients navigate what was a very, very choppy market in 2023. We certainly began 2024 with a more orderly market, but growth was outstanding, and I feel terrific about how we're positioned to help clients going forward. But Dean, maybe could share a little bit more insight on the market on 1/1. Thanks, Dean. Jimmy, I would add, just in both the insurance and reinsurance market, the pace of loss cost inflation in casualty is the great unknown at the moment. We all know it's increasing. We all see mounting evidence of it, but that's the challenge for all of us in the market to sort through at the moment. Do you have a follow-up, Jimmy? Sure. Mark, you want to? Thanks, Jimmy. Operator, next question, please. Yes. Thanks, Mike. No, I don't think so. We continue to invest both organically and inorganically, maybe not that at the pace of a few years ago, but that's an important metric for us that we track around how we're driving production capacity in all of our businesses. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we think the macro environment continues to be supportive of growth in our business. Nominal GDP will drive some growth. Inflation, while easing, is still elevated, tight labor markets. We were just talking about the cost of risk in casualty as well. And as a result of that, we think pricing in the market will maintain - will remain relatively stable as it's been really throughout most of 2023. So, we're quite optimistic about 2024. Our outlook is positive. I would also say a couple of other things. We're a better business entering 2024. We've been working hard at that. Our mix continues to improve. I talked about that a little bit about some of the divestiture activity, but also the inorganic investment we made. And we'll continue to invest organically in the business as well, and demand remains strong. So, we're excited about 2024. Sure. Health was a terrific story for us in 2023, and helping employers navigate what's a very, very complex and increasing cost environment will be very much on the top of our agenda in 2024 as well. Maybe, Martine, I'll ask you to comment a little bit about how we finished the year and what your outlook is around health for 2024. Thanks, Martine. Andrew, next question, please. Yes, thanks, David. Oliver Wyman had a terrific year, and as we all recall, we had a flat start to 2023. So, demand continued to pick up and sales continued to pick up throughout the course of the year, and we had a real strong finish. But Nick, maybe you could share a bit more color on what drove the growth and your outlook a bit. Thank you, Nick. And David, I would add, Oliver Wyman is just one of the ways in which we can show up in a very, very different way in front of clients and prospects. And so, we have a unique collection of capabilities, certainly with them and the family. Do you have a follow-up, David? Yes, thanks, David. As I said just a couple of minutes ago, I think we're a better business entering 2024 than we were in 2023. I thought we were an outstanding business leading into 2023, but we've been working hard at being a better growth business for many years now. Part of that's reshaping the mix of business. As we've talked about, investing organically and inorganically. We've spent a lot of time refining our client engagement models and investing in sales operations and technology to support sales. And of course, in 2019, we made the biggest acquisition in our history with JLT. So, we were building up these capabilities going into 2020 when, of course, the pandemic hit. So, I knew we were ready to run coming out of the pandemic. The macro environment, of course, has been supportive since the pandemic. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect the macros to continue to be supportive in in 2024. So, we think we're well positioned. As I mentioned earlier, we expect mid single-digit revenue growth or better. So, we're excited and quite optimistic heading into the year. Operator, next question, please. I think you could ask Aon about NFP. I'm happy to talk about our middle market offering. I believe we have the best-in-class middle market US platform in MMA. It has been 12 years that we've been building our business here in the United States. And we've been building it out methodically and I'm very, very proud of it. We love competition. And so, I'll take our team in the market, but we're excited about our prospects at MMA. And candidly, I think we're just getting started. And when we began this effort 12 years ago, there were 30,000 independent agents in the United States, and today there are 30,000 independent agents in the United States. So, there's much more in front of us. Do you have a follow-up? Yes. it's I think all of the above, but good sales and a value proposition to clients and prospects that they appreciate very much. I don't know, Martine, do you have anything to add to that? Thank you, Martine. Thank you, Robert. Andrew, next question please. Mark, maybe you can? You have a follow-up, Meyer? Well, we don't report margins by business, but you saw a good margin expansion during the course of the year. And again, our outlook for 2024 is for 17th year in a row to expand margins yet again. So, it wasn't material. We managed through it. There are parts of our business that are lumpy, right? That's why we caution everybody not to get too worked up about growth rates in a particular quarter. And the flood claim activity was largely related to Hurricane Ian-related work that we did at that time last year. Thank you, Meyer. Andrew, next question, please. Yes. Look, Brian, what I would say first and foremost about talent acquisition is that we are very, very focused. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks about building a culture that attracts and retains the best in our work. The way we frame it, and we talk about being at your best at Marsh McLennan, right? How can we - for those that want to commit their career to risk strategy and people-related work, how is it that being at Marsh McLennan, you can be your best? And we frame those programs around learning and development, mobility, various aspects of wellness. And you get to do really purposeful work here. I mentioned the Ukraine work as an example earlier. You get to work with exceptional talent, and it's a collaborative environment and a learning environment. And so, I feel like we have the best talent in our business. I feel like our brand as an employer in the market is very, very strong. It doesn't mean everybody wants to work here. Of course, we're a big company and as we all know, there's lots of things that come with working at a bigger company. But I like how we're positioned. So, M&A, yes. Does it create opportunities for talent acquisition? Much like - we saw a bit of talent breakage when we acquired JLT. Folks sign up for working at a certain place, and when you have that kind of change, it's an opportunity possibly for folks to think through what they want to do going forward. I like how we're positioned in that respect. And then back to your other comment, yes, there are a number of bigger businesses, particularly in the risk space that are likely to change hands over time. Yes, thanks, Brian. We remain very active in the market. As I said earlier, last year was our biggest year of acquisitions, other than 2019 when we did JLT, over a long period of time. We're very selective. We're looking for high performing businesses, well led businesses in attractive markets. As I mentioned, we want growth businesses with the ability to grow earnings as well. The three bigger deals that I highlighted in my prepared remarks, we're very excited about Honan in Australia. It gives us really an anchor platform deeper into the middle market in what's a very important and attractive market for us. Graham here in the United States, another step forward for us at MMA and then BT Westpac in Australia, strengthening our wealth business. So, we have a couple of deals that we announced in the later part of last year. Vanguard's OCIO operation, a career business, those will close sometime over the next the next few months. So, we're going to continue to be active. Much like I was talking about our brand as an employer, our brand as a buyer is also quite strong, right? We do what we say we're going to do. And so - and then on valuations, four really attractive assets. Their multiples remain high. And so, anyway, but we'll continue to deploy capital that way. And as Mark mentioned, we'd rather deploy capital on attractive inorganic and organic investment for that matter over share buybacks. But in the course of a year, you never know how things will run. But the pipeline is quite strong at the moment. Thank you, Brian. Andrew, next question. So, look, as I've said a couple of times on this call, we've been working very hard at becoming a better growth business. We're not an index on P&C pricing. Of course, we're exposed to it. And just to be clear, I wasn't trying to project higher casualty prices over time. Our job is to get the most efficient risk financing as we can for our clients. But what I can tell you is, it is quite clear that there's stress emerging in casualty. There's no question about it. There are some casualty cats that are out there that are concerning to underwriters and buyers, and we're just seeing greater frequency of mega settlements, and for that matter, even judgements on individual cases. Core inflation, of course, is something that's always a factor in the market. And you see that - you've seen some of that manifest itself in shorter tail lines from carriers. But we're all quite concerned inside of our risk business about where casualty loss costs are headed. Yes. I mean, we're very proud of our businesses in both of those regions. They've been growth leaders for us over the last several years. I would point out, it's one of the things that JLT brought to us in 2019. We expanded our footprint and brought along much greater distribution in both Latin America and Asia. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit more about both of those regions. Yes, thanks, Andrew, and Martin, for that. We continue to be excited about how we're positioned in those markets. Andrew, next question, please. So, we obviously don't separately report MMA's results, but it's an important part of our business in the United States, and it continues to perform exceptionally well. We couldn't be more pleased, as I mentioned earlier. And as I also said, I think we're just getting started, right? So, and what I would also say is that the broader Marsh has learned a great deal from MMA about what it takes to win in the middle market. And Martin and the team apply those lessons as we expand in the middle market all over the world and where possible even deploy inorganic investment like we did in in the case of Honan in Australia. But our business at MMA also benefits from being part of Marsh. They're excellent at really mining Marsh for content and capability that can enable them to show up with scale in local markets in a way that really distinguishes themselves from others. So, as I mentioned earlier, we've been methodically building out MMA over the course of the last 12 years piece by piece and A+ asset by A+ asset. And so, we couldn't be more excited, and we think there's a long road ahead of us. Do you have a follow-up, Bob? Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please. No, but Mark, maybe you could just talk generally about our approach. Yes, thanks, Mike, for that question. One of the things that I think makes us a better business is we're working better together than we ever have, right? And we have shared with you where we are on the expense side of things, but we're showing up together in front of clients and prospects. As I mentioned earlier, the strength of our individual business propositions will continue to drive the growth of our business overall. But more and more, we can show up in a very, very unique way. And so, we made good progress during 2023. We've certainly learned a great deal. We've done some testing, and we'll continue to refine that. But we have a number of global growth opportunities where we're showing up in front of clients and prospects together. And what we really did was create a framework for our folks in the field. As you'll recall, we appointed Marsh McLennan leaders in each of the regions. And so, a big part of their day is making sure that we're bringing our collective capabilities to market at a local level where it makes sense. So, we continue to be excited about what that'll mean to future growth. Thanks, Andrew, and I want to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, David, for the question. Yes, 12 months ago, we were coming off a pretty strong year, but we knew the first quarter was going to be tough. And looking back on the year, it was indeed a pretty tough marketplace for many of our competitors and for the industry, and we're very proud of clawing back from that slow start to a strong year. It was pretty wide-based growth. As Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, our Middle East business grew very strongly, had excellent growth in Europe. We had strong growth in our economic research capabilities, as well as in digital, in finance and risk. Some of our other capabilities grew, our people and organizational performance capability. And I've mentioned a few times that we've been building a restructuring practice. It's still not a big restructuring cycle, but that practice continues to grow very strongly. And across the industry is, again, broad-based growth in the public sector, which is a strong practice for us, particularly in the Middle East. Some good growth in banking. You mentioned life insurance and consolidation. We have a strong insurance practice. We've seen a lot more activity in post-merger integration and M&A across our sectors. And then our transportation and services and our communications media and technology practices also grew strongly. And I think it's off the base of just good hiring, good organic growth, and also some good inorganic growth. We've made a number of acquisitions over the last few years. We announced one which we hope to complete in the next couple of months, and both great partner level hires and M&A are helping fuel that growth as well. So, the business is now 50% bigger than it was three years ago. That scale, that breadth, allows us to play in more places, allows us to help our clients with their big transformative moments."

            "name": "Martin South",
            "content": "Yes, thank you, John. As you said, we had a very good year, with 7% growth this year. And Marsh for the quarter at 5% growth, was also the same as the prior year. MMA had an outstanding performance, driven really by great retention new business. Our M&A pipeline is robust. The US business continued to perform well. There's some headwinds in the capital markets activity and pressure on financial minds, but our advisory business grow - it was partially offset by Canada, which is impacted more by macro headwinds. And of course, we mentioned a lot of flood claims in the MGA business. So, in EMEA, we had an excellent year in EMEA, 9% growth. Q4 was 5% growth. The European business within EMEA is the smallest quarter by some margin. And so, it's susceptible to some slowdown in some of the projects, but we had a very strong year, strong quarter in the Middle East, steady results in the UK. And so, that was really it. Nothing remarkable, strong momentum, we'd expect to be very confident going into next year. Yes, as you say, I mean, we're the clear market leader by some margin in Asia-Pac. There's several factors. We have literally market leadership in every single major geography there. We are able to bring all of our best capabilities from around the world to there. We have great teams, very specialized, a very strong employee benefits business. We have scale. We're able to attract and retain talent in a way - there's just - there's real momentum there. And the same can be said in Latin America. Slightly different economic dynamics, obviously, with Latin America. A big protection gap. A lot of opportunities market leadership in the areas there, and still quite an unconsolidated marketplace. So, we like the fact that we built our businesses organically, so the cultures are strong. There's not much on the M&A pipeline in those markets that we like. We are confident that we can build our businesses organically. And the differentiation of having global service and our global capabilities is really well sought out to by our clients."

            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning. Our strong fourth quarter results capped an excellent year. Our consolidated revenue increased 11% in the fourth quarter to $5.6 billion, with underlying growth of 7%. Operating income was $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, up 16% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 23.3%. GAAP EPS was $1.52. Adjusted EPS was $1.68, up 14%. Our full year of 2023 results were outstanding. Operating income for the year was $5.3 billion, and adjusted operating income was $5.6 billion, an increase of 17% over 2022. Adjusted EPS grew 17% to $7.99, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points, marking our 16th consecutive year of reported margin expansion. 2023 was also a strong year for capital management. We deployed $4 billion of capital, enhanced our short-term liquidity, raised our quarterly dividend 20%, and saw Moody's upgrade our senior unsecured debt rating to A3.  Looking at risk and insurance services, fourth quarter revenue increased 11% to $3.3 billion, or 8% on an underlying basis. This result marks the 11th consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS, and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. RIS operating income was $753 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to $791 million, and our adjusted margin expanded 140 basis points to 27%. For the full year, revenue in RIS was $14.1 billion, representing an increase of 11% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 17% for the year, and our adjusted operating margin in RIS increased 150 basis points to 31.3%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter increased 7% to $2.9 billion, or 6% on an underlying basis. For the full year, revenue at Marsh was $11.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 8%. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 5% for the quarter, reflecting solid renewal and new business growth, despite continued headwinds in financial and professional lines. We also saw a headwind of nearly a point from lower flood claims in our MGA business.  For the full year, underlying growth in US and Canada was strong at 7%. In international, underlying growth was 7% in the quarter, with Latin America up 11%, Asia Pacific up 10%, and EMEA up 5%. For the full year, underlying growth in international was excellent at 9%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $252 million, up 9% on an underlying basis, driven by growth across global specialties in most regions. For the year, Guy Carpenter generated $2.3 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth, our strongest year since 2003. In the consulting segment, fourth quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10% from a year ago, or 7% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $443 million, and adjusted operating income was $480 million, up 18%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points in the quarter to 21.3%. For the full year, consulting revenue was $8.7 billion, an increase of 7% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income for the year increased 13% to $1.7 billion, and our adjusted operating margin increased 70 basis points to 20.4%.  Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting underlying growth of 5%. This was Mercer's 11th straight quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth, and continues the best run of growth in 15 years. Health grew 9% in the fourth quarter, reflecting strength in employer and government segments, and momentum across all regions. Wealth was up 4%, driven by growth and investment management and DB administration. Our assets under management were $420 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, up 11% sequentially, and up 22% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transaction with Westpac, a rebound in capital markets, and positive net flows. Career revenue increased 1%, reflecting tough comparables following a period of strong growth in the reward space. For the year, revenue at Mercer was $5.6 billion, an increase of 7% on an underlying basis, the best result since 2008. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the fourth quarter was 856 million, an increase of 9% on an underlying basis, like strength in Europe and the Middle East. For the full year, Oliver Wyman's revenue was $3.1 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 8%.  Adjusted corporate expense was $78 million in the quarter. Foreign exchange had very little impact on earnings in the fourth quarter and was a $0.07 headwind for the full year. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX will have a negligible impact on the first quarter and full year of 2024. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $90 million, the majority of which related to our restructuring actions, partly offset by a $58 million gain related to a legal settlement. We reported $131 million of total restructuring costs, approximately $113 million of which relates to the program we launched in the fourth quarter of 2022. These charges largely reflect costs related to severance, lease exits, and streamlining our technology environment. We expect total charges under this program of approximately $475 million, and expect total savings of roughly $400 million, of which approximately $230 million was realized in 2023. We expect to realize the bulk of the remaining savings in 2024. To date, we've incurred approximately $440 million of charges under this program. Our other net benefit credit was $59 million in the quarter and $239 million for the full year. For 2024, we currently expect our other net benefit credit will be up slightly. Cash contributions to our global defined benefit plans were $111 million in 2023. We expect a similar amount in 2024. Investment income was a loss of $1 million in the fourth quarter on both a GAAP and adjusted basis, and we aren't currently projecting any investment income in the first quarter of 2024.  Interest expense in the fourth quarter was $151 million, up from $127 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect interest expense for the full year 2024 of approximately $625 million, with $159 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 25.5%. This compares with 22.9% in the fourth quarter last year, which benefited from favorable discrete items. For the full year 2023, our adjusted effective tax rate was 24%, compared with 23.5% in 2022. Both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25.5% and 26.5% for 2024. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the year with total debt of $13.5 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturities are in the first quarter of 2024, when $1 billion of senior notes mature, and in the second quarter when another $600 million of notes come due. Recall that last September we issued $1.6 billion of new debt to fund these maturities. Our cash position at the end of the fourth quarter was $3.4 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.1 billion, and included $354 million for dividends, $486 million for acquisitions, and $250 million for share repurchases. For the year, uses of cash totaled $4 billion and included $1.3 billion for dividends, $1.6 billion for acquisitions, and $1.15 billion for share repurchases.  I want to take a minute to reiterate our approach to capital management. We have consistently followed a balanced capital management strategy that helps us deliver solid performance in the near term, while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We prioritize investment in our business, both through organic investments and acquisitions. We favor attractive acquisitions over share repurchases, and believe they are the better value creator for shareholders and the company over the long term. However, we also recognize that returning capital to shareholders generates meaningful returns for investors over time, and each year we target raising our dividend and reducing our share cap.  Looking ahead to 2024, based on our outlook today, we expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. As John noted, there is significant uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy. However, we feel good about our momentum and position, and despite the uncertainty, there are factors that remain supportive of growth. For 2024, we currently expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS.  With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John. Elyse, we don't have any current plans to change our reporting. We do provide amortization and other information that allows you to stack us up against other companies, but we don't plan to change how we report at this point. Yes. Jimmy, it is seasonality. Our balances tend to have a pattern of seasonality. It results in - Q4 and Q1 tend to be seasonal lows for average balances. So, it's purely a function of that. Meyer, what you're seeing - I think you're referring to the underlying growth schedule and what looks like a large acquisition in Guy Carpenter, is actually that column is acquisitions, dispositions, and other adjustments. And we had a - in my prepared remarks, I mentioned a legal settlement that we had, a noteworthy item in the quarter. So, that's what's running through that schedule. It wasn't a large - not M&A for Guy Carpenter. We had a, if you saw, a strong year of free cash flow generation. We have significant financial flexibility. Our balance sheet is strong. And so, it's just really a reflection of the growth in our outlook for capital - cash generation."

            "name": "Martine Ferland",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks, John, and thanks, Mike, for the question. We're very pleased with the results in health, and we have had a quarter of 9% a year of 10 in overall health, and it comes from all regions, and it comes from many places. Of course, full employment does drive good results there, more people to cover in our employers' benefit programs. But we also have invested in innovative and adaptive solutions. And medical cost inflation is there, and what it drives for us is a lot of consulting around trying to help clients and their employees control costs by better design, better fit for purpose programs. So, we'll see. There's not a huge portion of our business that is actually directly linked to inflation. We have a lot of fee-based revenue in the business. So, usually, whether there's a lot of inflation or inflation abates a little bit is not a big factor in the overall results. I think it's more around access to healthcare, innovative form of healthcare, like digital health, mental health, good affordability for clients and their employees. That's mostly driving our business results. Yes. Well, first a correction. The large part of our business is actually consulting fees. It's not fees per member, as you mentioned, Robert. So, just to be clear about that. There's a small portion of the business in the US that is fee per participant, but that's the business that we divested. It's more in a (NIM) business. It's how those businesses are usually paid out. So, the bulk of our business, some of it is based on the commission, but as I said, clients are really trying to control costs. So, there's not a direct link to inflation in premium there, because they would change the attachment point, as my colleagues in reinsurance like to talk about. They would vary the benefit programs, et cetera. And there's a large part that is project-based. And to your point, our growth has been in part full employment because there's much more work to be done to cover the employee population. But there's also a lot of change. High cost of prescription drugs, for example, accessibility through different means, technology coming into the space to help out people choose the right providers, the right programs, and we're there with them helping them design those programs, communicate them to employees, measure them in terms of efficacy, but also cost, et cetera. So, that's what's been - and you know that the health space everywhere is also seeing lots of change, lots of pressure on cost. So, I don't see us being not busy anytime soon. Nothing climbs through that."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's earnings conference call. Today's call is being recorded. Third Quarter 2023 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nJohn Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President, and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Before I get into our results, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the violent attacks on Israel and the tragic events unfolding in Israel and Gaza. We, along with our colleagues, condemn all acts of terror and violence and reject hatred. Our primary focus is on ensuring the safety and well-being of our colleagues in Tel Aviv and supporting colleagues around the world who have family and friends in Israel and Gaza. We're also supporting our clients as they grapple with the challenges of this conflict. Turning to our third quarter results. I'm very pleased with our performance. We extended our best run of quarterly underlying revenue growth in over two decades and reported significant growth in adjusted EPS. Top-line momentum continued with 10% underlying revenue growth, on top of 8% growth in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted operating income grew 24% versus a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted EPS grew 33%, and we completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter. These results reflect our consistent focus on delivering in the near term, while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We are seeing the benefit of investments we've made in our talent and capabilities, and we continue to see opportunities to add high-quality acquisitions. During the third quarter, we announced two significant transactions. In early August, Marsh McLennan Agency acquired Graham Company, a top 100 U.S. insurance and benefits broker and risk management consultancy with 215 employees and over $70 million in revenue. Graham will provide significant business insurance and employee benefits expertise for MMA's clients in the Mid-Atlantic. This acquisition is another example of us attracting the best agencies in the U.S. MMA is now a $3 billion revenue business. In the same month, Marsh announced an agreement to acquire Honan Insurance Group. This deal expands our Australian middle market business and our position across the Pacific region and Asia. Honan specializes in corporate risk and employee benefits and serves over 30,000 clients. Beyond acquisitions, we continue to make targeted investments in talent, sales operations, and go-to-market strategies. We are also investing in new technologies and solutions to bring the best of Marsh McLennan to our clients. For example, Guy Carpenter recently launched the next generation of our catastrophe analytics platform, GC Advantage Point. The new platform is a critical tool to help clients drive profitable risk selection and manage catastrophe exposure in a quickly evolving risk landscape. Earlier this year, Marsh announced the launch of Cyber Pathway, an integrated cybersecurity and insurance solution for U.S. small and midsized businesses that helps enhance the resilience in a volatile threat environment. The program provides access to key security tools and capabilities as well as insurance coverage that can grow as our clients evolve. And we are investing in technologies that enhance our internal productivity, insights for clients and improve colleague experience. One example is LenAI, Marsh McLennan's internal AI assistant. LenAI offers the power of ChatGPT in a safe and data-secure environment and is available to all colleagues. Developed by our innovation center, it's also helping Oliver Wyman support clients in developing their own AI capabilities. Our approach to balancing investment and growth drives consistent exceptional performance for shareholders and positions us well to deliver new solutions and insights for our clients. Turning to our strategic initiatives. The combined value proposition of our businesses continues to gain traction with clients, especially in certain industries and lines of business. For example, we are focused on enterprise risks for healthcare clients. Our Marsh and Mercer teams are coming together to respond to emerging challenges, such as health and safety, labor actions, and workforce and liability risks from AI. In the private equity and M&A space, Mercer, Marsh, and Oliver Wyman are combining capabilities to help client\u2019s close deals and create post-transaction value. This can include due diligence, advisory on large transformations, health and benefits carve-out transactions, and providing stop-loss solutions. And in the insurance sector, Guy Carpenter is partnering with Mercer to provide portfolio management solutions to insurance clients. One example is our advanced balance sheet solution, which is a collaborative approach that aligns risk and return across an insurer's balance sheet. This offering has already resulted in several regional insurers choosing to partner with Mercer for OCIO. We are also finding new ways to operate, reduce complexity, and organize for impact. As we continue to execute on our restructuring actions, we've identified additional opportunities to rationalize technology, reduce our real estate footprint, and realign our workforce. We now expect to achieve total savings of roughly $400 million by 2024, with total cost to achieve these savings of $425 million to $475 million. Overall, the momentum we are seeing as our businesses increasingly serve clients together, combined with our restructuring efforts, offers opportunities to deliver enhanced value for clients, drive higher growth, and be more efficient and connected. Now let me turn to the macro environment. The outlook remains uncertain. Capital market volatility has returned with the continued rise in interest rates. The trajectory of inflation and further central bank tightening remain an open question and the geopolitical situation remains volatile. Despite the environment, we continue to perform well, and we have a track record of resilience. We believe we are well positioned to perform across economic cycles and manage our business to grow revenues faster than expenses in good as well as challenging periods. Now let me turn to insurance and reinsurance market conditions. Primary insurance rates continue to increase with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 3% overall, in line with the second quarter. Property rates increased 7% compared to 10% in the second quarter. Casualty pricing was up in the low single-digit range. Workers' compensation increased slightly, while financial and professional liability insurance rates were down mid-single digits. Cyber insurance pricing decreased modestly after several years of increases. In reinsurance, our clients have faced consistent challenges throughout 2023. This includes elevated cat losses, core and social inflation, and continued political instability. As we look to January 1, the market appears to be more orderly than last year, but we expect underwriting discipline to continue. On the property side, we expect firm pricing, but a more stable market with adequate capacity and increased reinsurer appetite. In casualty, the market is more cautious with reinsurers assessing prior year loss development and inflation. We expect capacity to remain stable. Overall, clients will need thorough preparation and a proactive strategy to achieve desired outcomes. We are well-positioned to help our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.57, which is up 33% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 10%. Underlying revenue grew 11% in RIS and 9% in Consulting. Marsh was up 8%, Guy Carpenter 8%, Mercer 8%, and Oliver Wyman grew 12%. Overall, the third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 24% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points year-over-year. For the nine months, consolidated revenue grew 10% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 17% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $6.31, up 17% from a year ago. With our outstanding results in the third quarter and year-to-date, we remain on track for a terrific year. Based on our outlook today and assuming current market conditions persist, we now expect full-year underlying revenue growth to be 9% to 10%. We also continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Finally, I want to provide an update on our recently announced leadership changes. Martine Ferland, CEO of Mercer, will retire on March 31 of next year. Pat Tomlinson has been appointed President of Mercer, where he will work closely with Martine through a transition period and have responsibility for Mercer's global health, wealth, and career practices. Pat will succeed Martine as President and CEO of Mercer upon her retirement. I'm excited to work with Pat in his new role. He brings an outstanding track record as a leader and strong knowledge of our business. He currently serves as Marsh McLennan, U.S. and Canada CEO; and Mercer President of U.S. and Canada; has had 26 years of industry experience, including the last nine years in leadership roles at Mercer. I also want to thank Martine for her leadership. In her five years as CEO of Mercer, she delivered strong growth, built and cultivated our talent, and delivered impact for our clients. This announcement is another example of our depth of exceptional talent and focus on succession planning. Overall, I am proud of our third quarter performance, which demonstrates continued execution of our strategy and continued momentum across our business. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they deliver to our clients, shareholders, and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney : Thank you, John, and good morning. Our third quarter results were outstanding, continued momentum in underlying growth, strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth and significant margin expansion. Our consolidated revenue increased 13% to $5.4 billion, with underlying growth of 10%. Operating income was $996 million and adjusted operating income was $1.1 billion, up 24% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 21.3%. GAAP EPS was $1.47 and adjusted EPS was $1.57, up 33% over last year. Note that adjusted EPS in the third quarter included a $0.10 discrete tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets. Even without this benefit, our adjusted EPS grew 25% in the quarter. For the first nine months of 2023, underlying revenue growth was 10%. Adjusted operating income grew 17% to $4.4 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points and adjusted EPS increased 17% to $6.31. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, up 12% from a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis. This result marks the tenth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in nearly two decades. Operating income increased 21% to $640 million. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to $671 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 23.4%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue in RIS was $10.8 billion. With underlying growth of 12%, adjusted operating income increased 18% to $3.3 billion. Margin increased 150 basis points to 32.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 9% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 8% growth in the third quarter of last year. Growth in the third quarter reflected solid new business and strong retention. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 6% for the quarter, led by strong growth in MMA. In International, underlying growth was 10% and comes on top of 11% in the third quarter of last year. Latin America was up 14%. Asia Pacific was up 10% and EMEA grew 9%. For the first nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $8.5 billion, with underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada grew 7% and International was up 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $359 million in the quarter, up 9% or 8% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth across our global specialties and regions. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $2 billion of revenue, 10% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, third quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, up 13% from a year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $424 million. Adjusted operating income increased 24% to $447 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 20.8%. For the first nine months of 2023, consulting revenue was $6.4 billion, with underlying growth of 7%. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $1.3 billion. The adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 20.1%. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 8% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's best quarter of underlying growth in 15 years. Wealth grew 7%, driven by continued demand in defined benefits consulting and higher growth in investment management. Our assets under management were $379 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 19% compared to the third quarter of last year and down 4% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transaction with Westpac, a rebound in capital markets, and positive net flows. Health underlying growth was 8% and reflected strength in all segments and regions. Career revenue increased 7%, on top of 15% growth in the third quarter of last year. We continue to see growth in rewards and talent strategy. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $4.1 billion, with 7% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $781 million, an increase of 12% on an underlying basis that reflected strength in the Middle East and Europe. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $2.3 billion, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis. Foreign exchange was a $0.01 headwind to EPS in the third quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX will have an immaterial effect on fourth quarter earnings. We reported $52 million of total restructuring costs in the quarter, approximately $37 million of which relates to the program we announced in the fourth quarter last year. These charges include costs related to severance, lease exits and streamlining our technology environment. We've continued to pursue efficiencies under this program, and our outlook for savings has increased. As John noted, we now expect total charges of $425 million to $475 million and expect total savings of roughly $400 million, of which approximately $225 million will be realized in 2023. To date, we have incurred approximately $325 million of charges under this program. We currently expect to incur the majority of the remaining charges by the end of 2023 and to realize the bulk of the remaining savings in 2024. Our other net benefit credit was $62 million in the quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $1 million in the third quarter on a GAAP basis and $2 million on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the third quarter was $145 million, up from $118 million in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $157 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 20.5% compared with 24.6% in the third quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. The largest discrete item this quarter was a $48 million release of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of around 25.5% for 2023. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total debt of $13.6 billion. This includes the $1.6 billion of senior notes we issued in September. Our next scheduled debt maturities are in March 2024, when $1 billion of senior notes mature and in May, when another $600 million of senior notes come due. We also recently took the opportunity to increase borrowing capacity under our credit facility, increasing the size of the facility to $3.5 billion from $2.8 billion and extending the term of the facility by 2.5 years to 2028. This was a prudent step to increase our access to short-term funding given the significant growth in our business since we last renewed the facility in April 2021. We are also pleased that Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to A3 in September. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $2.9 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion, included $353 million for dividends, $368 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $2.9 billion and included $944 million for dividends, $1.1 billion for acquisitions, and $900 million for share repurchases. Overall, we remain on track for a terrific 2023. Based on our outlook today and assuming current conditions persist, we expect to generate 9% to 10% full-year underlying revenue growth, strong growth in adjusted EPS and to report margin expansion for the 16th consecutive year. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.\nJohn Doyle : Thank you, Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the U.S., Canada within Marsh. Organic of 6%, but that is a slowdown from where you guys were in the first part of the year. Can you just give a little bit more color on what's causing the slowdown? And then I think in the introductory comments, you guys mentioned that MMA saw strong growth. So, can you give us a sense of the growth within MMA and the growth outside of MMA within that segment?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Elyse. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Again, overall, I was quite pleased with the growth -- the revenue growth in the quarter. We had good growth at Marsh. Best growth at Mercer in 15 years. And again, strong performance at Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman. Marsh U.S., inclusive of MMA, and I would also note our MGA operation had a good quarter as well. Growth was strong. Marsh U.S. was up 6% versus 5% a year ago. Again, we caution you to look at growth at any one -- at any one quarter. We think we're well-positioned, and our team is executing well. Martin, do you have any other color on what impacted growth at Marsh this quarter?\nMartin South : Yes. Thank you, John. As you said, very strong growth for Marsh across the board in International and North America. As you said, we don't comment on specifically on MMA, but they've had a good quarter. The growth in the MGA business was strong. There's partly some impact from the capital markets and some moderating growth in financial construction, cyber lines reflecting some pricing pressures. But as you say, we don't look at this on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We look it over a longer period of time, and we feel very positive about the U.S. business and the Canadian business.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Martin. Elyse, do you have a follow-up?\nElyse Greenspan : Yes. And then my second question. So, on the revised savings program, is there a way to give us a sense -- you mentioned, John, it came from rationalizing tech, real estate, and realigning the workforce. How much each of those buckets are contributing to the extra savings? And then is it still fair to assume that most of the savings that you're expecting this year should be falling to the bottom line?\nJohn Doyle: So really, backing up a little bit, Elyse. As our business has operated more closely together, we've just identified additional opportunities. They're largely in the same areas, right? It's around realigning our workforce and mostly in functions, I would say, as opposed to market-facing workforce talent, real estate, and technology. We've not broken it out by group, but the costs are severance, lease terminations, and streamlining technology. So again, we're excited about some of the opportunities that we've uncovered and I'm proud of the team. We're executing against them.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Good morning. So, first question on the reinsurance market. I think you mentioned the word firm in terms of pricing. And are you expecting prices to be up further from these current levels? Or firm just means that they'll be somewhat stable? And then how do you think that will affect your growth? At Guy Carpenter, you've grown double digits this year. I'm not sure how much of that is because of the tailwind from pricing.\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Jimmy. I did use the word firm. There's no question. Our team at Guy Carpenter has done a terrific job this year, helping our clients navigate what's a challenging market. As I said, I expect that the market on January 1 will certainly be more orderly than last year. But there are concerns both in the insurance and reinsurance market about rising loss costs. And so, we don't want to project and can't really project with accuracy and there's still a quarter to run. We expect underwriting discipline to remain. But with that, maybe, Dean, you could offer some thoughts on Guy Carpenter and what we think of the market?\nDean Klisura : Thanks, John. And Jimmy, maybe I'll give you a little color between property cat and casualty as John mentioned. As John noted, we expect challenging market conditions to persist for property cat at the upcoming January 1 renewal, as John noted, driven by inflation. As you're reading about, I mean, cat losses continue to be very elevated. Many attritional losses. Many billion dollar plus events this year. Political instability continues. We do expect pricing to remain firm in property cat. It will vary region by region. It won't be what we saw last year, as an example, in the U.S. and Europe, but we do think that firmness will be there. We do expect additional capacity and an increased appetite from reinsurers to write more business, particularly at higher attaching property cat layers. But I think the key is we expect reinsurers to continue to exhibit that discipline on attachment points, pricing and terms, and I don't see anything going backwards. As John noted, we think property cat capacity in the market will remain adequate. And as John noted, we think it will be a more manageable renewal for our clients. without that significant supply, demand imbalance and dislocation that we saw last year. And we do expect increased demand for our clients to buy more reinsurance and particularly key regions like Europe. On the casualty side, for U.S. Casualty, as John noted, the market is trending very cautiously. And all of our meetings with reinsurers this fall, everybody expressed concern with prior year loss development in U.S. casualty and certain lines, again, driven by economic and social inflation. And we do expect some downward pressure from reinsurers on seating commissions for our clients with quota share contracts and certain casualty lines. But in casualty, we do expect capacity to remain adequate.\nJohn Doyle: The cost of risk, Jimmy is rising, and it's up to us to find the best solutions in the market for both our insurance and reinsurance clients. And so, I think we're well positioned to do that. Do you have a follow-up?\nJimmy Bhullar: Just on Oliver Wyman. I think typically, you think of Oliver Wyman as being sensitive to economic uncertainty. And this year, the business has shown a lot of momentum. So maybe -- I know you won the UBS, I don't know UBS Credit Suisse integration contract, but I'm not sure how material that is. But what's really driving Oliver Wyman? And what's your sort of pipeline look like? And how do you think about it performing if the economy does, in fact, slow down?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks, Jimmy. Oliver Wyman has been more sensitive to GDP over time, but it's also been a faster growing part of our business over time as well. And after a relatively slow start to the year, Oliver Wyman had a terrific run, is now having strong growth year-to-date and a very, very strong quarter. So, Nick, maybe you can share with Jimmy some color on how things look at Oliver Wyman.\nNick Studer : Thank you, John, and thank you, Jimmy. Yes, let me enlarge on that a little bit. It's definitely not an easy environment for discretionary spending in our clients. I still see a fairly wide range of possible economic paths. But John called out our wider resilience of Marsh McLennan, and I'm proud that Oliver Wyman has demonstrated that resilience and chlorine our way back from a flat to Q1. And as Martin said as well, we do try to look at the business on a year-over-year basis more than a quarter-over-quarter basis, but it does matter. We're quite a diverse business now, and we've been becoming more diverse. So, if you think about the sectors that are driving our growth in the regions, our India, Middle East and Africa region has been the biggest contributor to our regional growth with Europe also contributing strongly. On the sectoral side, public sector, which is quite present in the Middle East, our communications, media and technology practice followed by banking, followed by transportation and services. So again, quite a wide array of industry sectors there. And maybe just an interesting case study on the industry side would be our private equity, private capital practice. Clearly, it's not been a great deal environment. But that practice has been doing quite well, driven by portfolio company work. And over the last few years, I've said a few times and have been asked questions about our offerings through the cycle, which we've been seeking to broaden our economic research practices grew strongly, our digital team, our restructuring practice, which is nascent, grew very strongly. Our work on performance transformation with clients, which is more of a tough economic environment offering as well as our people in organizational performance work where we do a lot of collaboration with Mercer. So ultimately, I'm optimistic in our long-term growth prospects, but we continue to plan for mid to high single-digit growth over the longer term. And our pipeline is looking in line with that at this moment.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\nMichael Zaremski: Good morning, thanks. I guess just a follow-up to the last question about kind of global growth. So, Marsh's growth clearly records high levels. I feel like historically, there's been more of a correlation between growth and nominal GDP. If you do agree with that, it just feels like there's been a decoupling of that relationship recently and a good way for you, obviously. And just curious if there's anything structurally permanently that's changed? Or is it -- are there kind of temporary phenomenon with tires? Or anything you want to call out if you agree with the premise of my question.\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Mike. What I would say is it is a volatile macro environment, certainly, both the economy and geopolitically, as I mentioned before. But I do believe nominal GDP is a better indicator of demand over time and with inflation, tight labor markets and pricing positive in the P&C market, those macro factors are certainly supportive of growth. But what I would also say is we've been working very hard to shift our mix of business to better growth markets over time. A handful of examples, M&A, of course, the middle market at both Marsh and Mercer. ROCIO business we've been investing in. We have invested organically and inorganically throughout Asia. And then more broadly, we've invested in talent, sales operations, and our client engagement model. So, we believe we're a better growth business and better positioned. And while, again, that macro environment is quite volatile, we're confident in our ability to perform over economic cycles.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. If I could ask a follow-up, and hopefully, it's not out of left field, but there's been a chatter in the media and at a recent wholesale conference about potentially some of the larger brokers getting back into the wholesale business. I'm not sure if you want to comment on that or can. But maybe you can at least offer some perspective on why Marsh doesn't have as big of a wholesale presence relative to just its market share of non-wholesale insurance?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Sure, Mark -- Mike, excuse me, I'm happy to comment. I mean, first of all, I would say that the E&S market volumes historically have moved with pricing cycles. I think given the volatile risk environment, I suspect that E&S market volumes will be more durable than they've been historically. Underwriters are looking for flexibility. And third-party wholesalers can give us access to certain markets. At the same time, we access some E&S markets directly today. And so -- in terms of third-party wholesale, I think we'd have to be thoughtful about whether or not we would be a good owner. We do have a business in Victor that does a lot of business with independent really small commercial Main Street agents. That's a marketplace we can serve and do serve today with solutions. But our focus, again, broadly speaking, in Marsh's business is about bringing the entirety of the market, all solutions that are out there, whether they're standard market or admitted market solutions or non-admitted solutions. We want to have the flexibility to do that, and that's what we do to make sure that we can protect and bring the best solutions to our clients. Hopefully, that was helpful.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden : Thanks, good morning. John, in the press release, you mentioned continuing to make investments for the future in this quarter. I'm just wondering if there was an acceleration in some of those investments this quarter, particularly in RIS? And if so, if you could walk through the nature of them and how we can think about the future revenue contribution?\nJohn Doyle: No, I don't -- thanks, David. I don't see it as an acceleration in the quarter. Certainly, on a GAAP basis, in the quarter, expense growth was impacted by M&A, restructuring, but also FX. And even on an adjusted basis, obviously, FX played a role there. But as I said earlier, we're trying to balance delivering today and investing for the future. We're not trying to optimize margins in a particular quarter or for that matter, in a year. We've got a track record, a disciplined track record of growing revenue faster than expense, but we're not going to do it in every quarter, in every business, and every quarter. And so, we see right opportunities to make investments that we think are going to create opportunities for us to deliver value for our clients. We're going to make them.\nDavid Motemaden : Got it. And then just on the Marsh Global Pricing Index, I guess I'm wondering just if we're seeing an acceleration in some of the casualty lines, excluding workers' comp and excluding financial lines, if you're seeing an acceleration there, it sounded like on the reinsurance side, there's a bit more discipline that's entering the market given some social inflation concerns. I'm wondering if you're seeing any signs of that in the primary market?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, it's not a market. I would suggest it's really a collection of markets. And what we saw in the third quarter was, on average, pretty similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. I would note, as it relates to our income statement, we have different levels of commission exposure to different products, right? So, it doesn't always add up to the same amount. But it's a mixed market, and maybe I'll ask Martin to share some thoughts. And just to remind everyone, it's our role is to get the best solution for our retail clients in the marketplace. And we have a role as a market maker, too. And so, we've done a few things as a market maker to try to bring more efficient financing solutions to our clients. Martin?\nMartin South : Yes, I agree with that, John. That's our job. Just to level set, we're in the 24th consecutive quarter of rate increases. We'll release our survey in a couple of weeks' time. And I don't think we're at an inflection point when it comes to pricing. The pricing cycles we're seeing across the different geographies and product lines are beginning to show a mix of strengths and weaknesses depending on the combination. The third quarter Casualty grew at 3%. It grew in 3% the quarter before and the quarter before -- and the quarter before. So, we're not seeing an acceleration. But I would say we're hearing a lot more talk from carriers about pressures on pricing and social facing and some of the nuclear verdicts that are out there, and we're keeping our clients closely posted on those. Property was at 7%. These rates were roughly in line with the prior quarter. We saw some softness in FINPRO lines. FINPRO lines came down by 6% in the third quarter. They were down 8% in the quarter before. So, I don't think that's a trend yet, but it's certainly less. And as you mentioned in the introduction, John, our cyber index came down by 2%, and it was up by 1% in the quarter, so three percentage point delta between the courses. So, it's a relatively calm market that we'll see on casualty.\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Martin. What I would also say, David, and I mentioned this to Jimmy, but clearly, the cost of risk is rising, right? So, whether it's a frequency of cat events, including extreme weather, casualty loss costs, whether it's core inflation, social inflation, some of the underwriting community referring to as legal system abuse, the growth in litigation funding, concerns for our clients for sure and the underwriting community as well. Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox : Thanks, for taking my question. So, I think last quarter, there were some comments that I interpreted as expectations for the level of margin expansion to accelerate in RIS in the second half, but it was just a bit lower. So just curious if you could talk about the puts and takes with respect to the margin relative to and whether it's still fair to assume that the second half of the year will have stronger margin expansion than 2Q?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Sure, Rob. Again, margins and outcome, it's not our primary objective. Our focus is on growing earnings and free cash flow over time. We're not trying to optimize margin expansion in any period, certainly in any business in any period. We do expect solid margin expansion in 2023, which will be our 16th consecutive year of margin expansion. There were FX headwinds in RIS' margins in the third quarter. But again, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made there. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, again, we expect good solid margin expansion in 2023.\nRobert Cox : Got it. And maybe just a follow-up. I think some peers have highlighted expectations for medical costs to increase. So, I was hoping if you could discuss the trends you're seeing in the health and benefit space and expectations as we look into 2024.\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Rob. I'll ask Martine to comment in a second, but we've had good growth in our health and benefits business at Mercer in our business internationally, which is Mercer Marsh Benefits and at MMA. It is a pressure point, clearly, for our clients in this economy. And so, clients more and more looking to us for solutions there. Martine, maybe you could share some insights.\nMartine Ferland: Yes. Thank you, Robert, for the question. Thank you, John. Indeed, medical inflation is increasing. And as John just said, it's an advantage for our clients. At the same time, it's not a big part of our revenue sources because a lot of our clients are on fee-based or those kinds of things. When -- we're also working a lot with clients to try to control those costs, control those increases. Because, as you may know, in the health benefit space, very, very often, employers would share the cost with the employee base. So, in this time of our inflation, they're pretty concerned about passing on those costs. So, we're looking at design of the plan, access in a different way, leveraging technology, et cetera. So, there's many different ways that our clients -- that we can help our clients address those increase in costs. And it's impacting revenue a little bit, but honestly, it's a small part for us given all of the counterpoints.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Good morning. Two quick questions, if I can. First, John, you talked about macroeconomic uncertainty. I'm wondering how that impacts near-term visibility typically for Mercer in terms of revenue?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Meyer. I would say, as I said, obviously, the macro economy remains uncertain, and there is a fair amount of questions about it. What I would say is mature markets have relatively resilient, but inflation of cost persists Central banks are -- their primary mission is to reduce inflation. But we do see a meaningful risk of recession, and we're prepared for that sure. And some markets are in recession now. But I'll ask Nick, Martine, again, I think Oliver Wyman historically has been a bit more sensitive to GDP and Mercer's Career business has as well. But Nick, maybe you could share some thoughts on the economy and what you think that might mean to our business.\nNick Studer : Yes. Thank you, John. Thank you, Meyer. It's -- as I said earlier on, I think it is a wide range of economic paths that I see different of our sectors do react differently -- and some of our industries have been having a pretty tough time since sort of through and since the pandemic. Some have seen little spurts of growth. We've been growing in some sectors, for example, Aerospace and Defense, where we made a significant acquisition last year, which we see as being more robust through the cycle. I do think that a tough economic outlook tends to result in slower growth for Oliver Wyman. But as I said earlier, we've been trying to develop a wider set of through-the-cycle offerings. And sometimes when the questions all change, people need help answering them. So, it's definitely not a correlation anymore. I think it probably -- that correlation has declined over time and it's pretty low now.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Nick. Martine, maybe you can share some thoughts on Mercer Career?\nMartine Ferland: Yes. absolutely. And over the last few years, we have focused also on diversifying our portfolio of businesses, and we've improved our business mix a little bit away from the more discretionary nature of the business, particularly in Career with more recurring type of work. And I would add to that, that with our -- with the current environment, there's also lots of demand, as Nick just said. You look at volatile capital markets, for example, drives demand for advice in our defined benefit and our different completion businesses well-funded, the fund benefit plan on the back of high interest rates and also creating demand for pension risk transfer. We talked about tight labor markets, the different -- the change in the ways of working, the upcoming of digital health and technology in the workplace. It's all driving demand and countering the more traditional, I would say, of previous year's impact of direct correlation to GDP, as we discussed earlier.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Martine. So, we, of course, Meyer, are not immune to economic growth, but we're a resilient business. And again, we have a track record of performing across economic cycles. And at the moment, demand remains strong. Do you have a follow-up?\nMeyer Shields: I do. Just a quick one. That was very helpful. With regard to Oliver Wyman, in the past, I guess, you've communicated that Oliver Wyman, when you have strong growth, there could be some pressure on consulting margins just because of the nature of that business. And we didn't see that in this quarter. I'm wondering, is that context of lower margins of Oliver Wyman less true now?\nJohn Doyle: No, it's not less true. But again, keep in mind, Mercer had its best quarter of growth. It's a bigger business than Oliver Wyman and it's best quarter of growth in 15 years. So that's the reason you didn't see anything there.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets.\nScott Heleniak: Good morning. Just at Marsh, just wondering if you could comment what's driving double-digit growth there at EMEA and Latin America? I know that's been strong for a few quarters, but can you give more detail on that? Is there any new areas we're seeing growth? And is there much of a benefit from rate increases there?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, sure. Happy to talk about that, Scott. Again, very pleased with our growth at Marsh. It was particularly strong in the International segment in the quarter. And in spite of mixed economic outcomes in Europe, our business is performing exceptionally well there. And we've had good growth over a long period of time in Latin America. Martin, maybe you could share some color on growth in both of those markets.\nMartin South : I'd be thrilled to. Yes. As you say, great growth in international, 10%; Latin America, up 14%; APAC, 10%, EMEA, 9%. So really, really pleasing growth. I'd say there are a few areas that are outstanding at the moment, the energy and power business, the transition is fueling growth. Credit Specialties had a terrific quarter in aviation, as well as MMB, which is a big part of our business in Europe delivered strong double-digit growth. And our advisory business, our value proposition is to go to market through a lens to help our clients think through the cost of risk. And so that's been a big growth area for us as we think that, and we think that will continue to broaden our opportunities. That's been great growth. It's been good growth between renewal and new bid business across the business and we've had less lost business. The clients are staying with us longer as they see the value in an organization like ours that has such broad capabilities. So, we feel very good about that across the board. And of course, you've got the fundamentals in Latin America with protection gap and somewhat emerging markets in Eastern Europe as well that have had a very strong growth as well. So, we feel well positioned and very positive about the trajectory there.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Martin. Scott, do you have a follow-up?\nScott Heleniak: Yes. Just one other quick follow-up here. Just on M&A, you did those a couple of bigger sized deals in the quarter. Just wondering if you could just comment on your M&A pipeline versus where it was maybe six months to nine months ago? You're feeling a bit better about those opportunities as you go into 2024, and maybe some areas that you're looking at in particular with the focus areas?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. We remain quite active in the market and the pipeline remains solid for sure. And again, I just want to emphasize how pleased we were to welcome Grant to the family in the third quarter, and we expect to close Hanon relatively soon. They're two well-led businesses. Well positioned solid growth fundamentals in both of them, expanding our presence in the middle market, which gets back to the mix point that I was making earlier. So overall, we closed five deals in the quarter. Those were the two bigger ones. We're very excited about it. We're certainly -- it's an active marketplace. While there's fewer transactions, there's a lot that is at play. And so, we're wide out about and clear on what we're looking for. Valuations remain elevated for strong businesses that are in the market. But we know what we're looking for and we know how to manage the risk of M&A. And so, we're going to be selective and disciplined, but we expect to continue to deploy capital inorganically.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley.\nBob Huang : Hi, thank you. So maybe if we can just go back to Oliver Wyman a little bit. Previously, you mentioned that regarding the UBS and Credit Suisse merger deal. That happened in the second quarter. Just curious if that was a meaningful driver of organic growth for Oliver Wyman into the second quarter and third quarter? And also, on top of that, do you expect any residual from that deal to come through in the fourth quarter and going forward for Oliver Wyman?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Bob. We're not going to comment on individual clients and the work that we do for individual clients. So as Nick talked about a couple of different times on this call, we have an increasingly diverse set of offerings that we think is more resilient, and we're very, very pleased with the growth at Oliver Wyman through three quarters. Again, quarter-to-quarter, we could see more volatility and expect to see more volatility at Oliver Wyman's top-line than our other businesses. But we also expect Oliver Wyman to grow faster over a medium term and longer term. And that's certainly been the case. That's been the case in this year, and we expect it to be the case over the longer term. Do you have a follow-up?\nScott Heleniak: Yes, sure. So, one more thing very quickly. Regarding your cyber insurance practice. I know you mentioned that the cyber insurance pricing growth is slowing down a little bit. There had been a few relatively large headline cyber incidents as well as some cyber claims, namely in the casino gaming area as well as the government, and other areas. Do you expect the current slowdown in cyber pricing maybe just sort of in a soft patch? But do you expect that pricing growth to rebound back? Or do you think the cyber insurance pricing will just kind of stay where it is right now?\nJohn Doyle: Bob, what I -- again, the most important point to make here is it's our job to find efficient risk financing solutions for our clients. So, what I would say is, yes, there's been some major breaches that will drive some insured losses in the marketplace. There's also been an increase, again, in the number of ransomware claims that's -- that have happened during the course of this year. But I would also note that the underwriting community has reacted to growing ransomware claims over the course of the last couple of years through higher attachment points. The market is also -- the underwriting market is also reacting to possible systemic events that could aggregate losses in their portfolios. We're, of course, helping them at Guy Carpenter and at the same time, working with Marsh to build better solutions for that. But the market's been restricting coverage for systemic type events. And so that's a factor in that marketplace as well. And so, I don't think the market will move meaningfully based on a couple of losses. But we have some work to do collectively to help in a digital economy. When I say collectively, I mean the royal we, the entire marketplace, in coming up with better solutions to help clients manage the risks -- cyber-related risks in a digital economy. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.\nRyan Tunis : So, some competitors have like very specifically highlighted pressures -- organic growth pressures in the U.S. from D&O capital markets-related transactions. You mentioned it briefly. Just curious, when we look at your U.S., Canada within Marsh, is there any reason to believe that you guys wouldn't be wearing a headwind of similar magnitude?\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Ryan, for the question. Yes, I think Martin pointed this out. There's -- I can't talk about relative exposure. But clearly, capital market volatility, the rising cost of capital, M&A activity is down. IPO activity is down. SPACs are down. DSPACs down, all those kinds of things that drive risk and create opportunities for us to offer advice and solutions are under some pressure. And somewhat related to that, as Martin also noted earlier, pricing is down as well. And so those are headwinds. But again, we have a well-diversified business in the United States. We help our clients manage a wide range of risks. And broadly speaking, again, the cost of risk continues to rise for the factors that I mentioned earlier on the call. So, thank you, Ryan. I appreciate that, and I want to thank you all for joining us on the call. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you, all, very much, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's program.

            "content": "Thanks, John. And Jimmy, maybe I'll give you a little color between property cat and casualty as John mentioned. As John noted, we expect challenging market conditions to persist for property cat at the upcoming January 1 renewal, as John noted, driven by inflation. As you're reading about, I mean, cat losses continue to be very elevated. Many attritional losses. Many billion dollar plus events this year. Political instability continues. We do expect pricing to remain firm in property cat. It will vary region by region. It won't be what we saw last year, as an example, in the U.S. and Europe, but we do think that firmness will be there. We do expect additional capacity and an increased appetite from reinsurers to write more business, particularly at higher attaching property cat layers. But I think the key is we expect reinsurers to continue to exhibit that discipline on attachment points, pricing and terms, and I don't see anything going backwards. As John noted, we think property cat capacity in the market will remain adequate. And as John noted, we think it will be a more manageable renewal for our clients. without that significant supply, demand imbalance and dislocation that we saw last year. And we do expect increased demand for our clients to buy more reinsurance and particularly key regions like Europe. On the casualty side, for U.S. Casualty, as John noted, the market is trending very cautiously. And all of our meetings with reinsurers this fall, everybody expressed concern with prior year loss development in U.S. casualty and certain lines, again, driven by economic and social inflation. And we do expect some downward pressure from reinsurers on seating commissions for our clients with quota share contracts and certain casualty lines. But in casualty, we do expect capacity to remain adequate."

            "name": "John Doyle",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President, and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also, with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Before I get into our results, I'd like to take a moment to comment on the violent attacks on Israel and the tragic events unfolding in Israel and Gaza. We, along with our colleagues, condemn all acts of terror and violence and reject hatred. Our primary focus is on ensuring the safety and well-being of our colleagues in Tel Aviv and supporting colleagues around the world who have family and friends in Israel and Gaza. We're also supporting our clients as they grapple with the challenges of this conflict. Turning to our third quarter results. I'm very pleased with our performance. We extended our best run of quarterly underlying revenue growth in over two decades and reported significant growth in adjusted EPS. Top-line momentum continued with 10% underlying revenue growth, on top of 8% growth in the third quarter of last year. Adjusted operating income grew 24% versus a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2022. Adjusted EPS grew 33%, and we completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter. These results reflect our consistent focus on delivering in the near term, while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We are seeing the benefit of investments we've made in our talent and capabilities, and we continue to see opportunities to add high-quality acquisitions. During the third quarter, we announced two significant transactions. In early August, Marsh McLennan Agency acquired Graham Company, a top 100 U.S. insurance and benefits broker and risk management consultancy with 215 employees and over $70 million in revenue. Graham will provide significant business insurance and employee benefits expertise for MMA's clients in the Mid-Atlantic. This acquisition is another example of us attracting the best agencies in the U.S. MMA is now a $3 billion revenue business. In the same month, Marsh announced an agreement to acquire Honan Insurance Group. This deal expands our Australian middle market business and our position across the Pacific region and Asia. Honan specializes in corporate risk and employee benefits and serves over 30,000 clients. Beyond acquisitions, we continue to make targeted investments in talent, sales operations, and go-to-market strategies. We are also investing in new technologies and solutions to bring the best of Marsh McLennan to our clients. For example, Guy Carpenter recently launched the next generation of our catastrophe analytics platform, GC Advantage Point. The new platform is a critical tool to help clients drive profitable risk selection and manage catastrophe exposure in a quickly evolving risk landscape. Earlier this year, Marsh announced the launch of Cyber Pathway, an integrated cybersecurity and insurance solution for U.S. small and midsized businesses that helps enhance the resilience in a volatile threat environment. The program provides access to key security tools and capabilities as well as insurance coverage that can grow as our clients evolve. And we are investing in technologies that enhance our internal productivity, insights for clients and improve colleague experience. One example is LenAI, Marsh McLennan's internal AI assistant. LenAI offers the power of ChatGPT in a safe and data-secure environment and is available to all colleagues. Developed by our innovation center, it's also helping Oliver Wyman support clients in developing their own AI capabilities. Our approach to balancing investment and growth drives consistent exceptional performance for shareholders and positions us well to deliver new solutions and insights for our clients. Turning to our strategic initiatives. The combined value proposition of our businesses continues to gain traction with clients, especially in certain industries and lines of business. For example, we are focused on enterprise risks for healthcare clients. Our Marsh and Mercer teams are coming together to respond to emerging challenges, such as health and safety, labor actions, and workforce and liability risks from AI. In the private equity and M&A space, Mercer, Marsh, and Oliver Wyman are combining capabilities to help client's close deals and create post-transaction value. This can include due diligence, advisory on large transformations, health and benefits carve-out transactions, and providing stop-loss solutions. And in the insurance sector, Guy Carpenter is partnering with Mercer to provide portfolio management solutions to insurance clients. One example is our advanced balance sheet solution, which is a collaborative approach that aligns risk and return across an insurer's balance sheet. This offering has already resulted in several regional insurers choosing to partner with Mercer for OCIO. We are also finding new ways to operate, reduce complexity, and organize for impact. As we continue to execute on our restructuring actions, we've identified additional opportunities to rationalize technology, reduce our real estate footprint, and realign our workforce. We now expect to achieve total savings of roughly $400 million by 2024, with total cost to achieve these savings of $425 million to $475 million. Overall, the momentum we are seeing as our businesses increasingly serve clients together, combined with our restructuring efforts, offers opportunities to deliver enhanced value for clients, drive higher growth, and be more efficient and connected. Now let me turn to the macro environment. The outlook remains uncertain. Capital market volatility has returned with the continued rise in interest rates. The trajectory of inflation and further central bank tightening remain an open question and the geopolitical situation remains volatile. Despite the environment, we continue to perform well, and we have a track record of resilience. We believe we are well positioned to perform across economic cycles and manage our business to grow revenues faster than expenses in good as well as challenging periods. Now let me turn to insurance and reinsurance market conditions. Primary insurance rates continue to increase with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 3% overall, in line with the second quarter. Property rates increased 7% compared to 10% in the second quarter. Casualty pricing was up in the low single-digit range. Workers' compensation increased slightly, while financial and professional liability insurance rates were down mid-single digits. Cyber insurance pricing decreased modestly after several years of increases. In reinsurance, our clients have faced consistent challenges throughout 2023. This includes elevated cat losses, core and social inflation, and continued political instability. As we look to January 1, the market appears to be more orderly than last year, but we expect underwriting discipline to continue. On the property side, we expect firm pricing, but a more stable market with adequate capacity and increased reinsurer appetite. In casualty, the market is more cautious with reinsurers assessing prior year loss development and inflation. We expect capacity to remain stable. Overall, clients will need thorough preparation and a proactive strategy to achieve desired outcomes. We are well-positioned to help our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.57, which is up 33% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 10%. Underlying revenue grew 11% in RIS and 9% in Consulting. Marsh was up 8%, Guy Carpenter 8%, Mercer 8%, and Oliver Wyman grew 12%. Overall, the third quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 24% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points year-over-year. For the nine months, consolidated revenue grew 10% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 17% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $6.31, up 17% from a year ago. With our outstanding results in the third quarter and year-to-date, we remain on track for a terrific year. Based on our outlook today and assuming current market conditions persist, we now expect full-year underlying revenue growth to be 9% to 10%. We also continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Finally, I want to provide an update on our recently announced leadership changes. Martine Ferland, CEO of Mercer, will retire on March 31 of next year. Pat Tomlinson has been appointed President of Mercer, where he will work closely with Martine through a transition period and have responsibility for Mercer's global health, wealth, and career practices. Pat will succeed Martine as President and CEO of Mercer upon her retirement. I'm excited to work with Pat in his new role. He brings an outstanding track record as a leader and strong knowledge of our business. He currently serves as Marsh McLennan, U.S. and Canada CEO; and Mercer President of U.S. and Canada; has had 26 years of industry experience, including the last nine years in leadership roles at Mercer. I also want to thank Martine for her leadership. In her five years as CEO of Mercer, she delivered strong growth, built and cultivated our talent, and delivered impact for our clients. This announcement is another example of our depth of exceptional talent and focus on succession planning. Overall, I am proud of our third quarter performance, which demonstrates continued execution of our strategy and continued momentum across our business. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they deliver to our clients, shareholders, and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. Thank you, Mark. Operator, we are ready to begin Q&A. Sure, Elyse. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Again, overall, I was quite pleased with the growth -- the revenue growth in the quarter. We had good growth at Marsh. Best growth at Mercer in 15 years. And again, strong performance at Guy Carpenter and Oliver Wyman. Marsh U.S., inclusive of MMA, and I would also note our MGA operation had a good quarter as well. Growth was strong. Marsh U.S. was up 6% versus 5% a year ago. Again, we caution you to look at growth at any one -- at any one quarter. We think we're well-positioned, and our team is executing well. Martin, do you have any other color on what impacted growth at Marsh this quarter? Thanks, Martin. Elyse, do you have a follow-up? So really, backing up a little bit, Elyse. As our business has operated more closely together, we've just identified additional opportunities. They're largely in the same areas, right? It's around realigning our workforce and mostly in functions, I would say, as opposed to market-facing workforce talent, real estate, and technology. We've not broken it out by group, but the costs are severance, lease terminations, and streamlining technology. So again, we're excited about some of the opportunities that we've uncovered and I'm proud of the team. We're executing against them. Yes. Thanks, Jimmy. I did use the word firm. There's no question. Our team at Guy Carpenter has done a terrific job this year, helping our clients navigate what's a challenging market. As I said, I expect that the market on January 1 will certainly be more orderly than last year. But there are concerns both in the insurance and reinsurance market about rising loss costs. And so, we don't want to project and can't really project with accuracy and there's still a quarter to run. We expect underwriting discipline to remain. But with that, maybe, Dean, you could offer some thoughts on Guy Carpenter and what we think of the market? The cost of risk, Jimmy is rising, and it's up to us to find the best solutions in the market for both our insurance and reinsurance clients. And so, I think we're well positioned to do that. Do you have a follow-up? Yes, thanks, Jimmy. Oliver Wyman has been more sensitive to GDP over time, but it's also been a faster growing part of our business over time as well. And after a relatively slow start to the year, Oliver Wyman had a terrific run, is now having strong growth year-to-date and a very, very strong quarter. So, Nick, maybe you can share with Jimmy some color on how things look at Oliver Wyman. Sure, Mike. What I would say is it is a volatile macro environment, certainly, both the economy and geopolitically, as I mentioned before. But I do believe nominal GDP is a better indicator of demand over time and with inflation, tight labor markets and pricing positive in the P&C market, those macro factors are certainly supportive of growth. But what I would also say is we've been working very hard to shift our mix of business to better growth markets over time. A handful of examples, M&A, of course, the middle market at both Marsh and Mercer. ROCIO business we've been investing in. We have invested organically and inorganically throughout Asia. And then more broadly, we've invested in talent, sales operations, and our client engagement model. So, we believe we're a better growth business and better positioned. And while, again, that macro environment is quite volatile, we're confident in our ability to perform over economic cycles. Yes. Sure, Mark -- Mike, excuse me, I'm happy to comment. I mean, first of all, I would say that the E&S market volumes historically have moved with pricing cycles. I think given the volatile risk environment, I suspect that E&S market volumes will be more durable than they've been historically. Underwriters are looking for flexibility. And third-party wholesalers can give us access to certain markets. At the same time, we access some E&S markets directly today. And so -- in terms of third-party wholesale, I think we'd have to be thoughtful about whether or not we would be a good owner. We do have a business in Victor that does a lot of business with independent really small commercial Main Street agents. That's a marketplace we can serve and do serve today with solutions. But our focus, again, broadly speaking, in Marsh's business is about bringing the entirety of the market, all solutions that are out there, whether they're standard market or admitted market solutions or non-admitted solutions. We want to have the flexibility to do that, and that's what we do to make sure that we can protect and bring the best solutions to our clients. Hopefully, that was helpful. No, I don't -- thanks, David. I don't see it as an acceleration in the quarter. Certainly, on a GAAP basis, in the quarter, expense growth was impacted by M&A, restructuring, but also FX. And even on an adjusted basis, obviously, FX played a role there. But as I said earlier, we're trying to balance delivering today and investing for the future. We're not trying to optimize margins in a particular quarter or for that matter, in a year. We've got a track record, a disciplined track record of growing revenue faster than expense, but we're not going to do it in every quarter, in every business, and every quarter. And so, we see right opportunities to make investments that we think are going to create opportunities for us to deliver value for our clients. We're going to make them. Yes, it's not a market. I would suggest it's really a collection of markets. And what we saw in the third quarter was, on average, pretty similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. I would note, as it relates to our income statement, we have different levels of commission exposure to different products, right? So, it doesn't always add up to the same amount. But it's a mixed market, and maybe I'll ask Martin to share some thoughts. And just to remind everyone, it's our role is to get the best solution for our retail clients in the marketplace. And we have a role as a market maker, too. And so, we've done a few things as a market maker to try to bring more efficient financing solutions to our clients. Martin? Yes. Thanks, Martin. What I would also say, David, and I mentioned this to Jimmy, but clearly, the cost of risk is rising, right? So, whether it's a frequency of cat events, including extreme weather, casualty loss costs, whether it's core inflation, social inflation, some of the underwriting community referring to as legal system abuse, the growth in litigation funding, concerns for our clients for sure and the underwriting community as well. Thanks, David. Yes. Sure, Rob. Again, margins and outcome, it's not our primary objective. Our focus is on growing earnings and free cash flow over time. We're not trying to optimize margin expansion in any period, certainly in any business in any period. We do expect solid margin expansion in 2023, which will be our 16th consecutive year of margin expansion. There were FX headwinds in RIS' margins in the third quarter. But again, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made there. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, again, we expect good solid margin expansion in 2023. Sure, Rob. I'll ask Martine to comment in a second, but we've had good growth in our health and benefits business at Mercer in our business internationally, which is Mercer Marsh Benefits and at MMA. It is a pressure point, clearly, for our clients in this economy. And so, clients more and more looking to us for solutions there. Martine, maybe you could share some insights. Yes. Thanks, Meyer. I would say, as I said, obviously, the macro economy remains uncertain, and there is a fair amount of questions about it. What I would say is mature markets have relatively resilient, but inflation of cost persists Central banks are -- their primary mission is to reduce inflation. But we do see a meaningful risk of recession, and we're prepared for that sure. And some markets are in recession now. But I'll ask Nick, Martine, again, I think Oliver Wyman historically has been a bit more sensitive to GDP and Mercer's Career business has as well. But Nick, maybe you could share some thoughts on the economy and what you think that might mean to our business. Thank you, Nick. Martine, maybe you can share some thoughts on Mercer Career? Thanks, Martine. So, we, of course, Meyer, are not immune to economic growth, but we're a resilient business. And again, we have a track record of performing across economic cycles. And at the moment, demand remains strong. Do you have a follow-up? No, it's not less true. But again, keep in mind, Mercer had its best quarter of growth. It's a bigger business than Oliver Wyman and it's best quarter of growth in 15 years. So that's the reason you didn't see anything there. Yes, sure. Happy to talk about that, Scott. Again, very pleased with our growth at Marsh. It was particularly strong in the International segment in the quarter. And in spite of mixed economic outcomes in Europe, our business is performing exceptionally well there. And we've had good growth over a long period of time in Latin America. Martin, maybe you could share some color on growth in both of those markets. Thanks, Martin. Scott, do you have a follow-up? Sure. We remain quite active in the market and the pipeline remains solid for sure. And again, I just want to emphasize how pleased we were to welcome Grant to the family in the third quarter, and we expect to close Hanon relatively soon. They're two well-led businesses. Well positioned solid growth fundamentals in both of them, expanding our presence in the middle market, which gets back to the mix point that I was making earlier. So overall, we closed five deals in the quarter. Those were the two bigger ones. We're very excited about it. We're certainly -- it's an active marketplace. While there's fewer transactions, there's a lot that is at play. And so, we're wide out about and clear on what we're looking for. Valuations remain elevated for strong businesses that are in the market. But we know what we're looking for and we know how to manage the risk of M&A. And so, we're going to be selective and disciplined, but we expect to continue to deploy capital inorganically. Yes. Thanks, Bob. We're not going to comment on individual clients and the work that we do for individual clients. So as Nick talked about a couple of different times on this call, we have an increasingly diverse set of offerings that we think is more resilient, and we're very, very pleased with the growth at Oliver Wyman through three quarters. Again, quarter-to-quarter, we could see more volatility and expect to see more volatility at Oliver Wyman's top-line than our other businesses. But we also expect Oliver Wyman to grow faster over a medium term and longer term. And that's certainly been the case. That's been the case in this year, and we expect it to be the case over the longer term. Do you have a follow-up? Bob, what I -- again, the most important point to make here is it's our job to find efficient risk financing solutions for our clients. So, what I would say is, yes, there's been some major breaches that will drive some insured losses in the marketplace. There's also been an increase, again, in the number of ransomware claims that's -- that have happened during the course of this year. But I would also note that the underwriting community has reacted to growing ransomware claims over the course of the last couple of years through higher attachment points. The market is also -- the underwriting market is also reacting to possible systemic events that could aggregate losses in their portfolios. We're, of course, helping them at Guy Carpenter and at the same time, working with Marsh to build better solutions for that. But the market's been restricting coverage for systemic type events. And so that's a factor in that marketplace as well. And so, I don't think the market will move meaningfully based on a couple of losses. But we have some work to do collectively to help in a digital economy. When I say collectively, I mean the royal we, the entire marketplace, in coming up with better solutions to help clients manage the risks -- cyber-related risks in a digital economy. Thank you. Thanks, Ryan, for the question. Yes, I think Martin pointed this out. There's -- I can't talk about relative exposure. But clearly, capital market volatility, the rising cost of capital, M&A activity is down. IPO activity is down. SPACs are down. DSPACs down, all those kinds of things that drive risk and create opportunities for us to offer advice and solutions are under some pressure. And somewhat related to that, as Martin also noted earlier, pricing is down as well. And so those are headwinds. But again, we have a well-diversified business in the United States. We help our clients manage a wide range of risks. And broadly speaking, again, the cost of risk continues to rise for the factors that I mentioned earlier on the call. So, thank you, Ryan. I appreciate that, and I want to thank you all for joining us on the call. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you, all, very much, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

            "name": "Nick Studer",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and thank you, Jimmy. Yes, let me enlarge on that a little bit. It's definitely not an easy environment for discretionary spending in our clients. I still see a fairly wide range of possible economic paths. But John called out our wider resilience of Marsh McLennan, and I'm proud that Oliver Wyman has demonstrated that resilience and chlorine our way back from a flat to Q1. And as Martin said as well, we do try to look at the business on a year-over-year basis more than a quarter-over-quarter basis, but it does matter. We're quite a diverse business now, and we've been becoming more diverse. So, if you think about the sectors that are driving our growth in the regions, our India, Middle East and Africa region has been the biggest contributor to our regional growth with Europe also contributing strongly. On the sectoral side, public sector, which is quite present in the Middle East, our communications, media and technology practice followed by banking, followed by transportation and services. So again, quite a wide array of industry sectors there. And maybe just an interesting case study on the industry side would be our private equity, private capital practice. Clearly, it's not been a great deal environment. But that practice has been doing quite well, driven by portfolio company work. And over the last few years, I've said a few times and have been asked questions about our offerings through the cycle, which we've been seeking to broaden our economic research practices grew strongly, our digital team, our restructuring practice, which is nascent, grew very strongly. Our work on performance transformation with clients, which is more of a tough economic environment offering as well as our people in organizational performance work where we do a lot of collaboration with Mercer. So ultimately, I'm optimistic in our long-term growth prospects, but we continue to plan for mid to high single-digit growth over the longer term. And our pipeline is looking in line with that at this moment. Yes. Thank you, John. Thank you, Meyer. It's -- as I said earlier on, I think it is a wide range of economic paths that I see different of our sectors do react differently -- and some of our industries have been having a pretty tough time since sort of through and since the pandemic. Some have seen little spurts of growth. We've been growing in some sectors, for example, Aerospace and Defense, where we made a significant acquisition last year, which we see as being more robust through the cycle. I do think that a tough economic outlook tends to result in slower growth for Oliver Wyman. But as I said earlier, we've been trying to develop a wider set of through-the-cycle offerings. And sometimes when the questions all change, people need help answering them. So, it's definitely not a correlation anymore. I think it probably -- that correlation has declined over time and it's pretty low now."

            "name": "Martin South",
            "content": "Yes. Thank you, John. As you said, very strong growth for Marsh across the board in International and North America. As you said, we don't comment on specifically on MMA, but they've had a good quarter. The growth in the MGA business was strong. There's partly some impact from the capital markets and some moderating growth in financial construction, cyber lines reflecting some pricing pressures. But as you say, we don't look at this on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We look it over a longer period of time, and we feel very positive about the U.S. business and the Canadian business. Yes, I agree with that, John. That's our job. Just to level set, we're in the 24th consecutive quarter of rate increases. We'll release our survey in a couple of weeks' time. And I don't think we're at an inflection point when it comes to pricing. The pricing cycles we're seeing across the different geographies and product lines are beginning to show a mix of strengths and weaknesses depending on the combination. The third quarter Casualty grew at 3%. It grew in 3% the quarter before and the quarter before -- and the quarter before. So, we're not seeing an acceleration. But I would say we're hearing a lot more talk from carriers about pressures on pricing and social facing and some of the nuclear verdicts that are out there, and we're keeping our clients closely posted on those. Property was at 7%. These rates were roughly in line with the prior quarter. We saw some softness in FINPRO lines. FINPRO lines came down by 6% in the third quarter. They were down 8% in the quarter before. So, I don't think that's a trend yet, but it's certainly less. And as you mentioned in the introduction, John, our cyber index came down by 2%, and it was up by 1% in the quarter, so three percentage point delta between the courses. So, it's a relatively calm market that we'll see on casualty. I'd be thrilled to. Yes. As you say, great growth in international, 10%; Latin America, up 14%; APAC, 10%, EMEA, 9%. So really, really pleasing growth. I'd say there are a few areas that are outstanding at the moment, the energy and power business, the transition is fueling growth. Credit Specialties had a terrific quarter in aviation, as well as MMB, which is a big part of our business in Europe delivered strong double-digit growth. And our advisory business, our value proposition is to go to market through a lens to help our clients think through the cost of risk. And so that's been a big growth area for us as we think that, and we think that will continue to broaden our opportunities. That's been great growth. It's been good growth between renewal and new bid business across the business and we've had less lost business. The clients are staying with us longer as they see the value in an organization like ours that has such broad capabilities. So, we feel very good about that across the board. And of course, you've got the fundamentals in Latin America with protection gap and somewhat emerging markets in Eastern Europe as well that have had a very strong growth as well. So, we feel well positioned and very positive about the trajectory there."

Our third quarter results were outstanding, continued momentum in underlying growth, strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth and significant margin expansion. Our consolidated revenue increased 13% to $5.4 billion, with underlying growth of 10%. Operating income was $996 million and adjusted operating income was $1.1 billion, up 24% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 21.3%. GAAP EPS was $1.47 and adjusted EPS was $1.57, up 33% over last year. Note that adjusted EPS in the third quarter included a $0.10 discrete tax benefit from the release of the valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets. Even without this benefit, our adjusted EPS grew 25% in the quarter. For the first nine months of 2023, underlying revenue growth was 10%. Adjusted operating income grew 17% to $4.4 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points and adjusted EPS increased 17% to $6.31. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $3.2 billion, up 12% from a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis. This result marks the tenth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in nearly two decades. Operating income increased 21% to $640 million. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to $671 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 23.4%. For the first nine months of the year, revenue in RIS was $10.8 billion. With underlying growth of 12%, adjusted operating income increased 18% to $3.3 billion. Margin increased 150 basis points to 32.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 9% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 8% growth in the third quarter of last year. Growth in the third quarter reflected solid new business and strong retention. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 6% for the quarter, led by strong growth in MMA. In International, underlying growth was 10% and comes on top of 11% in the third quarter of last year. Latin America was up 14%. Asia Pacific was up 10% and EMEA grew 9%. For the first nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $8.5 billion, with underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada grew 7% and International was up 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $359 million in the quarter, up 9% or 8% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth across our global specialties and regions. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $2 billion of revenue, 10% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, third quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, up 13% from a year ago or 9% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $424 million. Adjusted operating income increased 24% to $447 million, and the adjusted operating margin expanded 170 basis points to 20.8%. For the first nine months of 2023, consulting revenue was $6.4 billion, with underlying growth of 7%. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $1.3 billion. The adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 20.1%. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 8% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's best quarter of underlying growth in 15 years. Wealth grew 7%, driven by continued demand in defined benefits consulting and higher growth in investment management. Our assets under management were $379 billion at the end of the third quarter, up 19% compared to the third quarter of last year and down 4% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transaction with Westpac, a rebound in capital markets, and positive net flows. Health underlying growth was 8% and reflected strength in all segments and regions. Career revenue increased 7%, on top of 15% growth in the third quarter of last year. We continue to see growth in rewards and talent strategy. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $4.1 billion, with 7% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $781 million, an increase of 12% on an underlying basis that reflected strength in the Middle East and Europe. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $2.3 billion, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis. Foreign exchange was a $0.01 headwind to EPS in the third quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX will have an immaterial effect on fourth quarter earnings. We reported $52 million of total restructuring costs in the quarter, approximately $37 million of which relates to the program we announced in the fourth quarter last year. These charges include costs related to severance, lease exits and streamlining our technology environment. We've continued to pursue efficiencies under this program, and our outlook for savings has increased. As John noted, we now expect total charges of $425 million to $475 million and expect total savings of roughly $400 million, of which approximately $225 million will be realized in 2023. To date, we have incurred approximately $325 million of charges under this program. We currently expect to incur the majority of the remaining charges by the end of 2023 and to realize the bulk of the remaining savings in 2024. Our other net benefit credit was $62 million in the quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $1 million in the third quarter on a GAAP basis and $2 million on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the third quarter was $145 million, up from $118 million in the third quarter of 2022, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $157 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the third quarter was 20.5% compared with 24.6% in the third quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. The largest discrete item this quarter was a $48 million release of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate of around 25.5% for 2023. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total debt of $13.6 billion. This includes the $1.6 billion of senior notes we issued in September. Our next scheduled debt maturities are in March 2024, when $1 billion of senior notes mature and in May, when another $600 million of senior notes come due. We also recently took the opportunity to increase borrowing capacity under our credit facility, increasing the size of the facility to $3.5 billion from $2.8 billion and extending the term of the facility by 2.5 years to 2028. This was a prudent step to increase our access to short-term funding given the significant growth in our business since we last renewed the facility in April 2021. We are also pleased that Moody's upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to A3 in September. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $2.9 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion, included $353 million for dividends, $368 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $2.9 billion and included $944 million for dividends, $1.1 billion for acquisitions, and $900 million for share repurchases. Overall, we remain on track for a terrific 2023. Based on our outlook today and assuming current conditions persist, we expect to generate 9% to 10% full-year underlying revenue growth, strong growth in adjusted EPS and to report margin expansion for the 16th consecutive year. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John."

            "content": "Yes. Thank you, Robert, for the question. Thank you, John. Indeed, medical inflation is increasing. And as John just said, it's an advantage for our clients. At the same time, it's not a big part of our revenue sources because a lot of our clients are on fee-based or those kinds of things. When -- we're also working a lot with clients to try to control those costs, control those increases. Because, as you may know, in the health benefit space, very, very often, employers would share the cost with the employee base. So, in this time of our inflation, they're pretty concerned about passing on those costs. So, we're looking at design of the plan, access in a different way, leveraging technology, et cetera. So, there's many different ways that our clients -- that we can help our clients address those increase in costs. And it's impacting revenue a little bit, but honestly, it's a small part for us given all of the counterpoints. Yes. absolutely. And over the last few years, we have focused also on diversifying our portfolio of businesses, and we've improved our business mix a little bit away from the more discretionary nature of the business, particularly in Career with more recurring type of work. And I would add to that, that with our -- with the current environment, there's also lots of demand, as Nick just said. You look at volatile capital markets, for example, drives demand for advice in our defined benefit and our different completion businesses well-funded, the fund benefit plan on the back of high interest rates and also creating demand for pension risk transfer. We talked about tight labor markets, the different -- the change in the ways of working, the upcoming of digital health and technology in the workplace. It's all driving demand and countering the more traditional, I would say, of previous year's impact of direct correlation to GDP, as we discussed earlier."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan\u2019s Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2023 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings included in our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions]. I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses; Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan second quarter results were excellent. We performed well across our businesses and geographies extended the best run of quarterly underlying revenue growth in over two decades and generated double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Top line momentum continued with 11% underlying revenue growth on top of 10% growth in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted operating income grew 17% versus a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022 and adjusted EPS grew 16%. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.71 and completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter. I'm pleased with our performance, especially when viewed in the context of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. While the U.S. and other major economies have been resilient, there remain significant uncertainty given persistent inflation, continued central bank tightening and geopolitical instability. However, we continue to perform well. As we have discussed in the past, there are factors that are supportive of our growth. We also have a track record of resilience and believe we are well positioned to perform across economic cycles. We manage our business to grow revenues faster than expenses in both good and challenging periods. We've made meaningful investments in market facing talent and improving sales operations and client engagement, which are contributing to our growth. And we continue to deliberately shift our business mix to faster growth areas. So, while the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains volatile, we see opportunity to deliver greater value to clients through our leadership and capabilities in risk, strategy and people. A good example is Marsh McLennan's work to aid Ukraine's economy. Our four businesses together are mobilizing our unique expertise to support their future recovery and reconstruction efforts. In June, I attended the Ukrainian recovery conference hosted by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. We have the honor of hosting a delegation of Ukrainian and British officials at our London offices where we announced proposals to help with Ukraine's recovery. Some estimates suggest over $1 trillion may be required for this effort. Yet investment capital will not be forthcoming until investors can protect themselves from war risk. To this end, we propose to Ukraine and the G7, the creation of a war risk insurance pool that would ensure commercial insurance is available for reconstruction projects. We also announced that we will partner with the Ukrainian government and insurers to create a data platform for the assessment of war risks. This project draws on Marsh McLennan's expertise and leverages data and information provided by the Ukrainians. By enabling effective and targeted risk modeling, it represents a critical first step for the industry to offer commercial insurance and unlock capital. Our colleagues at Oliver Wyman also partnered with the Ukrainian government to develop a post war transformation strategy. This would reposition Ukraine's economy in a way that leverages national strengths to move beyond resilience to opportunity. At Marsh McLennan, we consider it a privilege to support these endeavors. Now I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the strategic initiatives we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we appointed new leaders for Marsh McLennan International and U.S. and Canada as well as region and country leaders. These leaders are driving client impact through enhanced collaboration, while at the same time maintaining the individual value propositions of the businesses. We are bringing our collective capabilities where there is opportunity to provide greater value. This allows us to harness the benefits of our scale, data, insights and expertise to meet our client\u2019s challenges and realize possibilities. This approach is already yielding benefits and improving the client and colleague experience. At the same time, we are also finding new ways to operate, reduce complexity and organize for impact. The actions we are taking aim to realign our workforce and skill sets with evolving needs, rationalized technology, and reduce our real estate footprint. As we said last quarter, we expect roughly $300 million of total savings by 2024 with total cost to achieve these savings of $375 million to $400 million. Our go-to-market collaboration and restructuring actions are an opportunity to drive higher growth, enhance the colleague value proposition and be more efficient and connected. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, primary insurance rate increases continued with the Marsh Global Insurance market index up 3% overall versus 4% in the first quarter. Property rates increased 10% the same as last quarter. Casualty pricing was up in the low single-digit range. Workers' compensation was down low single-digits and financial and professional liability insurance rates were down high single digits. Cyber insurance pricing stabilized after several years of increases. In reinsurance, challenging market conditions persisted at mid-year renewals. Reinsurers were disciplined and rate increases remained significant, although the market showed more interest in deploying capacity than at January 1, given the firm pricing and improved terms. Global property cat reinsurance risk adjusted rates increased about 30% on average with loss impacted clients seeing higher pricing. The impact of rate increases on ceded premiums was mitigated by higher retentions. On the casualty side, pricing pressure continued across most lines driven by prior year loss development and concerns about social and economic inflation. We continue to help clients manage these dynamic market conditions. Now let me turn to our second quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.20 which is up 16% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 11%. Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 8% in consulting. Marsh was up 10%, Guy Carpenter 11% versus 6% and Oliver Wyman grew 11%. Overall, the second quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 17% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points year-over-year. For the six months, consolidated revenue grew 10% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 15% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $4.74 up 13% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we are well positioned for a strong year in 2023. In terms of revenue outlook, given our momentum, we expect full-year underlying revenue growth to be high single-digits. This reflects a continuation of current trends, but as we noted, the macro outlook remains uncertain and can turn out to be different than our assumptions. As for the bottom-line outlook, we continue to expect margin expansion for the full-year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Overall, I'm proud of our second quarter performance, which demonstrates our continued execution on strategic initiatives and momentum across our business despite an uncertain macro environment. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they delivered to our clients, shareholders and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our second quarter results were outstanding with continued momentum in underlying growth, mid-teens adjusted EPS growth and solid margin expansion. Our consolidated revenue increased 9% to $5.9 billion with underlying growth of 11%. Operating income was $1.5 billion and adjusted operating income was also $1.5 billion up 17%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 27.7% a good result given the headwinds from the talent investments we made in 2022, the timing of our annual raises and the continued rebound in expenses such as T&E that we mentioned last quarter. GAAP EPS was $2.07 and adjusted EPS was $2.20 up 16% over last year. For the first six months of 2023, underlying revenue growth was 10%. Our adjusted operating income grew 15% to $3.3 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points and our adjusted EPS increased 13% to $4.74. Looking at risk and insurance services, second quarter revenue was $3.7 billion up 12% compared with a year ago, or 13% on an underlying basis. This result marks the ninth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in nearly two decades. Operating income increased 20% to $1.2 billon. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $1.2 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 34.2%. For the first six months of the year, revenue in RIS was $7.6 billion with underlying growth of 12%. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $2.6 billion and the margin increased 170 basis points to 36.4%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $3 billion up 9% from a year ago or 10% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 9% growth in the second quarter of last year. Growth in the second quarter reflected strong new business and excellent retention. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 9% for the quarter. In international, underlying growth was 10% and comes on top of 9% in the second quarter of 2022. Latin America was up 17%, EMEA was up 11% and Asia Pacific grew 6%. For the first six months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $5.8 billion with underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada grew 8% and international was up 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $576 million in the quarter, up 10% or 11% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth across all regions and global specialties. For the first six months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.6 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion up 4% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $388 million. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $403 million. The adjusted operating margin was 19.2% compared to 19.3% in the second quarter of last year. For the first six months of 2023, Consulting revenue was $4.2 billion representing underlying growth of 6% and adjusted operating income increased 5% to $809 million. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis, representing the ninth consecutive quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth in Mercer. Wealth grew 3% driven by continued strength in defined benefits. Investment management also delivered modest growth. Our assets under management were $393 billion at the end of the second quarter up 11% sequentially and 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. Growth was driven by a modest rebound in capital markets, positive net flows and our transaction with Westpac. Health underlying growth was 10% and reflected strength in all segments and regions. Career revenue increased 6% on top of 17% growth in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see demand for rewards, talent strategy and workforce transformation advice and solutions. With first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.7 billion with 7% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $798 million, an increase of 11% on an underlying business and reflected continued strength in the Middle East and Europe and a rebound in the Americas. With first six months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.5 billion, an increase of 6% on an underlying basis. Foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.01 headwind in the third quarter and a $0.01 benefit in the fourth quarter. We reported $65 million of total restructuring costs in the quarter, approximately $50 million of which relates to the program we announced in the fourth quarter. These charges include costs related to severance, lease exits and streamlining our technology environment. We continue to expect total charges under this program to be $375 million to $400 million. To date, we\u2019ve incurred approximately $300 million of charges and currently expect to incur most of the remaining costs in 2023. We still expect to achieve total savings of roughly $300 million by 2024, and now expect to realize approximately $200 million in 2023. Our other net benefit credit was $60 million in the quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $3 million in the second quarter on a GAAP basis and $2 million on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the second quarter was $146 million up from $140 million in the second quarter of 2022. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on short term borrowings, which we use for efficient working capital management. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $142 million of interest expense in the third quarter and approximately $567 million for the full year. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 24.2% compared with 23.7% in the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. The largest discrete item this quarter was the accounting for share-based compensation. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $12.6 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is October 2023, when $250 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. Last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% marking our 14th consecutive year of dividend growth. This increase, the largest in 25 years reflects our strong earnings growth over the past couple of years, confidence in our outlook. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1.2 billion. Usage of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion and included $295 million for dividends, $421 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases. The first six months, uses of cash totaled $1.9 billion and included $591 million for dividends, $701 million for acquisitions and $600 million for share repurchases. Given our strong results in the first half, we now expect high-single-digit underlying revenue growth for the full year. We continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. This guidance is based on our outlook today, but as John mentioned, there continues to be uncertainty in the environment looking forward. So outcomes could be different than our current assumptions. Overall, our excellent start leaves us well-positioned for another great year in 2023. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to, John.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, you guys updated your organic growth guidance for the full year to high-single-digits. You guys started-off the year pretty strong at 10% organic growth through the first six months. So, trying to get a sense, as you think about the back half, what businesses might you expect to see some kind of moderation in right to get the high-single-digits for the full year? And then embedded within that guide, what are you assuming for fiduciary investment income in the back half of the year?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Good morning, Elyse. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're -- as I said, I\u2019m quite pleased with the growth year-to-date, and the macro environment although volatile remains supportive of good strong growth, inflation, pricing, tight labor markets, our tailwinds. But, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we've been shifting our mix of business to better growth markets. We've been investing in talent, sales operations, client engagement. We've sold some non-core businesses and recently announced the sale of a non-core business. So, we've been working very hard at the growth profile of the company. And, our outlook remains quite positive. So, we upped our guidance to high-single-digits, it\u2019s again a terrific start of the year. I feel like we're well-positioned. Our team is executing very well in the marketplace, and in spite of the volatile macro environment, I think we'll have a good second half of growth as well. We're not going to give specific guidance on fiduciary income, but you saw what it looked like in the second quarter, obviously meaningful growth and we expect that to likely continue in the second half.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. And then my second question is on margin. You guys had pointed right that the Q2 would see lower improvement than the other quarters of the year. Does that still stand and when you expect margin improvement to pick up in the Q3 and the Q4, and with the higher expense savings now $200 million this year, does the higher savings in 2023, do those all come in the back half or was that spread throughout the year?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes, I'll ask Mark to talk about the restructuring program, but I was very pleased with the margin improvement in the quarter and year-to-date 100 bps in the second quarter, 130 bps year-to-date. And, just a reminder for everyone, margins and outcome for us, it's not the primary objective, but we do expect to grow revenue more than expense over time, and we're constantly trying to balance with delivering today and investing for the future. I think we're getting that balance right. Our growth in both topline and earnings shows that. We did guide to less improvement in the second quarter, Mark talked about in his prepared remarks some of the drivers behind that. But again, I'm quite pleased with where we are. We expect solid margin expansion again for the 16th year. And, Mark, maybe you can talk about the restructuring program.\nMark McGivney: Yes. Hi, Elyse, how are you? Elyse, you see that we did take up the outlook for this year to $200 million but left the overall at $300 million. It just reflects the fact that we're executing well, and we've just gotten added a little bit quicker. And as we said last quarter, wouldn't be a bad assumption just to assume the savings comes in ratably across the year. And, I would say the same thing. It's just that we've gotten at the savings a little bit quicker. So, I would just assume a ratable spreading over course of the year as opposed to all the increase coming in the back half.\nJohn Q. Doyle: And we do have a bit of better second half comps from the expense -- on the expense line. So, thank you, Elyse. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. First, just a question on revenues in the RIS business, you've grown at a pretty fast rate the last several quarters and I think generally better than some of your larger peers, and part of that might have been just the benefit from the hiring activity that you've done over the past couple of years. Is the tailwind from that fully reflected in your results and has it fully ramped up or is there sort of more to go there?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Jimmy. As I said, we\u2019re quite pleased with our growth, pick up one of your words just a benefit from some hiring. As I noted, we've been working quite hard at shifting the mix of business, bringing in talent, improving our sales operations, including -- investing in client engagement, we made terrific inorganic investments as well. And so, it's much more than some of the lateral hiring that's in the market. Having said that, we were quite pleased with the hiring we did, and we've gotten good returns from those investments. And, as I pointed out in the past not just -- we've not just been pleased with the financial outcome. Culturally, we were very thoughtful about, who we brought into the organization and they're not only helping us grow, but they're making us better as well. So, we're quite pleased with those investments.\nJimmy Bhullar: And then just you mentioned -- sorry, go ahead.\nJohn Q. Doyle: No, I'm sorry, do you have a follow-up?\nJimmy Bhullar: Yes, I was just going to say you mentioned macro and geopolitical a bunch of times and geopolitical obviously is understandable. Macro, from the outside and it seems like most of the factors are tailwinds more than they\u2019re headwinds, the equity market strong, inflation's high, GDP growth is held in. So, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on what is it that on the macro side that you see as a negative and specifically on inflation, if it stays elevated, is that -- obviously, it's a positive on your growth, but is it a positive on your earnings as well overall or is the benefit offset by just higher expenses in your own business?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes, it's a good question. I was trying to thread the needle a bit, right? I mean, again, the economy has been quite resilient, but inflation remains persistent. You're obviously beginning to see it come down here in the United States, but not at the level that the central bank seems to be targeting, with their mission to reduce inflation, that's going to have an impact on not just the market here, but in other markets. And so, I think there is still a meaningful risk of recession. And in fact, where we do have exposure in other parts of the world we have economies, in recession currently. So -- but I think you had it right, I think nominal GDP is a better indicator of demand for us rather than real GDP and -- excuse me and inflation, overall, we do think is beneficial to the company. We're not again immune to some of the challenges that we confront from an inflationary environment in our expenses, but overall, it's a bit of a benefit. And I would say, well, while equity markets, you pointed out equity markets have improved year-over-year, we've had some headwinds in our investment business from a growth perspective. Although, we're pleased with what's an improving growth profile year-to-date in Mercer investments. Thank you, Jimmy. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, great. First question, maybe I'll try to ask the Jimmy's question differently. So, in the RIS segment specifically, organic growth much stronger than consensus expectations, which is great. Any way you can offer any thoughts on whether a material portion of that kind of excess growth was market share taking versus just the entire maybe overall market conditions for the entire industry were stronger than maybe some expected?\nJohn Q. Doyle: It's a mix of impacts, of course. So, it's difficult to say, with real precision, Mike. But again, you've started to see inflation come down here in the United States. You saw -- and in many markets you're seeing GDP growth slow, P&C pricing moderated a bit in the quarter as well, tight labor markets though remain a positive factor. And overall, at least compared to the 2010 to 2020 decade, it's certainly -- we have more tailwinds than headwinds. But again, we've been working quite aggressively to shift our mix and to improve the growth profile of the company and not just be a passive index candidly on GDP or for that matter P&C pricing. So again, we're pleased -- I forgot to mention when, Jimmy asked the question too, I talked about the economy a bit, but the geopolitical environment remains a risk as well, right? So again, just trying to thread the needle between what's been obviously a terrific first half of the year and what we think is a terrific outlook for revenue growth in the second half, but there's macro risk as well.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. My follow ups on -- if you look at cash flow from operations, net of CapEx, if I'm doing the math right, it looks like it's growing at a pretty big clip. Do you expect free cash flow at this point to grow faster than earnings and any comments, if that's the case, your cash flow conversion will take a step up this year?\nJohn Q. Doyle: It could be a bit lumpier than earnings growth as we pointed out in the past and have demonstrated in the past, but maybe I'll ask, Mark to talk about the outlook for free cash flow growth.\nMark McGivney: Yes, thanks Mike. I -- we've, as I consistently say, we really try not to emphasize focusing too much on free cash flow growth in any quarter or even a year, it can be really volatile. Yes, as you point out in the second quarter, free cash flow was up quite nicely. If there is, we have to be careful especially early in the year for us, because it\u2019s a bit of a low base issue, with our cash flows tend to be lower early in the year, as you know then later in the year. But look, we've had a terrific run over a long period time of double digit free cash flow growth that has tracked pretty closely to our run of double-digit earnings growth last decade and as we've talked about, we're confident in our outlook for continued strong earnings growth and what we would expect that our free cash flow growth in the future would track that as well.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just thinking about the Marsh business, and I realize growth has been strong both domestically and internationally. But, if you look at those domestically and internationally, if you look at those two areas over the next say, the next year and the next five years, which are you most excited about?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Well, we're not going to give revenue guidance past, what we've given today past this year. But as I said, we're performing well. We're well-positioned. I think we have the best talent in the market, and I do believe we are capturing share, but maybe I'll ask, Martin to talk a little bit about the growth, so far this year and what you see for the rest of the year. Martin?\nMartin South: Thanks, John. As we said, we had a great strong organic growth of 10% in the second quarter, which is on top of 9%, which we posted in the second quarter of \u201922, and better than full year growth of 8%. As you said, great balance international was 10%, Latin America is 17%, EMEA 11%, APAC 6%, U.S. and Canada 9%. I'd say the growth has been, it\u2019s a really nice balance across all the geographies. The specialties growth was strong. Credit specialties, construction, aviation, energy and power strong, our advisory business, part of the risk advisor of the future, very strong double-digit growth. MMB was strong. Renewal growth was strong. So, it's just a nice mix of business across the board, both new business and renewal.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Martin. And again, the consistency of growth has been just outstanding in addition to the total. Do you have a follow-up, Rob?\nRobert Cox: Yes, thanks. And so maybe switching to Oliver Wyman, growth came in well above the levels you guys had guided from last quarter. And there have been a number of positive economic data points as of late, do you see the pipeline reflecting that? And is it looking like growth in the back half?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes, we're \u2013 thanks Rob. We\u2019re very pleased with the growth at Oliver Wyman. I'll ask Nick to talk a bit more about in detail. Nick?\nNick Studer: Yes, thank you, Robert. We still see a relatively wide range of possible future outcomes. When we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter. That was based on what we saw in our sales pipeline, which was ticking up nicely, but not aggressively. In the second quarter, we saw quite strong growth in sales. It's a, I would say, a reflection on places where Oliver Wyman\u2019s being selected to support our clients really transformative moments led by our public sector practice, led by our banking practice, transportation and services and our telco teams. And then also some of our other businesses, our economic research consulting nearer and our brand consulting business, Lippincott showing strong growth and our digital practice is showing strong growth. So, I wouldn't say yet that it's correlated with economic uptick. Clients need to use this for that performance transformation as well as for their growth strategy. But sales in the second quarter have been better than we've expected and in the near term, I'm relatively optimistic. And the longer term, the economic outcomes are still fairly widely ranged.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thank you, Nick. Operator, do we have a follow-up?\nRobert Cox: I'm sorry. Next question actually that was the follow-up.\nOperator: Question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just had another question on the increased outlook to high single-digit for the year. Just sort of high-level question. Was that improved outlook more function of the results you've achieved to-date or has your outlook improved at all going forward?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thanks, David for the question. It\u2019s really a function of both, right? We've had again a terrific start to the year, very, very pleased with the growth. And again, not just growth in parts of the business, just broad based, good execution and a lot of hard work by the team and really a reflection of the value that we're creating for clients. And so, we remain positive with that outlook. And again, geopolitical environment particularly but also the macroeconomic outlook or there's volatility there. So, we want to be mindful of that, but we feel very good about the second half.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And maybe just a question on Mercer career. So, I saw that decelerated a little bit, the growth decelerated, and the compare wasn't that much harder than the first quarter. So, I'm just wondering is there anything that you're seeing there on the pipeline front or just anything that would indicate that any clouds on the horizon?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes, thanks David. We love what we're doing at Mercer careers. Let me ask Martine to talk about our results here to-date.\nMartine Ferland: Yes. Thanks, David for the question. And you touched on it. The quarter growth this quarter was on top of challenging 17% comparable for the second quarter of last year. Our quarter at 6% in Q2 now has also been impacted by the delay of start of certain projects. But I would say that the fundamentals for the business remain very strong. We have 9% growth year-to-date. The demand for service continues, our clients still grapple with labor shortages, wage inflation, dealing with new ways of working, tech in the workplace. We discussed generative AI with the clients. So, you're right, it's also a business that has the largest opponent the discretionary compliance for us at Mercer and we are always watching the macroeconomics. But I would say at this point, our sales, our pipeline, client sentiments, very strong. So it continues to give us good visibility into strength for the third quarter and beyond. So, I\u2019m confident that the rest of the year will be good for career.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thanks, Martine. Thanks, David. Operator, next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi.\nMichael Ward: Thanks. Good morning. You called out global specialty in Guy Carpenter. Just wondering if you can discuss some of those trends and maybe the runway and how significant those impacts are?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Sure. Thanks, Mike for the question. Maybe I'll ask Dean we're quite pleased with our execution of what's been a very, very challenging reinsurance market in the first half of this year. But Dean, maybe you can talk about the growth of GC.\nDean Klisura: Sure. Thanks, John. We're very pleased with our 11% underlying growth in the quarter, 10% for the first half of the year. As you call out, we've seen strong growth across all of our regions in particular internationally and global specialties. Global specialties plays deeply in the retrocession capital market based in London and globally and there's been some capital challenges. Despite that, we've seen some capital inflow into the marketplace. But despite market conditions, our global specialty team continues to grow and perform impressively. New business across Guy Carpenter continues to accelerate. Some of that's from all the talent that we hired we're winning in the marketplace. We're seeing very strong demand in this marketplace for analytics platform. Which we think is the best in the marketplace. Demand for our advice and solutions remains strong. I mean our clients are really experiencing and seeing a flight to quality works in a challenging market environment where capital is still constrained where reinsurers are driving really challenging terms and conditions, you want to be with the best. I think also Guy Carpenter securities is differentiating in the marketplace. We did over 20 cap bond deals in the first half of the year with some of that new ILS capital coming into the marketplace. We've done ILS structuring for key clients. And so, I think there's just kind of real momentum in the business kind of globally. And of course, the market continues to be a tailwind. There's not enough new capital in the marketplace to change the trajectory of the pricing environment.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thank you, Dean. Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about the growth in specialties?\nMartin South: Yes. Thank you, John. As I mentioned earlier, that where we've seen really good growth in specialty areas being in the credit specialties, maybe not surprising given what's happening in the environment. Construction has been very strong internationally. Aviation and energy and power as those go through transition there and aviation is bounced back. So, feeling very good about that a little so take it with the advisory business as well where we -- the two businesses hang together. We're advising clients increasingly on how to manage that lost cost had to drive growth during the energy transition and so forth. So, all of those specialty areas we're seeing really strong growth and momentum and that's how we go to market. That's how we differentiate ourselves through that lens.\nJohn Q. Doyle: And in a world where the cost of risk is continuing to escalate our efforts to on risk consulting are really important to our clients and driving a lot of value, Mike. I also want to point out, it's obviously been particularly on the reinsurance side of late. But after several years of pricing increases, of course, at Marsh as well. It's a difficult market. We take our role as a market maker quite seriously. And in the quarter, announced a couple of different things that I would point out a multiline facility in London that we call fast track for our clients at Marsh. And then we also created a reciprocal inside of our MGA operations at Victor, as well trying to bring new solutions to what is a difficult market for clients. Do you have a follow-up, Mike?\nMichael Ward: Thank you. Yes, that was super helpful. Maybe last quarter you spoke a little bit about developing counter cyclical products in Oliver Wyman. I\u2019m just wondering if you can share some examples on that.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes, Nick, you want to talk about some of the capabilities we've been building inside of Oliver Wyman?\nNick Studer: Yes, I mean, there are various of our sectors which are perhaps less exposed to the cycles. So, last year you saw we acquired the excellent Avascent business, which is aerospace and defence specialist as an example. So, some of our sectors we've been trying to position ourselves carefully through the cycle. And then on the capabilities side, we do a very large amount of work now in performance transformation. And that's not solely a downturn-oriented solution but it's needed when clients are going through either margin squeeze on the top line or the bottom line. And then a couple of years ago, we started to build a restructuring practice, it's still very nascent, but we've seen very strong growth in that area as well. So that's just a few different examples. I think the final point I'd make is that really from the pandemic onwards, we've seen a reduction in the correlation between our different industries. Some have been in downturn for quite a long time, some are working through their own sort of mini crises, which sometimes requires advisory support. And then some are quite cyclical, but I'd note that our private equity private capital practice, which obviously slowed considerably over the last three or four quarters has started to pick up and we're seeing activity there both pre and post feel. So that's a sort of bit of a picture across the business.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Mike, for the questions. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nWeston Bloomer: This is Weston Bloomer on for Brian. My first question is a follow-up on Oliver Wyman, obviously strong growth there. And you highlighted a few subsectors that saw the growth. I'm curious within financial services and banking, was any of that growth driven by the banking turmoil that we saw earlier in the year or more one-off opportunities? I guess I'm going with that too. Is that something that you think could play out in the back half of this year or 2024 just given the turmoil earlier in the year?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thanks, Weston. And good question. Nick, maybe you could talk a little bit about -- you mentioned banking being a strength to-date, but maybe you could talk about the outlook.\nNick Studer: Yes, there were different puts and takes in our growth numbers, but perhaps 35% to 40% of our growth was driven by our banking practice. As you know, that is really a preeminent business for us. And at the beginnings of that, crisis. We felt that was just adding to uncertainty may lead to some pauses in decisions which may slow down the pipeline. In the second quarter, we did see some work coming through from it. It's hard to separate out exactly how much is driven by crisis response versus banks preparing to get ahead of capabilities that they now know they need given the very different interest rate environment. There are a lot of the core essentials of the banking system, our muscles that haven't had to be used in the very low-rate environment we've had for a very, very long time. And so, there is work on liability management, interest rate risk management, deposit management, the value of the branch network. Not to mention tuning ourselves up for the new tech and AI capabilities that might be helpful. But yes, we have seen that be a driver of some business already and we continue to expect that over the coming quarters.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thanks, Nick. -- Yes. Go ahead.\nWeston Bloomer: And you highlighted that 35% to 40% of growth was driven within financial services. Have you given a real thumb, I'd always assume that financial services was the largest subsector within OI? Just want to confirm that that's the case or if you've given a breakout there?\nNick Studer: We don't give a breakout. I mean, it's one of our strongest practices. It's also one of the largest sectors in management consulting globally. But it's, yes, one of our strength areas.\nWeston Bloomer: Got it. And then just one more within Guy Carpenter. Can you talk about the dynamic versus treaty versus FAC placements? In the kind of the growth outlook that you're seeing there. Are there more opportunities within FAC given just changes in buying or buyer behaviour?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thanks, Weston. We've seen good growth in fact over the course of the last couple of years, both seated and client driven FAC, Oliver Wyman and excuse me, Guy Carpenter and Marsh work quite closely together to capture that opportunity and to make sure we're bringing all the available capital all over the world to our clients to help again navigate what's been a very, very difficult marketplace. So, the growth has been quite strong in both FAC and in treaty as well. Thank you, Weston. Operator, next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.\nPaul Newsome : Good morning. Thanks for squeeze me in. I didn't think I heard much of anything about the M&A environment. I think we're all sort of waiting things to change their versus the --because of the interest rate environment changes, but any updated thoughts on M&A and how you see new environment there for yourself?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes, sure, Paul. We remain quite active in the market and have a solid pipeline. We're, of course, we continue to look for businesses with solid growth fundamentals that are well led and terrific talent and not only will they make us better, but hopefully we think we can make them better as well. I'd say the pipeline is pretty broad from both an RAS and consulting perspective. We of course did a big deal in Mercer investments on the 1st of April, so we're excited about that in Australia. We were just in Australia as a team. So excited about the acquisition there and what it means to our investments. The market obviously the number of deals was down. Some buyers, primarily financial buyers are sitting it out at the moment, but strategic players are still quite active. And what I would say, demand is strong. For higher quality businesses that are out there. And so, while obviously the cost of capital has increased quite a bit. Priced assets are still trading at a premium. So, but again, we're excited about what's possible there. We've worked very hard and have built a very strong reputation as a buyer in the market and that creates a lot of opportunity for us. Do you have a follow-up, Paul?\nPaul Newsome : Yes. As a follow-up, could you talk about the divestitures that you've made and how important or maybe not important they are to the margin improvements over the last quarter or last year. I mean, I know they're small in size.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Yes. No, thanks. Sorry to jump in on you there. They are relatively modest in size, but we are being thoughtful about the portfolio in that respect. And for the most part, they've happened at Mercer. Again, we recently announced the divestiture of what really is an admin business primarily or really entirely an admin business. And so not core, lower growth, capital intensive, operations and candidly, there are better owners of assets like that than us, others that can bring greater scale and technology and solutions. So, we don't expect to do a lot of it, but where we see the opportunity and it makes us better and stronger and enables us to invest in our core, we'll take steps to do that. Thank you, Paul. Operator. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jing Li with KBW.\nJing Li : Hi there. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a question on Asia Pacific business. Can you add some color on -- since I see that just a rate of some for this quarter? So, do you expect it to continue for the coming quarters?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Sure, Jing. Maybe I'll ask Martin to talk about it, but we're very excited about the possibility for growth in Asia and in the Pacific, not just that Marsh, but across our businesses as I mentioned as a leadership team, we're recently in Australia and we see lots of possibilities. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about the quarter and your outlook.\nMartin South: Okay. I think the important thing when we look at international, we like to look at growth over longer periods of time. With regard to APAC 6% underlying growth in the quarter. It's 8% year-to-date. We think that's much more indicative of what the growth would be like over a longer period of time. Likewise, we probably have slightly elevated growth in Latin America, we'd expect that to normalize over a period of time as well. So, I just think it's something that we're not worried about. We have a great business in Asia Pac and feel very confident about the future.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Lots of opportunities. It's one of the parts of the world where there's a meaningful protection gap. So, Jing, do you have a follow-up?\nJing Li : Yes. So, for this quarter, 6% I guess. So, you mean you guys mean it's kind of like a one-time thing. So, continue to be a double-digit kind of going forward?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Sure. Yes, we're not going to give specific guidance on Asia Pacific underlying revenue growth, but we do think it's an area, a region that we're very well positioned for strong growth going forward as we speak. As Martin mentioned, we're well positioned in that market. We've got terrific distribution throughout most major countries throughout the region and we're excited about it. It's one of the ways in which JLT made us quite stronger. So, thank you, Jing. Operator, are there any more questions?\nOperator: I'm showing no questions at the moment. [Operator Instructions].\nJohn Q. Doyle: Operator, we can wrap up if there are no more questions.\nOperator: I'm showing we do have a question, a follow-up.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Okay.\nOperator: One moment, please. Our follow-up question comes from Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: Hey, just one follow-up on the M&A spec and capital markets activity. Can you give us a sense of whether that continued maybe just directionally if that was more or less of a headwind in this quarter versus the first quarter?\nJohn Q. Doyle: Sure. Maybe I'll ask Martine to unpack our growth at Mercer Investments a bit, Martine?\nMartine Ferland: Yes, absolutely. I mean, our OCIO business is grown really rapidly over the last few years. But as you know, it's been impacted by capital markets over the last many quarters. Although it does benefit from net AUM inflows, some of that volatility does drive demand for the OCIO service, What we've seen in Q2 is still a small drag due to year-over-year capital market, but based on the value that we see at the end of the quarter, it bodes well for the rest of the year small accretive growth from capital markets for Q3 as far as we can see from levels today. So, this is a good business for us. It\u2019s about diversified portfolio, the volatility in the equipment market has come down. On the bond market, it's still a little bit elevated. But all of that has contributed to lower need on the client side for advice regarding the volatility, the funding of their pension plans, etcetera. It's been good for us and for our clients have been finding new ways to deal with the environment.\nJohn Q. Doyle: Thank you, Martine, and thanks Rob for the follow-up. I want to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. So, thank you all very much and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator, thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John Q. Doyle",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses; Martin South of Marsh, Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter, Martine Ferland of Mercer, and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan second quarter results were excellent. We performed well across our businesses and geographies extended the best run of quarterly underlying revenue growth in over two decades and generated double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Top line momentum continued with 11% underlying revenue growth on top of 10% growth in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted operating income grew 17% versus a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022 and adjusted EPS grew 16%. We also raised our quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.71 and completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter. I'm pleased with our performance, especially when viewed in the context of the current macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. While the U.S. and other major economies have been resilient, there remain significant uncertainty given persistent inflation, continued central bank tightening and geopolitical instability. However, we continue to perform well. As we have discussed in the past, there are factors that are supportive of our growth. We also have a track record of resilience and believe we are well positioned to perform across economic cycles. We manage our business to grow revenues faster than expenses in both good and challenging periods. We've made meaningful investments in market facing talent and improving sales operations and client engagement, which are contributing to our growth. And we continue to deliberately shift our business mix to faster growth areas. So, while the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment remains volatile, we see opportunity to deliver greater value to clients through our leadership and capabilities in risk, strategy and people. A good example is Marsh McLennan's work to aid Ukraine's economy. Our four businesses together are mobilizing our unique expertise to support their future recovery and reconstruction efforts. In June, I attended the Ukrainian recovery conference hosted by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. We have the honor of hosting a delegation of Ukrainian and British officials at our London offices where we announced proposals to help with Ukraine's recovery. Some estimates suggest over $1 trillion may be required for this effort. Yet investment capital will not be forthcoming until investors can protect themselves from war risk. To this end, we propose to Ukraine and the G7, the creation of a war risk insurance pool that would ensure commercial insurance is available for reconstruction projects. We also announced that we will partner with the Ukrainian government and insurers to create a data platform for the assessment of war risks. This project draws on Marsh McLennan's expertise and leverages data and information provided by the Ukrainians. By enabling effective and targeted risk modeling, it represents a critical first step for the industry to offer commercial insurance and unlock capital. Our colleagues at Oliver Wyman also partnered with the Ukrainian government to develop a post war transformation strategy. This would reposition Ukraine's economy in a way that leverages national strengths to move beyond resilience to opportunity. At Marsh McLennan, we consider it a privilege to support these endeavors. Now I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on the strategic initiatives we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we appointed new leaders for Marsh McLennan International and U.S. and Canada as well as region and country leaders. These leaders are driving client impact through enhanced collaboration, while at the same time maintaining the individual value propositions of the businesses. We are bringing our collective capabilities where there is opportunity to provide greater value. This allows us to harness the benefits of our scale, data, insights and expertise to meet our client's challenges and realize possibilities. This approach is already yielding benefits and improving the client and colleague experience. At the same time, we are also finding new ways to operate, reduce complexity and organize for impact. The actions we are taking aim to realign our workforce and skill sets with evolving needs, rationalized technology, and reduce our real estate footprint. As we said last quarter, we expect roughly $300 million of total savings by 2024 with total cost to achieve these savings of $375 million to $400 million. Our go-to-market collaboration and restructuring actions are an opportunity to drive higher growth, enhance the colleague value proposition and be more efficient and connected. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, primary insurance rate increases continued with the Marsh Global Insurance market index up 3% overall versus 4% in the first quarter. Property rates increased 10% the same as last quarter. Casualty pricing was up in the low single-digit range. Workers' compensation was down low single-digits and financial and professional liability insurance rates were down high single digits. Cyber insurance pricing stabilized after several years of increases. In reinsurance, challenging market conditions persisted at mid-year renewals. Reinsurers were disciplined and rate increases remained significant, although the market showed more interest in deploying capacity than at January 1, given the firm pricing and improved terms. Global property cat reinsurance risk adjusted rates increased about 30% on average with loss impacted clients seeing higher pricing. The impact of rate increases on ceded premiums was mitigated by higher retentions. On the casualty side, pricing pressure continued across most lines driven by prior year loss development and concerns about social and economic inflation. We continue to help clients manage these dynamic market conditions. Now let me turn to our second quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.20 which is up 16% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 11%. Underlying revenue grew 13% in RIS and 8% in consulting. Marsh was up 10%, Guy Carpenter 11% versus 6% and Oliver Wyman grew 11%. Overall, the second quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 17% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 100 basis points year-over-year. For the six months, consolidated revenue grew 10% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 15% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $4.74 up 13% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we are well positioned for a strong year in 2023. In terms of revenue outlook, given our momentum, we expect full-year underlying revenue growth to be high single-digits. This reflects a continuation of current trends, but as we noted, the macro outlook remains uncertain and can turn out to be different than our assumptions. As for the bottom-line outlook, we continue to expect margin expansion for the full-year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Overall, I'm proud of our second quarter performance, which demonstrates our continued execution on strategic initiatives and momentum across our business despite an uncertain macro environment. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they delivered to our clients, shareholders and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A. Good morning, Elyse. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're -- as I said, I'm quite pleased with the growth year-to-date, and the macro environment although volatile remains supportive of good strong growth, inflation, pricing, tight labor markets, our tailwinds. But, as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, we've been shifting our mix of business to better growth markets. We've been investing in talent, sales operations, client engagement. We've sold some non-core businesses and recently announced the sale of a non-core business. So, we've been working very hard at the growth profile of the company. And, our outlook remains quite positive. So, we upped our guidance to high-single-digits, it's again a terrific start of the year. I feel like we're well-positioned. Our team is executing very well in the marketplace, and in spite of the volatile macro environment, I think we'll have a good second half of growth as well. We're not going to give specific guidance on fiduciary income, but you saw what it looked like in the second quarter, obviously meaningful growth and we expect that to likely continue in the second half. Yes, I'll ask Mark to talk about the restructuring program, but I was very pleased with the margin improvement in the quarter and year-to-date 100 bps in the second quarter, 130 bps year-to-date. And, just a reminder for everyone, margins and outcome for us, it's not the primary objective, but we do expect to grow revenue more than expense over time, and we're constantly trying to balance with delivering today and investing for the future. I think we're getting that balance right. Our growth in both topline and earnings shows that. We did guide to less improvement in the second quarter, Mark talked about in his prepared remarks some of the drivers behind that. But again, I'm quite pleased with where we are. We expect solid margin expansion again for the 16th year. And, Mark, maybe you can talk about the restructuring program. And we do have a bit of better second half comps from the expense -- on the expense line. So, thank you, Elyse. Operator, next question? Yes. Thanks, Jimmy. As I said, we're quite pleased with our growth, pick up one of your words just a benefit from some hiring. As I noted, we've been working quite hard at shifting the mix of business, bringing in talent, improving our sales operations, including -- investing in client engagement, we made terrific inorganic investments as well. And so, it's much more than some of the lateral hiring that's in the market. Having said that, we were quite pleased with the hiring we did, and we've gotten good returns from those investments. And, as I pointed out in the past not just -- we've not just been pleased with the financial outcome. Culturally, we were very thoughtful about, who we brought into the organization and they're not only helping us grow, but they're making us better as well. So, we're quite pleased with those investments. No, I'm sorry, do you have a follow-up? Yes, it's a good question. I was trying to thread the needle a bit, right? I mean, again, the economy has been quite resilient, but inflation remains persistent. You're obviously beginning to see it come down here in the United States, but not at the level that the central bank seems to be targeting, with their mission to reduce inflation, that's going to have an impact on not just the market here, but in other markets. And so, I think there is still a meaningful risk of recession. And in fact, where we do have exposure in other parts of the world we have economies, in recession currently. So -- but I think you had it right, I think nominal GDP is a better indicator of demand for us rather than real GDP and -- excuse me and inflation, overall, we do think is beneficial to the company. We're not again immune to some of the challenges that we confront from an inflationary environment in our expenses, but overall, it's a bit of a benefit. And I would say, well, while equity markets, you pointed out equity markets have improved year-over-year, we've had some headwinds in our investment business from a growth perspective. Although, we're pleased with what's an improving growth profile year-to-date in Mercer investments. Thank you, Jimmy. Operator, next question? It's a mix of impacts, of course. So, it's difficult to say, with real precision, Mike. But again, you've started to see inflation come down here in the United States. You saw -- and in many markets you're seeing GDP growth slow, P&C pricing moderated a bit in the quarter as well, tight labor markets though remain a positive factor. And overall, at least compared to the 2010 to 2020 decade, it's certainly -- we have more tailwinds than headwinds. But again, we've been working quite aggressively to shift our mix and to improve the growth profile of the company and not just be a passive index candidly on GDP or for that matter P&C pricing. So again, we're pleased -- I forgot to mention when, Jimmy asked the question too, I talked about the economy a bit, but the geopolitical environment remains a risk as well, right? So again, just trying to thread the needle between what's been obviously a terrific first half of the year and what we think is a terrific outlook for revenue growth in the second half, but there's macro risk as well. It could be a bit lumpier than earnings growth as we pointed out in the past and have demonstrated in the past, but maybe I'll ask, Mark to talk about the outlook for free cash flow growth. Thank you, Mike. Operator, next question? Well, we're not going to give revenue guidance past, what we've given today past this year. But as I said, we're performing well. We're well-positioned. I think we have the best talent in the market, and I do believe we are capturing share, but maybe I'll ask, Martin to talk a little bit about the growth, so far this year and what you see for the rest of the year. Martin? Yes. Thanks, Martin. And again, the consistency of growth has been just outstanding in addition to the total. Do you have a follow-up, Rob? Yes, we're \u2013 thanks Rob. We're very pleased with the growth at Oliver Wyman. I'll ask Nick to talk a bit more about in detail. Nick? Thank you, Nick. Operator, do we have a follow-up? Thanks, David for the question. It's really a function of both, right? We've had again a terrific start to the year, very, very pleased with the growth. And again, not just growth in parts of the business, just broad based, good execution and a lot of hard work by the team and really a reflection of the value that we're creating for clients. And so, we remain positive with that outlook. And again, geopolitical environment particularly but also the macroeconomic outlook or there's volatility there. So, we want to be mindful of that, but we feel very good about the second half. Yes, thanks David. We love what we're doing at Mercer careers. Let me ask Martine to talk about our results here to-date. Thanks, Martine. Thanks, David. Operator, next question please. Sure. Thanks, Mike for the question. Maybe I'll ask Dean we're quite pleased with our execution of what's been a very, very challenging reinsurance market in the first half of this year. But Dean, maybe you can talk about the growth of GC. Thank you, Dean. Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about the growth in specialties? And in a world where the cost of risk is continuing to escalate our efforts to on risk consulting are really important to our clients and driving a lot of value, Mike. I also want to point out, it's obviously been particularly on the reinsurance side of late. But after several years of pricing increases, of course, at Marsh as well. It's a difficult market. We take our role as a market maker quite seriously. And in the quarter, announced a couple of different things that I would point out a multiline facility in London that we call fast track for our clients at Marsh. And then we also created a reciprocal inside of our MGA operations at Victor, as well trying to bring new solutions to what is a difficult market for clients. Do you have a follow-up, Mike? Yes, Nick, you want to talk about some of the capabilities we've been building inside of Oliver Wyman? Thank you, Nick. Thank you, Mike, for the questions. Operator, next question please? Thanks, Weston. And good question. Nick, maybe you could talk a little bit about -- you mentioned banking being a strength to-date, but maybe you could talk about the outlook. Thanks, Nick. -- Yes. Go ahead. Thanks, Weston. We've seen good growth in fact over the course of the last couple of years, both seated and client driven FAC, Oliver Wyman and excuse me, Guy Carpenter and Marsh work quite closely together to capture that opportunity and to make sure we're bringing all the available capital all over the world to our clients to help again navigate what's been a very, very difficult marketplace. So, the growth has been quite strong in both FAC and in treaty as well. Thank you, Weston. Operator, next question please? Yes, sure, Paul. We remain quite active in the market and have a solid pipeline. We're, of course, we continue to look for businesses with solid growth fundamentals that are well led and terrific talent and not only will they make us better, but hopefully we think we can make them better as well. I'd say the pipeline is pretty broad from both an RAS and consulting perspective. We of course did a big deal in Mercer investments on the 1st of April, so we're excited about that in Australia. We were just in Australia as a team. So excited about the acquisition there and what it means to our investments. The market obviously the number of deals was down. Some buyers, primarily financial buyers are sitting it out at the moment, but strategic players are still quite active. And what I would say, demand is strong. For higher quality businesses that are out there. And so, while obviously the cost of capital has increased quite a bit. Priced assets are still trading at a premium. So, but again, we're excited about what's possible there. We've worked very hard and have built a very strong reputation as a buyer in the market and that creates a lot of opportunity for us. Do you have a follow-up, Paul? Yes. No, thanks. Sorry to jump in on you there. They are relatively modest in size, but we are being thoughtful about the portfolio in that respect. And for the most part, they've happened at Mercer. Again, we recently announced the divestiture of what really is an admin business primarily or really entirely an admin business. And so not core, lower growth, capital intensive, operations and candidly, there are better owners of assets like that than us, others that can bring greater scale and technology and solutions. So, we don't expect to do a lot of it, but where we see the opportunity and it makes us better and stronger and enables us to invest in our core, we'll take steps to do that. Thank you, Paul. Operator. Next question. Sure, Jing. Maybe I'll ask Martin to talk about it, but we're very excited about the possibility for growth in Asia and in the Pacific, not just that Marsh, but across our businesses as I mentioned as a leadership team, we're recently in Australia and we see lots of possibilities. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about the quarter and your outlook. Lots of opportunities. It's one of the parts of the world where there's a meaningful protection gap. So, Jing, do you have a follow-up? Sure. Yes, we're not going to give specific guidance on Asia Pacific underlying revenue growth, but we do think it's an area, a region that we're very well positioned for strong growth going forward as we speak. As Martin mentioned, we're well positioned in that market. We've got terrific distribution throughout most major countries throughout the region and we're excited about it. It's one of the ways in which JLT made us quite stronger. So, thank you, Jing. Operator, are there any more questions? Operator, we can wrap up if there are no more questions. Okay. Sure. Maybe I'll ask Martine to unpack our growth at Mercer Investments a bit, Martine? Thank you, Martine, and thanks Rob for the follow-up. I want to thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. So, thank you all very much and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator, thank you."

            "content": "Sure. Thanks, John. We're very pleased with our 11% underlying growth in the quarter, 10% for the first half of the year. As you call out, we've seen strong growth across all of our regions in particular internationally and global specialties. Global specialties plays deeply in the retrocession capital market based in London and globally and there's been some capital challenges. Despite that, we've seen some capital inflow into the marketplace. But despite market conditions, our global specialty team continues to grow and perform impressively. New business across Guy Carpenter continues to accelerate. Some of that's from all the talent that we hired we're winning in the marketplace. We're seeing very strong demand in this marketplace for analytics platform. Which we think is the best in the marketplace. Demand for our advice and solutions remains strong. I mean our clients are really experiencing and seeing a flight to quality works in a challenging market environment where capital is still constrained where reinsurers are driving really challenging terms and conditions, you want to be with the best. I think also Guy Carpenter securities is differentiating in the marketplace. We did over 20 cap bond deals in the first half of the year with some of that new ILS capital coming into the marketplace. We've done ILS structuring for key clients. And so, I think there's just kind of real momentum in the business kind of globally. And of course, the market continues to be a tailwind. There's not enough new capital in the marketplace to change the trajectory of the pricing environment."

            "name": "Nick Studer",
            "content": "Yes, thank you, Robert. We still see a relatively wide range of possible future outcomes. When we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter. That was based on what we saw in our sales pipeline, which was ticking up nicely, but not aggressively. In the second quarter, we saw quite strong growth in sales. It's a, I would say, a reflection on places where Oliver Wyman's being selected to support our clients really transformative moments led by our public sector practice, led by our banking practice, transportation and services and our telco teams. And then also some of our other businesses, our economic research consulting nearer and our brand consulting business, Lippincott showing strong growth and our digital practice is showing strong growth. So, I wouldn't say yet that it's correlated with economic uptick. Clients need to use this for that performance transformation as well as for their growth strategy. But sales in the second quarter have been better than we've expected and in the near term, I'm relatively optimistic. And the longer term, the economic outcomes are still fairly widely ranged. Yes, I mean, there are various of our sectors which are perhaps less exposed to the cycles. So, last year you saw we acquired the excellent Avascent business, which is aerospace and defence specialist as an example. So, some of our sectors we've been trying to position ourselves carefully through the cycle. And then on the capabilities side, we do a very large amount of work now in performance transformation. And that's not solely a downturn-oriented solution but it's needed when clients are going through either margin squeeze on the top line or the bottom line. And then a couple of years ago, we started to build a restructuring practice, it's still very nascent, but we've seen very strong growth in that area as well. So that's just a few different examples. I think the final point I'd make is that really from the pandemic onwards, we've seen a reduction in the correlation between our different industries. Some have been in downturn for quite a long time, some are working through their own sort of mini crises, which sometimes requires advisory support. And then some are quite cyclical, but I'd note that our private equity private capital practice, which obviously slowed considerably over the last three or four quarters has started to pick up and we're seeing activity there both pre and post feel. So that's a sort of bit of a picture across the business. Yes, there were different puts and takes in our growth numbers, but perhaps 35% to 40% of our growth was driven by our banking practice. As you know, that is really a preeminent business for us. And at the beginnings of that, crisis. We felt that was just adding to uncertainty may lead to some pauses in decisions which may slow down the pipeline. In the second quarter, we did see some work coming through from it. It's hard to separate out exactly how much is driven by crisis response versus banks preparing to get ahead of capabilities that they now know they need given the very different interest rate environment. There are a lot of the core essentials of the banking system, our muscles that haven't had to be used in the very low-rate environment we've had for a very, very long time. And so, there is work on liability management, interest rate risk management, deposit management, the value of the branch network. Not to mention tuning ourselves up for the new tech and AI capabilities that might be helpful. But yes, we have seen that be a driver of some business already and we continue to expect that over the coming quarters. We don't give a breakout. I mean, it's one of our strongest practices. It's also one of the largest sectors in management consulting globally. But it's, yes, one of our strength areas."

            "name": "Martin South",
            "content": "Thanks, John. As we said, we had a great strong organic growth of 10% in the second quarter, which is on top of 9%, which we posted in the second quarter of '22, and better than full year growth of 8%. As you said, great balance international was 10%, Latin America is 17%, EMEA 11%, APAC 6%, U.S. and Canada 9%. I'd say the growth has been, it's a really nice balance across all the geographies. The specialties growth was strong. Credit specialties, construction, aviation, energy and power strong, our advisory business, part of the risk advisor of the future, very strong double-digit growth. MMB was strong. Renewal growth was strong. So, it's just a nice mix of business across the board, both new business and renewal. Yes. Thank you, John. As I mentioned earlier, that where we've seen really good growth in specialty areas being in the credit specialties, maybe not surprising given what's happening in the environment. Construction has been very strong internationally. Aviation and energy and power as those go through transition there and aviation is bounced back. So, feeling very good about that a little so take it with the advisory business as well where we -- the two businesses hang together. We're advising clients increasingly on how to manage that lost cost had to drive growth during the energy transition and so forth. So, all of those specialty areas we're seeing really strong growth and momentum and that's how we go to market. That's how we differentiate ourselves through that lens. Okay. I think the important thing when we look at international, we like to look at growth over longer periods of time. With regard to APAC 6% underlying growth in the quarter. It's 8% year-to-date. We think that's much more indicative of what the growth would be like over a longer period of time. Likewise, we probably have slightly elevated growth in Latin America, we'd expect that to normalize over a period of time as well. So, I just think it's something that we're not worried about. We have a great business in Asia Pac and feel very confident about the future."

            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning. Our second quarter results were outstanding with continued momentum in underlying growth, mid-teens adjusted EPS growth and solid margin expansion. Our consolidated revenue increased 9% to $5.9 billion with underlying growth of 11%. Operating income was $1.5 billion and adjusted operating income was also $1.5 billion up 17%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points to 27.7% a good result given the headwinds from the talent investments we made in 2022, the timing of our annual raises and the continued rebound in expenses such as T&E that we mentioned last quarter. GAAP EPS was $2.07 and adjusted EPS was $2.20 up 16% over last year. For the first six months of 2023, underlying revenue growth was 10%. Our adjusted operating income grew 15% to $3.3 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points and our adjusted EPS increased 13% to $4.74. Looking at risk and insurance services, second quarter revenue was $3.7 billion up 12% compared with a year ago, or 13% on an underlying basis. This result marks the ninth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in nearly two decades. Operating income increased 20% to $1.2 billon. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $1.2 billion and our adjusted operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 34.2%. For the first six months of the year, revenue in RIS was $7.6 billion with underlying growth of 12%. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $2.6 billion and the margin increased 170 basis points to 36.4%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $3 billion up 9% from a year ago or 10% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 9% growth in the second quarter of last year. Growth in the second quarter reflected strong new business and excellent retention. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 9% for the quarter. In international, underlying growth was 10% and comes on top of 9% in the second quarter of 2022. Latin America was up 17%, EMEA was up 11% and Asia Pacific grew 6%. For the first six months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $5.8 billion with underlying growth of 9%. U.S. and Canada grew 8% and international was up 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $576 million in the quarter, up 10% or 11% on an underlying basis driven by strong growth across all regions and global specialties. For the first six months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.6 billion of revenue and 10% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion up 4% from a year ago or 8% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $388 million. Adjusted operating income increased 9% to $403 million. The adjusted operating margin was 19.2% compared to 19.3% in the second quarter of last year. For the first six months of 2023, Consulting revenue was $4.2 billion representing underlying growth of 6% and adjusted operating income increased 5% to $809 million. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis, representing the ninth consecutive quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth in Mercer. Wealth grew 3% driven by continued strength in defined benefits. Investment management also delivered modest growth. Our assets under management were $393 billion at the end of the second quarter up 11% sequentially and 14% compared to the second quarter of last year. Growth was driven by a modest rebound in capital markets, positive net flows and our transaction with Westpac. Health underlying growth was 10% and reflected strength in all segments and regions. Career revenue increased 6% on top of 17% growth in the second quarter of last year. We continue to see demand for rewards, talent strategy and workforce transformation advice and solutions. With first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.7 billion with 7% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $798 million, an increase of 11% on an underlying business and reflected continued strength in the Middle East and Europe and a rebound in the Americas. With first six months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.5 billion, an increase of 6% on an underlying basis. Foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.01 headwind in the third quarter and a $0.01 benefit in the fourth quarter. We reported $65 million of total restructuring costs in the quarter, approximately $50 million of which relates to the program we announced in the fourth quarter. These charges include costs related to severance, lease exits and streamlining our technology environment. We continue to expect total charges under this program to be $375 million to $400 million. To date, we've incurred approximately $300 million of charges and currently expect to incur most of the remaining costs in 2023. We still expect to achieve total savings of roughly $300 million by 2024, and now expect to realize approximately $200 million in 2023. Our other net benefit credit was $60 million in the quarter. For the full year 2023, we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $240 million. Investment income was $3 million in the second quarter on a GAAP basis and $2 million on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the second quarter was $146 million up from $140 million in the second quarter of 2022. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on short term borrowings, which we use for efficient working capital management. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $142 million of interest expense in the third quarter and approximately $567 million for the full year. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was 24.2% compared with 23.7% in the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. The largest discrete item this quarter was the accounting for share-based compensation. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $12.6 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is October 2023, when $250 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. Last week, we raised our quarterly dividend by 20% marking our 14th consecutive year of dividend growth. This increase, the largest in 25 years reflects our strong earnings growth over the past couple of years, confidence in our outlook. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1.2 billion. Usage of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion and included $295 million for dividends, $421 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases. The first six months, uses of cash totaled $1.9 billion and included $591 million for dividends, $701 million for acquisitions and $600 million for share repurchases. Given our strong results in the first half, we now expect high-single-digit underlying revenue growth for the full year. We continue to expect margin expansion for the full year and strong growth in adjusted EPS. This guidance is based on our outlook today, but as John mentioned, there continues to be uncertainty in the environment looking forward. So outcomes could be different than our current assumptions. Overall, our excellent start leaves us well-positioned for another great year in 2023. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to, John. Yes. Hi, Elyse, how are you? Elyse, you see that we did take up the outlook for this year to $200 million but left the overall at $300 million. It just reflects the fact that we're executing well, and we've just gotten added a little bit quicker. And as we said last quarter, wouldn't be a bad assumption just to assume the savings comes in ratably across the year. And, I would say the same thing. It's just that we've gotten at the savings a little bit quicker. So, I would just assume a ratable spreading over course of the year as opposed to all the increase coming in the back half. Yes, thanks Mike. I -- we've, as I consistently say, we really try not to emphasize focusing too much on free cash flow growth in any quarter or even a year, it can be really volatile. Yes, as you point out in the second quarter, free cash flow was up quite nicely. If there is, we have to be careful especially early in the year for us, because it's a bit of a low base issue, with our cash flows tend to be lower early in the year, as you know then later in the year. But look, we've had a terrific run over a long period time of double digit free cash flow growth that has tracked pretty closely to our run of double-digit earnings growth last decade and as we've talked about, we're confident in our outlook for continued strong earnings growth and what we would expect that our free cash flow growth in the future would track that as well."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, David for the question. And you touched on it. The quarter growth this quarter was on top of challenging 17% comparable for the second quarter of last year. Our quarter at 6% in Q2 now has also been impacted by the delay of start of certain projects. But I would say that the fundamentals for the business remain very strong. We have 9% growth year-to-date. The demand for service continues, our clients still grapple with labor shortages, wage inflation, dealing with new ways of working, tech in the workplace. We discussed generative AI with the clients. So, you're right, it's also a business that has the largest opponent the discretionary compliance for us at Mercer and we are always watching the macroeconomics. But I would say at this point, our sales, our pipeline, client sentiments, very strong. So it continues to give us good visibility into strength for the third quarter and beyond. So, I'm confident that the rest of the year will be good for career. Yes, absolutely. I mean, our OCIO business is grown really rapidly over the last few years. But as you know, it's been impacted by capital markets over the last many quarters. Although it does benefit from net AUM inflows, some of that volatility does drive demand for the OCIO service, What we've seen in Q2 is still a small drag due to year-over-year capital market, but based on the value that we see at the end of the quarter, it bodes well for the rest of the year small accretive growth from capital markets for Q3 as far as we can see from levels today. So, this is a good business for us. It's about diversified portfolio, the volatility in the equipment market has come down. On the bond market, it's still a little bit elevated. But all of that has contributed to lower need on the client side for advice regarding the volatility, the funding of their pension plans, etcetera. It's been good for us and for our clients have been finding new ways to deal with the environment."

[Operator Instructions] I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan.\nJohn Doyle: Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, the President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan had a strong start to 2023. Our first quarter results were excellent and we are well positioned for another good year. Top line momentum continued as we generated 9% underlying revenue growth on top of 10% growth in the first quarter of last year. We had strong growth across most businesses, segments and geographies with underlying growth at Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Mercer accelerating compared to the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 13% versus a year ago, reflecting our strong growth. Our adjusted operating margin expanded by 150 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 and adjusted EPS growth was strong at 10%, building on 16% in the first quarter of 2022. In addition to delivering terrific results, we continued to execute on acquisitions. On April 1, we completed the merger of BT Super with Mercer Super Trust creating one of Australia's most competitive super funds with approximately 850,000 members and 63 billion of assets under management. I'm pleased with our performance, especially when viewed in the context of the volatile macroeconomic environment. The global economy has been contending with high inflation, aggressive tightening of monetary policy by central banks, some recent bank failures and the effects of geopolitical instability. We have a track record of resilience across economic cycles, and there are factors that support continued growth in our business. Although the outlook for real GDP growth continues to be under pressure, inflation remains elevated, driving higher insured values and loss costs. P&C insurance and reinsurance rates continued to increase as carriers priced to account for the rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, social inflation and higher reinsurance costs. Healthcare costs are trending higher and employers expect further increases in the years ahead. Labor markets remain tight in most major economies with 3.5% unemployment and nearly 10 million unfilled jobs in the U.S. and short-term interest rates are at the highest level since the financial crisis, lifting fiduciary income. Change and uncertainty create complexity as well as opportunity for clients. Marsh McLennan's leadership and capabilities and risk strategy and people help them navigate shifting landscapes. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, primary insurance rate increases persisted with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 4% overall in line with the fourth quarter. Property rate increases accelerated to 10% and casualty pricing was up in the low single digit range. Workers' Compensation was flat and financial and professional liability insurance rates were down mid-single digits. Cyber insurance saw the highest increase in our index, although the rate of increase continued to moderate. In reinsurance market conditions remained challenging from January 1 through April 1. Risk appetite for property catastrophe reinsurance remains constrained. Reinsurers continue to push for structural changes and tightened terms and conditions. Limited new capital has entered the market to support property catastrophe risks. At April renewals U.S. property cat reinsurance rates saw increases of 40% to 60% on average for non-loss affected accounts with higher increases for loss affected business. U.S. casualty reinsurance rate increases were more modest. In Japan, property cat rates were up 15% to 25%. The impact of rate increases on ceded premiums was mitigated by higher retentions. We continue to help our clients manage through these challenging market conditions. Now, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on our recent strategic initiatives and highlight some of the steps we've taken. As we discussed last quarter, our leadership team is focused on delivering the full capabilities of Marsh McLennan to our clients, continuously improving the client and colleague experience, efficiently managing capital and driving growth and value for shareholders. There are meaningful opportunities at the intersections of our businesses where our colleagues can deliver the benefits of our scale, data, insights and solutions that are highly valued by clients. In February, we name Flavio Piccolomini to lead Marsh McLennan for International and Pat Tomlinson to lead U.S. and Canada. Since then, we have also named additional Marsh McLennan region and country leaders. These leaders are driving greater client impact through enhanced collaboration, while at the same time maintaining the strength of the value propositions of each of our businesses. This deliberate focus on collaboration is already yielding benefits. Let me share some examples. Guy Carpenter Securities and Mercer Investments successfully arranged an insurance linked securities transaction for a major insurer to transfer earthquake risk. This type of win, the first of its kind in the insurer's market was possible because of the combined strength of Guy Carpenter's leadership in earthquake parametric structuring and Mercer's deep local investment and regulatory expertise.\nOliver: As we drive deeper collaboration, we're also finding new ways to operate, reduce complexity and organize for impact. As we noted in January, we took actions to align our workforce and skillsets with evolving needs, rationalized technology, and reduced our real estate footprint. We see opportunities for savings beyond the actions we have already taken. Mark will provide further details, but overall, we now expect roughly $300 million of savings by 2024 with total cost to achieve these savings of $375 million to $400 million. Our leadership appointments, go-to-market collaboration and restructuring actions are an opportunity to accelerate impact for clients, reinvest in our capabilities, and to be more efficient and connected. Before I turn to our results, I want to comment on ESG. Our recently released ESG report highlights the many ways in which Marsh McLennan is meeting these challenges and helping clients better manage their strategies. We have a track record of ESG engagement, and it's an area where we continue to see an opportunity to support our colleagues, clients, and communities. Sometimes this work takes place at the macro or community level like Guy Carpenter's work helping communities build resilience in the face of natural disasters through community-based catastrophe insurance. But more often it takes place in our work with clients such as helping clients navigate an evolving climate landscape or our efforts to help organizations address gender and racial pay equity and ensure fairness in rewards. We are proud of the work we do in this area and consider it a privilege to help clients progress their ESG strategies. Now, let me turn to our first quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.53, which is up 10% from a year ago, or 12%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. On an underlying basis revenue grew 9%. Underlying revenue grew 11% in RIS and 5% in consulting. Marsh was up 9%, Guy Carpenter grew 10%, Mercer grew 7%, and Oliver Wyman was flat after growing revenue nearly 40% over the last two years. Overall the first quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 13% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 150 basis points year-over-year. Turning to our outlook, we are well positioned for 2023 and continue to expect mid-single digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook contemplates that current macro conditions persist, but as we discussed earlier, there's uncertainty regarding the economic backdrop, which could turn out to be different than our assumptions. In summary, the first quarter was a great start to the year for Marsh McLennan. Our business delivered strong performance and we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives. I'm proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value that they deliver to our clients and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our first quarter results were outstanding and reflected continued momentum in underlying growth, strong margin expansion and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Our consolidated revenue increased 7% in the first quarter to $5.9 billion with underlying growth of 9%. Operating income was $1.7 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 13% to $1.8 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 31.2%. GAAP EPS was $2.47 and adjusted EPS was $2.53, up 10% over last year. Looking at risk and insurance services, first quarter revenue was $3.9 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis. This result marks the eighth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS continues the best stretch of growth in nearly two decades. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $1.4 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 38.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 8% from the first quarter of last year, or 9% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 11% growth in the first quarter of last year, and reflects acceleration from the fourth quarter. Growth in the first quarter reflected excellent retention and strong new business. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 7% for the quarter, a solid result given the continued headwind from lower M&A and capital markets activity. In International underlying growth was strong at 10% and comes on top of 11% growth in the first quarter of 2022. Asia-Pacific was up 11%. EMEA was up 10% and Latin America grew 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $1.1 billion, up 7% or 10% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth across all regions and global specialties and reflecting the tighter reinsurance market conditions. In the Consulting segment first quarter revenue was $2 billion, up 1% from a year ago or 5% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $411 million, and adjusted operating income was $406 million, up 1%, reflecting continued foreign exchange headwinds and the softer quarter at Oliver Wyman. Our adjusted operating margin in Consulting was 20.3% in the first quarter, a decrease of 30 basis points. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 7% on an underlying basis. Career revenue increased 12%, the eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth and reflected continued demand in rewards, talent strategy and workforce transformation. Health underlying growth was 12% and reflected strength in employer and government segments and momentum across all regions. Wealth grew 2% on an underlying basis, driven by continued strength in defined benefits consulting, partly offset by a decline in investment management due to continued capital market headwinds. Our assets under management were $354 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 3% sequentially, but down 9% from the first quarter of last year due to market declines and foreign exchange that more than offset positive net flows. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the first quarter was $687 million, which was flat on an underlying basis. As John noted, this follows a nearly 40% increase in Oliver Wyman's revenue over the past two years. Recent sales activity has been encouraging, however, suggesting we could see a return to modest growth in Oliver Wyman in the second quarter. Foreign exchange was a $0.04 headwind in the first quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter and mostly neutral in the second half. I want to provide an update on the restructuring program we discussed last quarter. Based on our plans today, we expect total charges related to this program of between $375 million and $400 million. To date, we have incurred nearly $250 million of charges and currently expect to incur most of the remaining costs in 2023. We expect to achieve total savings of approximately $300 million by 2024 with $160 million to $180 million realized in 2023 and the balance in 2024. Our other net benefit credit was $58 million in the quarter. For the full year of 2023 we continue to expect our other net benefit credit will be about $235 million. Investment income was $2 million in the quarter -- in the first quarter on a GAAP basis, or $4 million on an adjusted basis. This compares to $17 million of investment income in the first quarter of 2022 on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the first quarter was $136 million, up from $110 million in the first quarter of 2022. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on commercial paper, which we use for efficient working capital management. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $150 million of interest expense in the second quarter and approximately $575 million for the full year. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 25% compared with 23.1% in the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation similar to a year ago. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management, our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $13 billion. This includes the $600 million of senior notes we issued in March. Our next scheduled debt maturity is October, 2023 when $250 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter, totaled $876 million, and included $296 million for dividends, $280 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and there are factors in the macro environment that remain supportive of growth. I would also note that while our current outlook contemplates margin expansion in the second quarter, we expect it will be more modest than in the other quarters, reflecting the talent investments we continued to make last year, the timing of annual raises and a continued rebound in expenses such as T&E relative to last year. Overall, our strong start leaves us well positioned for another good year in 2023. Based on our outlook today, for the full year we continue to expect mid-single digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Thanks, good morning. I had a question just on the increased cost saves from the restructuring, so a pretty big increase in that target. I'm wondering, John, if maybe you could just talk about the sources of those benefits and if this is all we, if there's anything more that we could expect potentially in the future?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Thanks David and good morning. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we're excited about the opportunities at the intersections of our businesses. We're being more deliberate and focused on areas of collaboration, and that's creating both revenue and expense or efficiency opportunities for us. I shared or spoke about the news about Flavio and Pat's appointments, so I'm excited about that and the other regional leaders and country leaders that we put in place to really capture these opportunities for us. So, but from an efficiency point of view, they're in the similar areas to what we talked about on the fourth quarter call earlier this year. It's in the area of talent of course and re-skilling and moving talent to important growth opportunities. And I would point out we are reinvesting as well, although the savings we talked about, that's net of reinvestment, beyond people, it's technology and real estate and so it's our best estimate at the moment. But again, we're going to continue to look for opportunities along the way.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it, thanks and, oh sorry, go ahead.\nJohn Doyle: Oh, go ahead. Sorry, David, follow up.\nDavid Motemaden: Yes, I guess I would just follow up on that and just ask, talent is one that you had mentioned. I'm just wondering the Marsh Operational Excellence program and using Centers of Excellence, I'm just wondering how many employees do you have in these centers and where do you think you can get that to over what time period?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, it's you know, we're not in the early stages of the game in terms of mid and back office efficiency opportunity. And I would point out it's broader than Marsh or have similar more kind of way at Mercer and at Guy Carpenter as well. There's still opportunities in front, but we're also still investing in capabilities including in talent and in technology to support these efforts. And so that will drive further efficiencies for us down the road. Thank you, David. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. So I had a question on organic growth and the acceleration you reported in the first quarter in the RIS division. Just wondering to what extent results benefited from sort of one off type timing of business type things, or were there other factors that you think are more sustainable in nature?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, sure Jimmy, and good morning. You know, I was very pleased with the start to the year, as you noted, and I pointed out in my prepared remarks, it's an acceleration from our growth in the fourth quarter. You know, I talked about some of the macros that are supportive of growth, not just in RIS, but in our business more broadly. But I also want to point out we've invested in talent in growth areas. We've deployed capital in markets that we think have strong growth fundamentals. And we've also been quite focused all throughout the company in investing in our sales operations capabilities, in tools as well. There's nothing really one-off about what happened in the first quarter. And we feel good about, feel good again about the revenue growth. Maybe I'll ask Martin to share some details and then Dean, to give a little bit of more color of where we saw some of the strong growth in RIS in the quarter.\nMartin South: Thank you, John. I'd be delighted to, yes. We're very pleased with the strong organic growth at 9% in Q1, which is on top of the 11% posted in Q1 2022. Our strongest quarter last year, and better than the full year growth of 8%. Solid growth is across International 10%, APAC at 11% EMEA 10%, LAC at 10%, U.S. and Canada at 7%. And as expected, the U.S. and Canada results were once again impacted through tough comps and transactional risk and elevated M&A, SPAC and capital markets activity at the beginning of 2022, when the overall 9% growth in the quarter was on top of 11% in Q1 2022. The specialty growth was good. Credit specialties, construction, aviation, and marine cargo, easily overset the drop in M&A growth. Renewal growth is very strong in U.S and Canada, fueled by the new business we put on in 2022 and stronger client retention and reduced loss business which is very pleasing. So we feel very good how we're positioned. We're very good about our talent, the capabilities in the business and the consistency of the performance across the book and over a number of courses.\nJohn Doyle: All right, great, thanks Martin. Dean, do you want to share some thoughts on the reinsurance market?\nDean Klisura: Thanks, John. Similar to Martin, we're very pleased with Guy Carpenter's 10% underlying growth in the quarter. Again, following 11% growth in the first quarter of 2022, we had very strong growth, consistent growth across all of our regions globally. And despite significant headwinds in the ILS [ph] capital market impacting retrocession placements, our global specialty team had a very, very strong first quarter. Certainly our results reflect tightening market conditions and restrictions in capacity, as John noted, but I think demand for our advice and solutions remains very, very strong in a very challenging environment for our clients. We think the marketplace will be a pricing tailwind moving throughout 2023 and beyond. And keep in mind at Guy Carpenter, we hired significant talent in the marketplace the last three years, and that showed up with record new business levels in 2022 with very strong momentum into the first quarter and beyond.\nJohn Doyle: Great, thanks Dean. Jimmy, do you have a followup?\nJimmy Bhullar: Yes, just a similar question on Oliver Wyman. I think Mark mentioned that you expect modest growth in the second quarter, but should we assume that the results this quarter were impacted by just economic uncertainty and to the extent that continues, then that's the business that will see slower growth through the course of this year?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Jimmy, I'll ask Nick to jump in, but I want to reiterate again, there's a step change in the size of Oliver Wyman's business over the last couple of years. We saw 40% growth and so there is good demand for capabilities at Oliver Wyman. But Nick, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the first quarter and what you're seeing in the pipeline at the moment.\nNick Studer: Thank you very much for the question, Jimmy. We've known it was coming. I think as I was looking back over the transcripts, it's four or five quarters, I've had the question about economic uncertainty and growth. And you can see from the business headlines, it's a tougher environment for consulting firms right now. We have flat underlying growth. We have added some size through excellent acquisitions. Even at that level, I'm confident that we continue to gain share. It's a fragmented market. It's falling back from the peaks of the last couple of years. And we signaled in Q4 a slowing in our sales as our clients and probably a little bit us as well, paused after a torrid two years and we were taking stock, they were taking stock. In our clients' cases there was that economic uncertainty that you've highlighted. And add on top of that, the regular drumbeats of deal driven revenues in our private equity practice and across our industry practices also remains depressed. I'm extremely confident for the future. We continue to be selective to support clients in significant transformations around the world. We have growth in a range of our businesses. Our India, Middle East and Africa business, where we had a good acquisition last year is growing strongly. Our top sectors are the public sector, automotive and manufacturing and energy, so quite broad based. Our [indiscernible] top brands and innovation business, our economic consultancy mirror are in robust health. Our digital practice continues well. And as I've said before, we've been preparing for more countercyclical offerings in our nascent restructuring practice. Although it's small, it's growing strongly. So we generally guide that through the cycle, we expect mid- to high single-digit growth. But last year was obviously much higher than this. We're now in the slower part of the cycle. But as Mark said, we are currently expecting modest growth in Q2.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks Nick. Before we leave the revenue growth story, I want to ask Martine to jump in here as well. We had a terrific quarter at Mercer, a particularly strong growth in both Career and our Benefits business, but also a rebound in investments. Martine, maybe you could share some thoughts.\nMartine Ferland: Yes. No, thank you, John and indeed, we're very pleased with our results, 7% overall and following a 6% Q1 last year, it's across all the regions. And I would say, there's the current macroeconomic environment is really supportive of the services that we bring to market. Our inflation and interest rate, volatile capital market, well-funded defined benefit plans, tight labor markets, demand for digital health services, new ways of working. And we've made quite a lot of investments as well in clear strategy, client segmentation, much more focused their investment in talent, in digital tools and intellectual capital. And therefore, I would say that these market conditions, combined with the clarity of our strategy, our investment, are conducive to this kind of growth. The pipeline that we see, the sales that we are entering Q2 with is strong, and we have good visibility in the next quarter and probably a little bit over. Of course, we're always monitoring the macroeconomic conditions, as we've discussed with Oliver Wyman. But over the years, we've also invested in diversifying our portfolio towards faster growth elements and more recurring businesses in the portfolio. So it looks solid for continuity in the year.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Martine. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, good morning. I hope the questions, I don't have less yield, but I wonder, I'm curious about any comments on the U.S. Federal Trade Commission proposal to get rid of noncompetes. One of your peers commented publicly that they were against that. Any color? Did you guys make a comment and do most? Is it correct that most producers in the U.S. do have noncompetes in their contracts?\nJohn Doyle: Yes, thanks Mike. I don't think there's a lot to report on here. We, of course, are always monitoring any potential regulatory changes or possible impacts on our business. We're certainly very well aware of the FTC proposal, and we've offered feedback through a number of different industry channels. We think Marsh McLennan is an employer of choice in a very competitive industry. We see a healthy environment for sure. And there really aren't noncompetes in businesses for our producers. And if you read the trade press, you'd see a pretty active market for talent. It's a market that we're a net winner in, but nonetheless, there's an active market and talent moving around throughout the industry.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay, understood. My followup is on the good, better-than-expected consulting results ex-Oliver Wyman. Just digging in maybe more, it sounds like from your comments, you're not really calling out any kind of one-offs. Just kind of curious if you'd be willing to share whether the results were better than you internally had expected given the kind of macro outlook, especially in like Career, or are things really just we're maybe focusing too much on some of the headlines you read, and things underneath the surface aren't as bad as some of the headlines might suggest.\nJohn Doyle: Look, I think the eco -- yes, yes, no thanks, Mike. Look, the economy has proven to be quite resilient, right? There's no question about that. And I think when you think about Mercer's Career business, there are services that we provide that were probably more discretionary in the past than they are in the current environment. Martine also noted how we've really tried to move into and deployed capital into more growth markets. We have high expectations for our businesses. And so again, we're pleased with the start to the year was good terrific growth. Martine talked about the environment, it remains quite strong, so no major surprises. But again, we're pleased with the start to the year. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks and good morning. My first question is on the savings program. Can you give us a sense of how much of those 160 to 180 hit your results in the first quarter? And I'm also interested in getting a breakdown between RIS and Consulting? And also, can you give us a sense of the pacing for whatever cedes are left and how that should hit results for the balance of the year?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Thanks, Elyse, for the question. Mark, do you want to talk a bit more about that?\nMark McGivney: Yes. We haven't been terribly specific, but I'll try to be helpful. So in terms of the -- how much hit in the first quarter, I think we took a lot of action in the fourth quarter of last year, as you saw through the size of the charges. So I think it's probably a reasonable assumption to -- if you wanted to assume a ratable pacing of the 180 to -- or 160 to 180 throughout this year. That's probably not bad. And as John noted earlier, that's net of reinvestments, so that will fall to the bottom line. In terms of split across businesses, we haven't been specific there, but you could look at the proportion of charges in some of our disclosures and make a rough approximation there as well. And so I think ratable spreading of the 160 to 180 through this year is not a bad way to go.\nJohn Doyle: Do you have a followup, Elyse?\nElyse Greenspan: Yes. On the reinsurance side, you guys have highlighted that's an area where you've hired a lot of talent over the last few years. I think I've also seen recently, you might have lost some talent, which we often see in the industry. So just as you think about like the tailwinds of strong pricing in that business, which came up earlier, do you think we can continue to see double-digit organic growth within that business as we kind of see the full impact of the midyear renewals and beyond?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Elyse. Look, again, it was a terrific start to the year. I'm very proud of our team. It's a very difficult marketplace and helping our insurance company clients navigate in a very, very challenging market. And it obviously has a follow-on effect on our clients at Marsh as well and so we're investing in our capabilities there and are well positioned for growth. It is -- it's an active talent market. As I said earlier, it's a -- from a talent point of view, I really like how we're positioned. Our focus from a talent value proposition is about being your best at Marsh McLennan in all of our businesses and again we've been a net winner there. From time to time, obviously, we'll -- we do have some voluntary turnover, but the turnover you may have read about, it won't impact the trajectory of Guy Carpenter or our business. So we'll see where the market heads. Both Dean and I commented, property cat is the big headline at the moment, that's a line of business that's most acute here in the United States we have a much bigger, broader business than that. But demand for our services there remains quite strong. So we look forward to a good year at Guy Carpenter. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to drill into the retirement business and just any comments on how the economic backdrop may be impacting the business in providing any benefits?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Robert. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll ask Martine to unpack some of the investment in Mercer Wealth results overall. Martine?\nMartine Ferland: Yes. No, my pleasure to do so. Thanks for the question, Robert. It was a good quarter for defined benefit business. And basically, the market condition, the volatility, there's a lot that we can do to help clients navigate through these changes. And I'm pretty proud of the team that has been quite innovative and proactive in addressing these challenges. With the rise of interest rate, even though the asset side of the pension plans are depressed through equity, we've seen a great improvement in the funding of these plans. And when the funding of these plans become better a lot of our clients looked for ways to divest the liabilities and assets to insurers. So we're seeing activities there in the buyout space, and that has fueled the DB Consulting business. So that being said, of course, the DB segment itself on the market is in structural decline. So underneath this, you'll continue to see this. But in the meantime, with the volatility, it does require quite a lot of work, and we're happy to help clients through these times. The other side of that equation in retirement is also the investment side. On the Consulting side, again, we were very busy helping through the volatility, the decline in equity, et cetera. And our OCIO business, which is directly related, we're taking basis points up of the value of assets as a way to pay for the services we render and of course, when the value of assets are depressed, our revenue goes down. But we have net flows into that business. It's a business that has very good long-term growth through net flows through return. It's just been a more difficult period over the last year and a half. We're seeing still quarter-over-quarter like year-over-year headwinds, because the decline in market really started later in Q2 and then through Q3 last year. So that pressure on the year-over-year basis should ease out at current if the current AUM value stay at current level, we should see that starting to turn around in Q3.\nJohn Doyle: Terrific, thank you. Robert, do you have a followup?\nRobert Cox: Yes, thanks and just one followup. Are you seeing any benefit from China reopening in RIS? And just wondering if that's something you expect could potentially be a tailwind as we progress through the year?\nJohn Doyle: It's hard to say overall, Robert. I mean, what I would tell you is that our business in China has performed well, even through, if you want to call it, the shutdown of the economy. So we've had good solid growth in our business, both in the Mainland and in Hong Kong. I think, obviously, I think, broadly speaking, the reopening of that economy should ease some of the economic uncertainty all around the world. And to the extent that, that could be helpful from a macro point of view, we certainly are -- we're certainly pleased with those developments. But it's hard to draw a direct correlation. We haven't seen a meaningful uptick, for example, in our -- in growth in China since the reopening. Operator next question please?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks, good morning. I know we've talked about this in the past John, but I was hoping you could walk us through the impact of higher fiduciary income on margins. I'm asking specifically about second quarter, where you were talking about more cautious margin expansion expectations despite the fact that, at least in the first quarter, your fiduciary income was up like 2,000%?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Look, obviously, fiduciary income is a -- it's a factor in our overall results. We don't look at it separately. We're constantly trying to balance near-term performance, delivering excellent results in the near term with also investing in the capabilities that are going to lead to sustainable growth in the future. We're very thoughtful about how we manage our expense base. That leads to very few surprises for us around our results. And I think we've read that needle well, if you will, nailed that balance over the course of the last couple of years. So we're very pleased with the start to the year from a margin point of view. As we've talked about in the past, margins are -- particularly in a quarter, are not our primary objective. It's an outcome of the way we've run the business. We've had 15 consecutive years of margin expansion. We expect 2023 to be year number 16. But from quarter-to-quarter, some seasonality to investments we make and some other variability that could lead to a different outcome from a -- so it won't be a straight line quarter-to-quarter.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. The second question, if I can. In your prepared remarks, you talked about health care costs going up and I was hoping you could talk us through from, I guess, our perspective, how that impacts, I'm thinking predominantly Mercer because I wouldn't think it would have the same upside that P&C rate increases have.\nJohn Doyle: Well, where we are in commission, obviously it could be helpful and we get paid in different ways and in different EH&B markets around the world. And so again, it's not a straight line. And much like we've talked about in the context of reinsurance, we're very transparent about the compensation we earn and how we get paid with our clients. But effectively, a rising cost of risk is a tailwind, whether it's in P&C or in benefits to us. But we also provide other services and consulting services to our clients to help them navigate some of the challenges. And the tight labor market is a factor here as well. So Martine, maybe you can offer a little more color?\nMartine Ferland: You're absolutely right. There's also another element within Health that distinguish it from P&C in a way, is that very often our clients are looking to not increase net cost for their employees because they very often share in the cost. So we see a lot of demand for services from our part on a consulting basis to change the design of these plans to come up with digital solutions instead so that we can control the cost. So the inflation is not always directly manifesting itself in the premiums or in the coverage. There's also, as you said John, a good part of our book that is on fees rather than on commission. So overall, there are many different components pushing the pressure because you're absolutely right, the healthcare costs are increasing all over the world, but the reaction from employers is to try to mitigate these costs through innovative solutions.\nJohn Doyle: One other point on our Health and Benefits business, just to share with everyone, is that it's kind of an important proof point around some of the possibilities around collaboration inside of the company. This is a business that Mercer and Marsh work on together all over the world and it's been a really important growth driver for us over the course of the last couple of years, and it's been a bit of a source of inspiration around what's possible as we come together more and bring our collective capabilities to the client. So thank you, Meyer. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, both margin-related. So the first one, maybe piggybacking on Meyer's last -- first question. So clearly, you've had three consecutive quarters of 200 basis points or more of adjusted margin improvement in RIS, that's very notable. At the same time, if I'm doing the math correctly, fiduciary income added, what 230 basis points of margins this quarter? Cost saves, I think, by Mark's comments, add another 100 basis points. So there seemed to have been some offsets in RIS. Could you talk about those?\nJohn Doyle: I don't -- certainly don't think of it in terms of offsets. Again, I'm pleased with the margin expansion in the quarter. As I said, we're very disciplined about how we manage our cost base. And we're not trying to optimize margins in any given quarter, right? We're trying to strike that balance between delivering terrific results today and sustainable growth and investment in capabilities that our clients are looking for in the future. So I'm very pleased with our start to the year from a margin perspective.\nYaron Kinar: And I apologize if I'm belaboring the point, but I'm still a little confused, because I thought the $160 million to $180 million of cost saves that were going to be ratable over the year were net of reinvestments. And it sounds like there was some reinvestment in growth this quarter.\nJohn Doyle: We're always investing, of course, in future capabilities that will lead to sustainable growth in the future. There are some direct hiring that we did and investment that we did connected with some growth opportunities in our efforts to be more deliberate around collaboration, but we continue to invest broadly across the business as well. There's also T&E pressure. There's other inflationary impacts on the expense base of the company, but again, I'm pleased with 150 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Okay. And my second question is on the consulting side. So I think if it weren't for the JLT legacy legal charges, adjusted operating margin would have expanded quite nicely this quarter. I guess, where are we with these charges? And we were at, what, four years from now the acquisition, do you expect those to continue?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. We're pretty far along in that story. That could be usually only some smaller charges that will happen going forward. They are excluded in the adjusted margin that we report, just so you're aware of that. Most of what happened in the first quarter was the resolution of some legacy litigation that existed at JLT. I think there could be some real estate that we're still sorting our way through, but we're largely past these charges. Operator, next question?\nOperator:\nKligerman:\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey, good morning. I have two quick questions. I think, Martin on Marsh mentioned a bit of a headwind still from the robust IPO and M&A markets in the first quarter of last year. Maybe could you help us size that headwind in the first quarter? And then next quarter, maybe some color on sort of the tailwind of not having it there, I mean I had heard from some competitors that you had a 5% dampening effect on organic revenue growth last year. So just curious if you could help us size that at Marsh?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. We're not going to size that, Andrew. We talked about it a bit in the fourth quarter. It was a bit more of a headwind in the fourth quarter than it was in the first quarter, but it remained a headwind for us. Again, we're pleased with the growth overall. Capital markets are just one input to the overall macro environment and then, of course, what we're doing to execute and to expand our growth. But I mean, you can look at the big data and get a sense of when obviously M&A activity started to tail off and IPO activity. And while it won't be as much of a headwind, it gave us projecting a major rebound in the market over the course of the next quarter or two as well.\nAndrew Kligerman: Got it, okay. So no more headwinds at least. And then you had another good year of net hiring. I think it was around 3,000 last year following 6,000 in 2021. Curious what your outlook is for 2023. Are you expecting to see material net hiring? Maybe any color on what you'd like to do and the geographies of the company where you do it?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Thanks, Andrew. A lot of the hiring we did last year, some of it was connected to the mid- and back-office, some of the work, the investments that we're making to drive some efficiency. Some of it, we brought some contractors on as full-time employees. It was the right economic trade and the rate trade from a service perspective as well. But we're always active in the market in trying to bring talent that will make us better and stronger. And I mentioned earlier, we feel very, very good about our brand in the market. As an employer we work very, very hard at it and voluntary turnovers in all of our businesses at or below historical levels and so we feel terrific. Our colleagues are highly engaged. And it's a complex operating environment, and they're delivering exceptional value to our clients. We'll hire less this year than we did last year or the year before. But again, it's not only the number, the raw number. It's who's on the team and making sure that we're aligning our talent with our clients' needs. Operator, next question?\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith: Yes, thanks. A couple of questions here. First, I want to dig into Oliver Wyman just a little bit more here. Mark, I think you said that sales activity looks like it picked up a little bit in the second quarter. So we'll see a little better. I'm assuming that's because you've got such a good financial services practice at Oliver Wyman. You're seeing some spillover from what's going on with the banking crisis. That's one. And also, if I think about ex that, are you seeing any slowdown in kind of corporate spending you're thinking -- or corporation is thinking about kind of a slowdown here and is that maybe why you're a little more cautious about what potentially could happen here going forward?\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Brian. Look, we have a little less visibility into the pipeline at Oliver Wyman. That's historically been the case with that business. But as Mark pointed, recent sales activity has been better. We appreciate the advertisement on our FI practice. We have a great team of people there. But Nick, maybe you could add a little more color.\nNick Studer: Yes. Thank you, Brian. It's a very good question. I think what we've really seen is uncertainty more than economic decline. A lot of what we do is a matter of choice. But John made a comment with respect to Mercer earlier, that some of those choices become harder not to take right now. There's lots of questions changing, lots of important problems to solve. I think a number of our clients, particularly in the U.S., have been pausing because of the uncertainty. We don't necessarily see that as a big downward step. But they're not quite sure if they're investing for growth or they're investing for cost. And to some extent, the financial services or the banking turmoil extends that period of uncertainty. But we're extremely proud of our market-leading financial services practice in Oliver Wyman. We are, of course, very engaged in that global banking situation, whether that's supporting banks on the management of their funding, deposit and interest rate risks; working with involved factors in the sale and purchase of assets; preparing some of the restructuring that will no doubt be coming. And when we think in the medium to longer-term, that will continue to fuel the growth of that excellent practice.\nJohn Doyle: Brian, do you have a followup?\nBrian Meredith: Yes, absolutely. I just wanted to quickly chat a little bit about commercial property insurance pricing, what's going on in that market. You mentioned good strong price increases in the first quarter. Are we seeing kind of an acceleration in that in the second quarter as some of these carriers kind of adjust to higher reinsurance costs? And could that potentially be a little bit of a tailwind for you all as we look into the remainder of the year?\nJohn Doyle: Yes. Thanks, Brian. I don't think our clients at Marsh think it's a good strong increase in pricing. But yes, we did observe higher rate change in property as we expected in the first quarter, given what happened late in the year and what we saw in the reinsurance market at January 1. So what I would say is, broadly speaking, it's a challenging market for our insurance clients at Marsh. Inflation broadly is driving a higher cost of risk, the frequency of weather-related losses, as you point out. And we did see the U.S. retail market -- property market begin to react to some of the reinsurance market changes as well. But Mark, maybe you could talk about pricing in the market broadly and in property?\nMark McGivney: Yes, of course. Well, John, as you said, it's not a good day for our clients. And our focus is on obviously getting the best deals for our clients and making sure that they stay with us and they understand we're driving innovation where we can. It's the 22nd quarter of consecutive rate increases. You highlighted property, and that did, look, as that picked up momentum again into Q1 it accelerated from 7% rate increases we reported in Q4 2022 to 10% this year. And in addition to that, from a premium perspective, there's clear inflation and exposure growth as well, so real pain for the clients. It doesn't necessarily flow through to our business as a good chunk of that high-risk business with high cat business is fee-based and so it provides us stability there. Other lines of business is being driven by social inflation. Casualty would have been higher, but the workers' compensation, which is pretty flat and it's pretty well around the world. The one area where there has been deceleration in price increases has been in the financial product areas, not just the SPAC and de-SPAC, but also some declines in D&O pricing, driven by the fact, there are 20 new carriers that have come into the marketplace over the last year. But actually, the professional intensity lines are robust, and that's really a function of a prior year action deterioration in the professional lines as social inflation drives that. So it's a bit of a mixed picture. But that's the highlight in terms of growth has been properly, and the rest is seeming to stabilize a little bit.\nJohn Doyle: And Brian, maybe just one last point on the retail property market. A lot of the retail wind and quake risk is from February 1st or even March 1st through the 1st of June. And so really beginning to see what's happening from a risk appetite and from a marketplace perspective. So we're in the middle of the story right now. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan, for any closing remarks.\nJohn Doyle: All right, thank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. And thank you all very much. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, John. Similar to Martin, we're very pleased with Guy Carpenter's 10% underlying growth in the quarter. Again, following 11% growth in the first quarter of 2022, we had very strong growth, consistent growth across all of our regions globally. And despite significant headwinds in the ILS [ph] capital market impacting retrocession placements, our global specialty team had a very, very strong first quarter. Certainly our results reflect tightening market conditions and restrictions in capacity, as John noted, but I think demand for our advice and solutions remains very, very strong in a very challenging environment for our clients. We think the marketplace will be a pricing tailwind moving throughout 2023 and beyond. And keep in mind at Guy Carpenter, we hired significant talent in the marketplace the last three years, and that showed up with record new business levels in 2022 with very strong momentum into the first quarter and beyond."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Doyle",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, the President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. Joining me on the call is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Martine Ferland of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah Dewitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan had a strong start to 2023. Our first quarter results were excellent and we are well positioned for another good year. Top line momentum continued as we generated 9% underlying revenue growth on top of 10% growth in the first quarter of last year. We had strong growth across most businesses, segments and geographies with underlying growth at Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Mercer accelerating compared to the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating income grew 13% versus a year ago, reflecting our strong growth. Our adjusted operating margin expanded by 150 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 and adjusted EPS growth was strong at 10%, building on 16% in the first quarter of 2022. In addition to delivering terrific results, we continued to execute on acquisitions. On April 1, we completed the merger of BT Super with Mercer Super Trust creating one of Australia's most competitive super funds with approximately 850,000 members and 63 billion of assets under management. I'm pleased with our performance, especially when viewed in the context of the volatile macroeconomic environment. The global economy has been contending with high inflation, aggressive tightening of monetary policy by central banks, some recent bank failures and the effects of geopolitical instability. We have a track record of resilience across economic cycles, and there are factors that support continued growth in our business. Although the outlook for real GDP growth continues to be under pressure, inflation remains elevated, driving higher insured values and loss costs. P&C insurance and reinsurance rates continued to increase as carriers priced to account for the rising frequency and severity of catastrophe losses, social inflation and higher reinsurance costs. Healthcare costs are trending higher and employers expect further increases in the years ahead. Labor markets remain tight in most major economies with 3.5% unemployment and nearly 10 million unfilled jobs in the U.S. and short-term interest rates are at the highest level since the financial crisis, lifting fiduciary income. Change and uncertainty create complexity as well as opportunity for clients. Marsh McLennan's leadership and capabilities and risk strategy and people help them navigate shifting landscapes. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, primary insurance rate increases persisted with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 4% overall in line with the fourth quarter. Property rate increases accelerated to 10% and casualty pricing was up in the low single digit range. Workers' Compensation was flat and financial and professional liability insurance rates were down mid-single digits. Cyber insurance saw the highest increase in our index, although the rate of increase continued to moderate. In reinsurance market conditions remained challenging from January 1 through April 1. Risk appetite for property catastrophe reinsurance remains constrained. Reinsurers continue to push for structural changes and tightened terms and conditions. Limited new capital has entered the market to support property catastrophe risks. At April renewals U.S. property cat reinsurance rates saw increases of 40% to 60% on average for non-loss affected accounts with higher increases for loss affected business. U.S. casualty reinsurance rate increases were more modest. In Japan, property cat rates were up 15% to 25%. The impact of rate increases on ceded premiums was mitigated by higher retentions. We continue to help our clients manage through these challenging market conditions. Now, I'd like to take a moment to provide an update on our recent strategic initiatives and highlight some of the steps we've taken. As we discussed last quarter, our leadership team is focused on delivering the full capabilities of Marsh McLennan to our clients, continuously improving the client and colleague experience, efficiently managing capital and driving growth and value for shareholders. There are meaningful opportunities at the intersections of our businesses where our colleagues can deliver the benefits of our scale, data, insights and solutions that are highly valued by clients. In February, we name Flavio Piccolomini to lead Marsh McLennan for International and Pat Tomlinson to lead U.S. and Canada. Since then, we have also named additional Marsh McLennan region and country leaders. These leaders are driving greater client impact through enhanced collaboration, while at the same time maintaining the strength of the value propositions of each of our businesses. This deliberate focus on collaboration is already yielding benefits. Let me share some examples. Guy Carpenter Securities and Mercer Investments successfully arranged an insurance linked securities transaction for a major insurer to transfer earthquake risk. This type of win, the first of its kind in the insurer's market was possible because of the combined strength of Guy Carpenter's leadership in earthquake parametric structuring and Mercer's deep local investment and regulatory expertise. Thank you, Mark. Operator, we're ready to begin Q&A. Sure. Thanks David and good morning. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we're excited about the opportunities at the intersections of our businesses. We're being more deliberate and focused on areas of collaboration, and that's creating both revenue and expense or efficiency opportunities for us. I shared or spoke about the news about Flavio and Pat's appointments, so I'm excited about that and the other regional leaders and country leaders that we put in place to really capture these opportunities for us. So, but from an efficiency point of view, they're in the similar areas to what we talked about on the fourth quarter call earlier this year. It's in the area of talent of course and re-skilling and moving talent to important growth opportunities. And I would point out we are reinvesting as well, although the savings we talked about, that's net of reinvestment, beyond people, it's technology and real estate and so it's our best estimate at the moment. But again, we're going to continue to look for opportunities along the way. Oh, go ahead. Sorry, David, follow up. Yes, it's you know, we're not in the early stages of the game in terms of mid and back office efficiency opportunity. And I would point out it's broader than Marsh or have similar more kind of way at Mercer and at Guy Carpenter as well. There's still opportunities in front, but we're also still investing in capabilities including in talent and in technology to support these efforts. And so that will drive further efficiencies for us down the road. Thank you, David. Operator, next question? Yes, sure Jimmy, and good morning. You know, I was very pleased with the start to the year, as you noted, and I pointed out in my prepared remarks, it's an acceleration from our growth in the fourth quarter. You know, I talked about some of the macros that are supportive of growth, not just in RIS, but in our business more broadly. But I also want to point out we've invested in talent in growth areas. We've deployed capital in markets that we think have strong growth fundamentals. And we've also been quite focused all throughout the company in investing in our sales operations capabilities, in tools as well. There's nothing really one-off about what happened in the first quarter. And we feel good about, feel good again about the revenue growth. Maybe I'll ask Martin to share some details and then Dean, to give a little bit of more color of where we saw some of the strong growth in RIS in the quarter. All right, great, thanks Martin. Dean, do you want to share some thoughts on the reinsurance market? Great, thanks Dean. Jimmy, do you have a followup? Sure. Jimmy, I'll ask Nick to jump in, but I want to reiterate again, there's a step change in the size of Oliver Wyman's business over the last couple of years. We saw 40% growth and so there is good demand for capabilities at Oliver Wyman. But Nick, maybe you can talk a little bit more about the first quarter and what you're seeing in the pipeline at the moment. Thanks Nick. Before we leave the revenue growth story, I want to ask Martine to jump in here as well. We had a terrific quarter at Mercer, a particularly strong growth in both Career and our Benefits business, but also a rebound in investments. Martine, maybe you could share some thoughts. Thank you, Martine. Operator, next question? Yes, thanks Mike. I don't think there's a lot to report on here. We, of course, are always monitoring any potential regulatory changes or possible impacts on our business. We're certainly very well aware of the FTC proposal, and we've offered feedback through a number of different industry channels. We think Marsh McLennan is an employer of choice in a very competitive industry. We see a healthy environment for sure. And there really aren't noncompetes in businesses for our producers. And if you read the trade press, you'd see a pretty active market for talent. It's a market that we're a net winner in, but nonetheless, there's an active market and talent moving around throughout the industry. Look, I think the eco -- yes, yes, no thanks, Mike. Look, the economy has proven to be quite resilient, right? There's no question about that. And I think when you think about Mercer's Career business, there are services that we provide that were probably more discretionary in the past than they are in the current environment. Martine also noted how we've really tried to move into and deployed capital into more growth markets. We have high expectations for our businesses. And so again, we're pleased with the start to the year was good terrific growth. Martine talked about the environment, it remains quite strong, so no major surprises. But again, we're pleased with the start to the year. Operator, next question? Sure. Thanks, Elyse, for the question. Mark, do you want to talk a bit more about that? Do you have a followup, Elyse? Sure, Elyse. Look, again, it was a terrific start to the year. I'm very proud of our team. It's a very difficult marketplace and helping our insurance company clients navigate in a very, very challenging market. And it obviously has a follow-on effect on our clients at Marsh as well and so we're investing in our capabilities there and are well positioned for growth. It is -- it's an active talent market. As I said earlier, it's a -- from a talent point of view, I really like how we're positioned. Our focus from a talent value proposition is about being your best at Marsh McLennan in all of our businesses and again we've been a net winner there. From time to time, obviously, we'll -- we do have some voluntary turnover, but the turnover you may have read about, it won't impact the trajectory of Guy Carpenter or our business. So we'll see where the market heads. Both Dean and I commented, property cat is the big headline at the moment, that's a line of business that's most acute here in the United States we have a much bigger, broader business than that. But demand for our services there remains quite strong. So we look forward to a good year at Guy Carpenter. Operator, next question? Sure, Robert. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll ask Martine to unpack some of the investment in Mercer Wealth results overall. Martine? Terrific, thank you. Robert, do you have a followup? It's hard to say overall, Robert. I mean, what I would tell you is that our business in China has performed well, even through, if you want to call it, the shutdown of the economy. So we've had good solid growth in our business, both in the Mainland and in Hong Kong. I think, obviously, I think, broadly speaking, the reopening of that economy should ease some of the economic uncertainty all around the world. And to the extent that, that could be helpful from a macro point of view, we certainly are -- we're certainly pleased with those developments. But it's hard to draw a direct correlation. We haven't seen a meaningful uptick, for example, in our -- in growth in China since the reopening. Operator next question please? Yes. Look, obviously, fiduciary income is a -- it's a factor in our overall results. We don't look at it separately. We're constantly trying to balance near-term performance, delivering excellent results in the near term with also investing in the capabilities that are going to lead to sustainable growth in the future. We're very thoughtful about how we manage our expense base. That leads to very few surprises for us around our results. And I think we've read that needle well, if you will, nailed that balance over the course of the last couple of years. So we're very pleased with the start to the year from a margin point of view. As we've talked about in the past, margins are -- particularly in a quarter, are not our primary objective. It's an outcome of the way we've run the business. We've had 15 consecutive years of margin expansion. We expect 2023 to be year number 16. But from quarter-to-quarter, some seasonality to investments we make and some other variability that could lead to a different outcome from a -- so it won't be a straight line quarter-to-quarter. Well, where we are in commission, obviously it could be helpful and we get paid in different ways and in different EH&B markets around the world. And so again, it's not a straight line. And much like we've talked about in the context of reinsurance, we're very transparent about the compensation we earn and how we get paid with our clients. But effectively, a rising cost of risk is a tailwind, whether it's in P&C or in benefits to us. But we also provide other services and consulting services to our clients to help them navigate some of the challenges. And the tight labor market is a factor here as well. So Martine, maybe you can offer a little more color? One other point on our Health and Benefits business, just to share with everyone, is that it's kind of an important proof point around some of the possibilities around collaboration inside of the company. This is a business that Mercer and Marsh work on together all over the world and it's been a really important growth driver for us over the course of the last couple of years, and it's been a bit of a source of inspiration around what's possible as we come together more and bring our collective capabilities to the client. So thank you, Meyer. Operator, next question? I don't -- certainly don't think of it in terms of offsets. Again, I'm pleased with the margin expansion in the quarter. As I said, we're very disciplined about how we manage our cost base. And we're not trying to optimize margins in any given quarter, right? We're trying to strike that balance between delivering terrific results today and sustainable growth and investment in capabilities that our clients are looking for in the future. So I'm very pleased with our start to the year from a margin perspective. We're always investing, of course, in future capabilities that will lead to sustainable growth in the future. There are some direct hiring that we did and investment that we did connected with some growth opportunities in our efforts to be more deliberate around collaboration, but we continue to invest broadly across the business as well. There's also T&E pressure. There's other inflationary impacts on the expense base of the company, but again, I'm pleased with 150 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Yes. We're pretty far along in that story. That could be usually only some smaller charges that will happen going forward. They are excluded in the adjusted margin that we report, just so you're aware of that. Most of what happened in the first quarter was the resolution of some legacy litigation that existed at JLT.

And we did see the U.S. retail market -- property market begin to react to some of the reinsurance market changes as well. But Mark, maybe you could talk about pricing in the market broadly and in property? And Brian, maybe just one last point on the retail property market. A lot of the retail wind and quake risk is from February 1st or even March 1st through the 1st of June. And so really beginning to see what's happening from a risk appetite and from a marketplace perspective. So we're in the middle of the story right now. Thank you. All right, thank you, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our over 85,000 colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. And thank you all very much. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, John. I'd be delighted to, yes. We're very pleased with the strong organic growth at 9% in Q1, which is on top of the 11% posted in Q1 2022. Our strongest quarter last year, and better than the full year growth of 8%. Solid growth is across International 10%, APAC at 11% EMEA 10%, LAC at 10%, U.S. and Canada at 7%. And as expected, the U.S. and Canada results were once again impacted through tough comps and transactional risk and elevated M&A, SPAC and capital markets activity at the beginning of 2022, when the overall 9% growth in the quarter was on top of 11% in Q1 2022. The specialty growth was good. Credit specialties, construction, aviation, and marine cargo, easily overset the drop in M&A growth. Renewal growth is very strong in U.S and Canada, fueled by the new business we put on in 2022 and stronger client retention and reduced loss business which is very pleasing. So we feel very good how we're positioned. We're very good about our talent, the capabilities in the business and the consistency of the performance across the book and over a number of courses."

            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning. Our first quarter results were outstanding and reflected continued momentum in underlying growth, strong margin expansion and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Our consolidated revenue increased 7% in the first quarter to $5.9 billion with underlying growth of 9%. Operating income was $1.7 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 13% to $1.8 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points to 31.2%. GAAP EPS was $2.47 and adjusted EPS was $2.53, up 10% over last year. Looking at risk and insurance services, first quarter revenue was $3.9 billion, up 10% compared with a year ago or 11% on an underlying basis. This result marks the eighth consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS continues the best stretch of growth in nearly two decades. Adjusted operating income increased 17% to $1.4 billion, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 38.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, up 8% from the first quarter of last year, or 9% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 11% growth in the first quarter of last year, and reflects acceleration from the fourth quarter. Growth in the first quarter reflected excellent retention and strong new business. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 7% for the quarter, a solid result given the continued headwind from lower M&A and capital markets activity. In International underlying growth was strong at 10% and comes on top of 11% growth in the first quarter of 2022. Asia-Pacific was up 11%. EMEA was up 10% and Latin America grew 10%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $1.1 billion, up 7% or 10% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth across all regions and global specialties and reflecting the tighter reinsurance market conditions. In the Consulting segment first quarter revenue was $2 billion, up 1% from a year ago or 5% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $411 million, and adjusted operating income was $406 million, up 1%, reflecting continued foreign exchange headwinds and the softer quarter at Oliver Wyman. Our adjusted operating margin in Consulting was 20.3% in the first quarter, a decrease of 30 basis points. Mercer's revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 7% on an underlying basis. Career revenue increased 12%, the eighth straight quarter of double-digit growth and reflected continued demand in rewards, talent strategy and workforce transformation. Health underlying growth was 12% and reflected strength in employer and government segments and momentum across all regions. Wealth grew 2% on an underlying basis, driven by continued strength in defined benefits consulting, partly offset by a decline in investment management due to continued capital market headwinds. Our assets under management were $354 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 3% sequentially, but down 9% from the first quarter of last year due to market declines and foreign exchange that more than offset positive net flows. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the first quarter was $687 million, which was flat on an underlying basis. As John noted, this follows a nearly 40% increase in Oliver Wyman's revenue over the past two years. Recent sales activity has been encouraging, however, suggesting we could see a return to modest growth in Oliver Wyman in the second quarter. Foreign exchange was a $0.04 headwind in the first quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter and mostly neutral in the second half. I want to provide an update on the restructuring program we discussed last quarter. Based on our plans today, we expect total charges related to this program of between $375 million and $400 million. To date, we have incurred nearly $250 million of charges and currently expect to incur most of the remaining costs in 2023. We expect to achieve total savings of approximately $300 million by 2024 with $160 million to $180 million realized in 2023 and the balance in 2024. Our other net benefit credit was $58 million in the quarter. For the full year of 2023 we continue to expect our other net benefit credit will be about $235 million. Investment income was $2 million in the quarter -- in the first quarter on a GAAP basis, or $4 million on an adjusted basis. This compares to $17 million of investment income in the first quarter of 2022 on an adjusted basis. Interest expense in the first quarter was $136 million, up from $110 million in the first quarter of 2022. This reflects an increase in long-term debt and higher interest rates on commercial paper, which we use for efficient working capital management. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $150 million of interest expense in the second quarter and approximately $575 million for the full year. Our effective adjusted tax rate in the first quarter was 25% compared with 23.1% in the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation similar to a year ago. Excluding discrete items, our effective adjusted tax rate was approximately 25.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, it is reasonable to assume a tax rate between 25% and 26% for 2023. Turning to capital management, our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $13 billion. This includes the $600 million of senior notes we issued in March. Our next scheduled debt maturity is October, 2023 when $250 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter, totaled $876 million, and included $296 million for dividends, $280 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4 billion of capital in 2023 across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and there are factors in the macro environment that remain supportive of growth. I would also note that while our current outlook contemplates margin expansion in the second quarter, we expect it will be more modest than in the other quarters, reflecting the talent investments we continued to make last year, the timing of annual raises and a continued rebound in expenses such as T&E relative to last year. Overall, our strong start leaves us well positioned for another good year in 2023. Based on our outlook today, for the full year we continue to expect mid-single digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John. Yes. We haven't been terribly specific, but I'll try to be helpful. So in terms of the -- how much hit in the first quarter, I think we took a lot of action in the fourth quarter of last year, as you saw through the size of the charges. So I think it's probably a reasonable assumption to -- if you wanted to assume a ratable pacing of the 180 to -- or 160 to 180 throughout this year. That's probably not bad. And as John noted earlier, that's net of reinvestments, so that will fall to the bottom line. In terms of split across businesses, we haven't been specific there, but you could look at the proportion of charges in some of our disclosures and make a rough approximation there as well. And so I think ratable spreading of the 160 to 180 through this year is not a bad way to go. Yes, of course. Well, John, as you said, it's not a good day for our clients. And our focus is on obviously getting the best deals for our clients and making sure that they stay with us and they understand we're driving innovation where we can. It's the 22nd quarter of consecutive rate increases. You highlighted property, and that did, look, as that picked up momentum again into Q1 it accelerated from 7% rate increases we reported in Q4 2022 to 10% this year. And in addition to that, from a premium perspective, there's clear inflation and exposure growth as well, so real pain for the clients. It doesn't necessarily flow through to our business as a good chunk of that high-risk business with high cat business is fee-based and so it provides us stability there. Other lines of business is being driven by social inflation. Casualty would have been higher, but the workers' compensation, which is pretty flat and it's pretty well around the world. The one area where there has been deceleration in price increases has been in the financial product areas, not just the SPAC and de-SPAC, but also some declines in D&O pricing, driven by the fact, there are 20 new carriers that have come into the marketplace over the last year. But actually, the professional intensity lines are robust, and that's really a function of a prior year action deterioration in the professional lines as social inflation drives that. So it's a bit of a mixed picture. But that's the highlight in terms of growth has been properly, and the rest is seeming to stabilize a little bit."

            "name": "Martine Ferland",
            "content": "Yes. No, thank you, John and indeed, we're very pleased with our results, 7% overall and following a 6% Q1 last year, it's across all the regions. And I would say, there's the current macroeconomic environment is really supportive of the services that we bring to market. Our inflation and interest rate, volatile capital market, well-funded defined benefit plans, tight labor markets, demand for digital health services, new ways of working. And we've made quite a lot of investments as well in clear strategy, client segmentation, much more focused their investment in talent, in digital tools and intellectual capital. And therefore, I would say that these market conditions, combined with the clarity of our strategy, our investment, are conducive to this kind of growth. The pipeline that we see, the sales that we are entering Q2 with is strong, and we have good visibility in the next quarter and probably a little bit over. Of course, we're always monitoring the macroeconomic conditions, as we've discussed with Oliver Wyman. But over the years, we've also invested in diversifying our portfolio towards faster growth elements and more recurring businesses in the portfolio. So it looks solid for continuity in the year. Yes. No, my pleasure to do so. Thanks for the question, Robert. It was a good quarter for defined benefit business. And basically, the market condition, the volatility, there's a lot that we can do to help clients navigate through these changes. And I'm pretty proud of the team that has been quite innovative and proactive in addressing these challenges. With the rise of interest rate, even though the asset side of the pension plans are depressed through equity, we've seen a great improvement in the funding of these plans. And when the funding of these plans become better a lot of our clients looked for ways to divest the liabilities and assets to insurers. So we're seeing activities there in the buyout space, and that has fueled the DB Consulting business. So that being said, of course, the DB segment itself on the market is in structural decline. So underneath this, you'll continue to see this. But in the meantime, with the volatility, it does require quite a lot of work, and we're happy to help clients through these times. The other side of that equation in retirement is also the investment side. On the Consulting side, again, we were very busy helping through the volatility, the decline in equity, et cetera. And our OCIO business, which is directly related, we're taking basis points up of the value of assets as a way to pay for the services we render and of course, when the value of assets are depressed, our revenue goes down. But we have net flows into that business. It's a business that has very good long-term growth through net flows through return. It's just been a more difficult period over the last year and a half. We're seeing still quarter-over-quarter like year-over-year headwinds, because the decline in market really started later in Q2 and then through Q3 last year. So that pressure on the year-over-year basis should ease out at current if the current AUM value stay at current level, we should see that starting to turn around in Q3. You're absolutely right. There's also another element within Health that distinguish it from P&C in a way, is that very often our clients are looking to not increase net cost for their employees because they very often share in the cost. So we see a lot of demand for services from our part on a consulting basis to change the design of these plans to come up with digital solutions instead so that we can control the cost. So the inflation is not always directly manifesting itself in the premiums or in the coverage. There's also, as you said John, a good part of our book that is on fees rather than on commission. So overall, there are many different components pushing the pressure because you're absolutely right, the healthcare costs are increasing all over the world, but the reaction from employers is to try to mitigate these costs through innovative solutions."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Third quarter 2024 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most recently comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nJohn Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our third quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Pat Tomlinson of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning for her last quarter as Head of Investor Relations is Sarah DeWitt. We\u2019d like to congratulate Sarah on her new role as Chief Financial Officer of Marsh. Before I get into our results, I\u2019d like to take a moment to comment on Hurricane Helene and Milton, which have devasted communities in Florida and the Southeast United States. These events are first and foremost the human tragedy and our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the storms. Our primary concern has been the wellbeing of our colleagues and their families as well as our clients and we\u2019re actively working to assist in their recovery. While the ultimate insured loss won\u2019t be known for sometime the impact of these storms will be significant and given their wide paths of destruction and close timing they will put enormous pressure on resources available for recovery. Both hurricanes also highlight the meaningful disparity between economic loss and insured loss. According to some estimates, Helene may have the largest multiple of economic to insured loss of any U.S. storm. This protection gap imposes a meaningful burden on the economy, makes near-term recovery more challenging and undercuts resilience. In addition, rising frequency and severity of extreme weather events, higher property values and increased development in cat prone areas are driving the need for greater protection. We and the insurance industry help communities, businesses and governments build resilience to manage these perils. But as these storms highlight, there is opportunity to do more through risk mitigation, event preparedness and alternative solutions such as community based parametric products. Turning to our results, the third quarter marked another milestone for Marsh McLennan. We continue to perform well across our business and we were thrilled to announce the acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services. In the quarter, we generated 5% underlying revenue growth following 10% in the third of last year, reflecting solid execution in RIS and Consulting. We grew adjusted operating income 12%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points, adjusted EPS grew 4% or 11%, excluding a discrete tax benefit in the Q3 of last year and we completed $300 million of share repurchases in the quarter. Turning to McGriff, it is a leading provider of insurance broking and risk management services in the U.S. with approximately $1.3 billion in revenue. I have long admired McGriff. They have excellent leadership, talented colleagues and a track record of strong growth. Their deep specialty and industry capabilities will strengthen the value proposition and expand the reach of Marsh McLennan Agency in the vast and growing middle market segment. McGriff's client focus, culture of collaboration and commitment to excellence and integrity mirror our own. Together, McGriff and MMA will create new opportunities for colleagues to be their best and helping them delivers even greater value to clients. The $7.75 billion transaction will be funded by cash on hand and debt financing. We expect to close by year end, subject to regulatory approval. We would also expect the transaction to be modestly accretive to adjusted EPS, excluding amortization in year one and become more meaningfully accretive in year two and beyond. We have a terrific track record of acquiring and integrating businesses and we are excited to welcome McGriff's over 3,500 colleagues to the company when the deal closes. McGriff has added to what is already an active year for M&A across our business. We are on track record for the largest M&A year in Marsh McLennan's history, with nearly $10 billion of capital committed to acquisitions year to date, including McGriff, Vanguard's U.S. OCIO business, Cardano, Horton and FBBI. These acquisitions highlight our strategy to deploy capital to faster growing segments of our business. As we have said before, we consistently focus on delivering in the near-term, while investing for sustained growth over the long-term. Shifting to the macro environment, the overall backdrop remains supportive of growth despite what continues to be a complex and volatile landscape. Central banks have begun a cycle of easing and consensus views of the likelihood of near-term recession for most major economies are well below where they were coming into the year. We continue to see economic growth across most of our major markets. Inflation remains elevated, but declining. Labor markets remain healthy and the cost of risk in healthcare continues to rise. That said, uncertainty remains with rising geopolitical tensions and continuing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Clients across the world continue to assess the implications of technology advances in AI, the ever persistent threat from cyber-attacks, supply chain risk and the impact of increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events on their businesses. Our talent, expertise and solutions help clients manage challenges and accelerate opportunities to thrive, so we remain positive in our outlook for growth. We are well positioned and have a track record of performing across economic cycles due to the enduring value we bring to clients and the resilience of our business. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index was down 1% overall in the third quarter versus flat in the second quarter. Rates in the U.S. and Latin America were up low-single-digits. Europe was flat, and in the UK, Asia and Pacific rates were down mid-single-digits. Global property rates were down 2% versus flat in the second quarter, however, global casualty rates increased 6% with U.S. excess casualty up approximately 20% in the quarter. Workers' compensation decreased low-single-digits. Global financial and professional liability rates were down 7%, while cyber decreased 6%. In reinsurance, demand continued to rise and capacity remained adequate in the quarter. While it is too early to know the ultimate insured losses from hurricanes Helene and Milton, we expect there to be an impact on 2025 property insurance and reinsurance pricing. Cat bonds, which posted record volume in the first half, remain likely to have elevated issuance activity through year end, driven by a heavy maturity schedule and capacity for casualty programs is expected to be adequate despite concerns over the pace of lost cost inflation. As always, we are helping clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now, let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.63, which is up 4% from a year ago or 11%, excluding a $0.10 discrete tax benefit in the third quarter of last year. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 5%. Underlying revenue grew 6% in RIS and 4% in consulting. Marsh was up 7%. Guy Carpenter 7%, Mercer 5% and Oliver Wyman grew 1%. Overall in the third quarter, adjusted operating income grew 12% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. For the nine months, consolidated revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 12%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $6.93, up 10% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we are well positioned for another great year in 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, the environment remains uncertain and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q3 performance, which demonstrates execution of our strategy and continued momentum across our business. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they deliver to our clients, shareholders and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our momentum continued in the Q3, with solid underlying revenue growth, significant margin expansion and 4% growth in adjusted EPS or 11% excluding a large discrete tax benefit last year. Our consolidated revenue increased 6% to $5.7 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Operating income was $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion up 12%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 22.4%. GAAP EPS was $1.51 adjusted EPS was $1.63. For the first nine months, underlying revenue growth was 7%, adjusted operating income grew 12% to $4.9 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 28% and adjusted EPS increased 10% to $6.93. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $3.5 billion, up 8% from a year ago or 6% on an underlying basis. This result marks the 15th consecutive quarter of 6% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. Note that fiduciary income was $138 million in the quarter and looking ahead to the Q4, we expect to see this amount decline by approximately $30 million reflecting recent rate cuts and a seasonal drop in fiduciary assets. Operating income in RIS increased 15% to $733 million. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $775 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 24.7%. For the first nine months, revenue in RIS was $11.7 billion underlying growth of 8%. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $3.7 billion and margin increased 100 basis points to 33.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 9% from a year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 8% growth in the Q3 of last year. Growth in the Q3 was broad based and reflected solid retention and new business growth. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 6% for the quarter led by strong growth in MMA and in Victor, our MGA business. In international, underlying growth was 7% and comes on top of 10% in the Q3 of last year. Latin America was up 8%, EMEA was up 7% and Asia Pacific was up 5%. First nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $9.2 billion with underlying growth of 7%. U.S. and Canada grew 7% and international was up 7%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $381 million in the quarter, up 6% or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in international including global specialties. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $2.2 billion of revenue and 8% underlying growth. In the consulting segment third quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, up 3% from a year ago or 4% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $462 million and adjusted operating income was $478 million, up 7%. Our adjusted operating margin in consulting was 21.7% in the third quarter, an increase of 90 basis points. The first nine months consulting revenue was $6.7 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $1.3 billion and our adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 20.7%. Mercer's revenue was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's 14th consecutive quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth. Health underlying growth remains strong at 8% and reflected growth across all regions. Career grew 5%, where we saw strong growth in rewards and talent strategy. Wealth grew 4% driven by continued demand and defined benefits consulting and growth and investment management. Our assets under management at the end of the third quarter rose to $548 billion, up significantly from the third quarter of last year and up 11% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by the impact of capital markets, our transaction with Vanguard and positive net flows. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $4.3 billion with 6% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $810 million, up 1% on an underlying basis. This reflects a tough comparison to 12% growth in the third quarter of last year and softness in certain geographies. We currently see this trend extending into the fourth quarter. The first nine months of the year revenue at Oliver Wyman was $2.4 billion, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. Foreign exchange had very little impact on earnings in the third quarter, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels we also expect minimal FX impact in the fourth quarter. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $78 million. These included $54 million of restructuring costs mostly related to the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as some transaction related charges. Our other net benefit credit was $68 million in the quarter. For the full year 2024 we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $270 million. Interest expense in the third quarter was $154 million, up from $145 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $151 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter, excluding any amounts related to the McGriff transaction. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.7% compared with 20.5% in the third quarter of last year. Our tax rate last year included the release of evaluation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets. Excluding discrete items our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 26.5% for 2024. Turning to our McGriff transaction. McGriff is a terrific company with excellent leadership, a culture similar to MMA's, a diversified business mix, presence in faster growing U.S. markets and a strong track record of performance. We will be paying $7.75 billion in cash consideration, funded by a combination of cash on hand and new debt and we expect to close by year end subject to regulatory approval. As part of the transaction, we expect to assume a deferred tax asset valued at approximately $500 million. As we've noted in the past, we maintain considerable balance sheet flexibility to position us for this type of opportunity. We've secured a committed bridge loan facility for the full amount of the purchase price and currently plan to replace these commitments with permanent financing in the Q4 as we get closer to closing. Based on our outlook today, we expect to raise $7.25 billion in new debt to fund the transaction. We value our high quality ratings and we were pleased that all three rating agencies recently affirmed our current ratings with no changes in outlook. The financial and capital management plan contemplated in the transaction is not only consistent with maintaining our current ratings, but we also expect to have meaningful flexibility for capital deployment next year. Although initially our leverage ratios will increase, the substantial cash flow we expect to generate as well as increased debt capacity through earnings growth will enable us to bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels necessary to maintain a strong ratings profile. As a result, while we intend to pause share repurchases in the fourth quarter, as we think about capital management into next year, we expect we will maintain our balanced approach that includes increasing our dividend and reducing our share count each year as well as continuing to fund high quality acquisitions. We will obviously have more guidance around our outlook for capital deployment in 2025 on our Q4 earnings call early next year. As John noted, we expect the transaction will be modestly accretive to adjusted EPS excluding amortization in year one becoming more meaningfully accretive in year two and beyond. This transaction is a great reflection of several elements of our capital management strategy, maintaining flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, a bias to reinvest capital for growth and delivering in the near-term, while challenging ourselves to invest to sustain growth into the future. Earnings capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $12.8 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the first of 2025, when $500 million of senior notes mature. We currently expect to deploy approximately $4.2 billion of capital in 2024 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases excluding the McGriff transaction. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.8 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.1 billion and included $404 million for dividends, $435 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $3.3 billion included $1.1 billion for dividends, $1.3 billion for acquisitions and $900 million for share repurchases. I want to spend a minute on our plans to change how we report adjusted EPS. Starting next year, we will exclude the impact of acquisition related amortization from adjusted EPS. We will also exclude the other net benefit credit, another non-cash item. These changes will improve the comparability of our results and give investors a better sense of our core earnings power. They will also conform our adjusted EPS reporting with how we report adjusted operating margins. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and the current environment remains supportive of growth. Overall, we are well positioned for another great year in 2024. Based on our outlook today for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we're ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the McGriff deal, when you guys say right, that you expect it\u2019s accretive to earnings less intangibles, what are your -- can you give us some color on what your assumptions are for revenue growth relative to the $1.3 billion that you're taking on? And then also what are you assuming for margin, I guess my questions for the year one guide, but any guide you kind of want to give us for year two and beyond would be helpful as well.\nJohn Doyle: I just want to reiterate how excited we are to bring welcome McGriff into the family. Obviously, it is subject to regulatory approval, they have a really strong culture. It's a competitive group, they're so client focused. I spoke to the talent in my prepared remarks and they'll extend our reach into, it's a vast and fragmented middle market. They have excellent specialty capabilities and industry focus. And working together with MMA, we know they can drive better outcomes for clients and we can create new opportunities for their colleagues as well. So we're excited about all that. We've shared the details that we're going to share about the business, like other MMA transactions, we don't disclose their margins when we acquire them or for that matter how they're growing or -- but we're excited about it. As I said, it'll be modestly accretive in year one. And more so, after that and we expect to earn a good return on the investment over time. So there are synergies of course, but we're conservative in our modeling and we're very excited about what the combination can mean.\nElyse Greenspan: And then my follow up on U.S. and Canada growth was 6% again this quarter. Can you just give us a sense of some of the dynamics that you're seeing within that market and then relative to like the IPO and SPAC in that business, right? That's been a headwind for a couple years. Have you seen any improvement there in the quarter?\nJohn Doyle: Sure. I'd start Elyse just with overall I'm very pleased with our underlying growth in the quarter. I thought we had a terrific quarter. Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Mercer all had terrific growth. And it was really widespread. It was across all regions and practices and so we felt good about that. We obviously had a softer quarter of growth at Oliver Wyman. But overall, I thought the growth was good and we're well positioned. I spoke to the macro environment, it is shifting and changing. And obviously, interest rates have begun to come down in some major economies around the world and that's meant some new opportunity in SPACs and IPOs and well, maybe not SPACs, but IPOs and M&A activity, we're starting to pick up a bit. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about the U.S. marketplace and some of the opportunities we're seeing.\nMartin South : Sure, John. As you said, very pleased with underlying growth of 7%, which is kind of in line with 8% in 3Q '23 and 3Q '22, very good balance of growth across international and in the U.S., but I'll double-click a little bit on the U.S. performed very well, 6% on top of 6% in Q3. We saw very good growth from MMA and Vector. And to Elyse\u2019s question, we did see double-digit growth in the capital markets and MMA products. Construction & Aviation performed well and globally, very strong growth in our benefits business as well. So overall, pleased with that good momentum and expect that to continue.\nJohn Doyle : Double-digit growth at least in capital markets, of course, is off a lower base, right, after a couple of years of a soft environment there. So thank you for your questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar : So first, I just had a question following up on your comments on Milton and its impact on the market. So, just specifically on reinsurance. Just wondering what your expectations are on how Milton affects renewals? And should one assume that prices could actually go up or they're just going to go down given the high loss.\nJohn Doyle : Yes. I think, Jimmy, at the end of the day, it's too early to know that at this point. There's obviously a range of estimates out there and the ranges are quite wide. And so there's still a lot for us to learn, many property owners are just getting to their facilities at this point. And so, I spoke about the overall economic impact to the Southeast and what it means to those communities at a human level as well, it's going to be a challenging recovery and it's going to extend for a bit of period of time. Maybe I could ask Dean to comment a little bit about where we're expecting in advance of those storms? And any thoughts he has on the impact it might have. Dean?\nDean Klisura : Yes. Thanks, John. And Jimmy, as we entered the kind of fall conference season ahead of Helen and Milton, I think our clients and we anticipated a very competitive market environment at the upcoming January 1 property cat renewal. I think post Milton, it's still early, but I think we see a flattening of pricing in the property cat market at the upcoming January 1 renewal. If you think about kind of lower and mid-level layers and programs, we kind of see risk -adjusted flattish at this point without all the data in, and you could still see some softening, some rate reductions in more remote risk layers and property cat towers. As John said, keep in mind, it's early. We're still in wind season. There could be additional cat events over the next several weeks that would shape the market. And as John noted, it will be several weeks before we have sufficient claims data to make accurate loss estimates and those impacts on our clients. And right now, we're just relying on all of our cat modeling partners to come up with some of those estimates. But to sum it up, Jimmy, I would say, overall, property cat demand should increase at January 1 from our clients. We think capacity in the marketplace will be adequate. We think the renewal will be manageable for most of our clients. The market is well capitalized to trade forward and meets client demand. And keep in mind, I think the headline, Jimmy, is the major of the cat losses this year will be borne by our clients given the high attachment points that were imposed on that after Hurricane Ian two years ago.\nJohn Doyle : Thank you Dean. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up?\nJimmy Bhullar : Just on Oliver Wyman. Obviously, the comps were tough as well, but you noted seeing weakness in some geographic regions. Was that a function of the economy? Or is there something else that's affecting results in the areas that you mentioned.\nJohn Doyle : Yes, sure. 1%, obviously, underlying was softer than we'd planned for. It was a tough comp and we're up 5% year-to-date. And what I would also say is, I mentioned to you in the past, there's going to be more volatility quarter-to-quarter at Oliver Wyman. We do expect higher underlying revenue growth from Oliver Wyman over the medium- to long-term. But Nick, maybe you could share some insights on what you're seeing in the market.\nNick Studer : Thank you, Jimmy. We often say this is a mid- to high-single-digit business through the cycle. And I think it's fair to say we're at a low point in the cycle. And we've talked for a few quarters now about that being a tough market and we do see that continuing. Maybe at a macro level, I'd just note, we're more than 50% larger than we were pre-pandemic. We're 2/3 larger than that pandemic year. And I think we are consolidating those gains in that tough market. But for the quarter itself, no one likes a one, no one likes a one following a three. They were at 12 and 11 comp. Thank you for noting that in the question. When we look at the year as a whole, we're five, I think I do want to note we're on the front foot inorganically as well because there are parts of our business where scale does matter. And so the business is 8% larger than in the same periods first three quarters of last year. And that represents a form of progress. We've seen very strong growth in Asia and the Pacific region, bouncing back from a tougher period, our India, Middle East and Africa business continues to grow. The regional softness has been more in the Americas and in Europe. I think some of that is linked to the economy, but also just corporate buying habits given uncertainty in the Americas, maybe in the U.S., particularly some waiting for the election. Sector-wise, our best growth has been in our communications, media and technology practice. Our insurance and asset management practice growing very strongly. Automotive and manufacturing doing well and our large banking practice continuing to be pretty robust. But overall, we see it as being a relatively tough market, which we'll continue to work our way through.\nJohn Doyle : Thank you, Jimmy for your questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nGreg Peters : I guess for my first question, I'd like to focus on the free cash flow results. I was looking in the statement of cash flows, operating cash flow through the nine months, down a little bit, not growing in line with revenue. And just -- I'm sure there's some puts and takes in there. Just some color there would be helpful.\nJohn Doyle : Yes. Sure, Greg. As we've noted in the past, there's going to be more volatility to free cash flow growth, certainly than our earnings growth. But Mark, maybe you could share some color.\nMark McGivney : Yes, just I'll repeat that John. We -- free cash flow is something that is volatile quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. So best looked at over long stretches of time. Our track record in free cash flow growth, as we've noted before has been terrific. So we're a double-digit free cash flow growth for a decade plus. And that's what you'd expect for a company that's grown its EPS double-digits given our high cash generation capital type model. There's no story in the results year-to-date. So free cash flow is down. Year-to-date was up 28% last year. It was actually up in the third quarter. So what you're seeing year-to-date is just a number of factors that caused this period-to-period volatility. So we had higher variable compensation payouts in the first quarter because of our strong results last year. Receivables are up because of growth and it's just a little bit of business mix and timing. And there's just a handful of one-timers in last year's period, this period that affect the year-over-year comparison. So overall, we have an outlook for continued strong growth in earnings, and therefore, our free cash flow growth into the future should be strong as well.\nJohn Doyle : Thanks Mark. Greg, do you have a follow-up?\nGreg Peters : Yes. Mark, in your comments, I think you mentioned something about fiduciary income and interest income and you provided some guidance. And I'm wondering if you could just -- you guys are flying through so many comments. If you could just revisit those comments and sort of -- I think you're framing it for fourth quarter. And if we could push it out and sort of frame it for next year or two for us would be helpful.\nMark McGivney : Yes, sure. Let me repeat what I said. We did have a lot in the script this quarter. So we just wanted to flag that as we look into the fourth quarter, we typically see, especially in Guy Carpenter, just given the seasonality of their revenue with so much activity in the first half, we do see fiduciary balances that tend to fall off in the fourth quarter. So we do expect fiduciary income to be $30 million or so lower in the fourth quarter from the level we saw in the third quarter. And it's a combination of the rate cuts that have happened and the impact that they will have as well as the seasonal drop in fiduciary balances. We look out to 2025, it's really going to depend on what rate actions happen from here. What happens in the balance of this year, what happens since the next year. And so we're going to stay away from speculating there, but just to repeat some of the things we've said in the past. The math is pretty straightforward. So we've got roughly $11.5 billion of balances on average these days. And so you can use that as a basis to try to do some sensitivity analysis around what that could mean to fiduciary income. There would be some offsets. There are -- there is some interplay with some of our variable compensation programs. We obviously would pay less in terms of interest on short-term debt. But we'll just have to wait and see what happens with further cuts as we look into next year.\nJohn Doyle : Greg, I would just add, we're accustomed to operating in a lower rate environment. So we'll adjust our plans accordingly. I will likely be an increasing headwind for us into 2025. And we model out the various scenarios, not just from this headwind but from other headwinds as well. And so we make plans accordingly. But a lower rate environment could also or likely will impact other parts of our business as well. We touched on increasing transaction risk as a result of higher volume in M&A markets, IPOs, construction, Mercer Wealth, of course, overall, our cost of capital will be impacted as well. So there'll be lots of ins and outs from a lower rate environment and we're working our way through all those issues.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\nMike Zaremski : First question on the -- thanks for the update on the Marsh pricing index, which moved to negative 1 territory, I believe. Can you help tease out how this index and kind of pricing in this marketplace is having an impact on Marsh's organic growth? I know that there's an element of fees and then commissions as well. But is this -- is the index as it's decelerated in the last year or so, has it had any material impact on your Marsh's rate of organic growth?\nJohn Doyle : Look, first of all, Mike, what I would say is that the markets overall, on average are stable. Insurers have picked up quite a bit of price over the course of the last several years. So minus 1 was some welcome relief, at least for many of our clients at Marsh after what's been a tough pricing environment. Of course, price is ultimately a reflection of the cost of risk over time. And so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the cost of risk continues to escalate. About half of our business at Marsh is sensitive to our revenue. That is a sensitive to P&C pricing through commission. The rest of it, of course, is on a fee. And it's not a direct line. You have buying habits change as markets soften a bit and the risk environment changes. You may have clients retain less risk than they had over the course of the last few years. We've talked on prior calls, for example, about the growth in our captives business, the premium and the captives that we manage have been growing faster than the premiums that we see into the marketplace. If the market continues to get a bit more competitive, that may change. So obviously, it has an impact, but it's not a straight line from price. What I would also point out to you is that our index is skewed to large accounts and that the middle market pricing is more stable and it's up low to mid-single digits. I hope that's helpful. Do you have a follow-up?\nMike Zaremski : Yes, a quick follow-up. I'll stick with your pricing commentary. Hopefully, other people asked about Mercer Health being strong. But so U.S., I believe, you said was plus 20, that's a pretty big number. Maybe you can talk about whether there's dislocation in that marketplace? Or what's going on? Is it going to be moved to the E&S market? Or maybe that's not even in maybe just anything -- any color you could add that seems like that's a number that's distressed for certain some of your clients.\nJohn Doyle : Yes. I'm sure, Mike, on the last call, in fact, I talked about some real troubling signs in the U.S. liability market. Maybe I'll ask Martin to share some insights on what we're seeing in that marketplace.\nMartinSouth : Yes. Thank you, John I'll just start with a comment that overall, the composite rating index is up about 1.5x since 2012. The casualty book is up 6% in North America with the excess book up 21%. At the moment, we're not seeing dislocations in that the capacity that clients are requesting we can place, there are smaller limits that insurers have and we're doing jobs to think what we can do to place quota share programs for our clients to avoid compression of limits. And so we don't see anything too sinister in terms of supply for clients at this point. Certainly, there's been a movement to the E&S market and we're big players in that space. And that segment of the market has grown significantly. There's more agility and rate movement in those areas there. So we're well positioned to help them with that and we're continuing to work with them as our clients deal with some of the social inflation that we've talked about in the past as well. So lots of other services that we need to wrap around that to help our clients navigate this market.\nJohn Doyle : Thank you, Mike, and thank you, Martin.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.\nBrian Meredith : First one for Dean on the reinsurance side. You mentioned that you expect ample capacity in the casualty lines. I'm just curious, can you maybe talk a little bit about how are the reinsurers do you think going to be reacting to this tort inflation that we continue to see in the marketplace at 1/1? Do you think -- we'll see a lot of tightening in terms and conditions. What are you hearing? What are you seeing from them?\nJohn Doyle : Yes. Thanks, Brian. I'll hand it to Dean in a second, but loss cost inflation in casualty lines remains a real challenge for the marketplace overall and we're concerned about it from our clients' perspective and was the talk of conference season, I think in advance of Helene and Milton. So Dean, maybe you could share some thoughts on what you're seeing in reinsurance casualty.\nDean Klisura : Yes. Thanks, John. And Brian, as John said, I think reinsurers generally continue to express great concern about the U.S. casualty reinsurance market focused, in particular, on excess casualty as noted by John and Martin for all the factors we've been discussing. That said, as we head to the 1/1 renewal season, we think current market conditions will largely prevail in the casualty market at 1/1, that said, we continue to see downward pressure on ceding commissions for quota share deals averaging 100 basis points. Therefore, that's a rate increase, excess of loss contracts, more robust rate increases in the 5% to 25% range and maybe many structural changes to get those deals across the line. We do expect adequate capacity in the marketplace, maybe more limited for [XLL] deals. Thus far, these deals are challenging but they're getting done, they're getting across the line in the marketplace. And I really think the key for our clients, as Martin and John have said is going to be the performance of their underlying portfolios. Are they getting underlying rate increases in their books? Are they managing limits in excess casualty and other lines that will be the key formula for successful for renewal. But casualty is challenging right now in the market, but we think it's stable and most deals will get done.\nJohn Doyle : So clear signs of loss cost inflation, loss development patterns disrupted by the impact of the economy and closing of courts during the pandemic and then kind of the economic rebound. So it's challenging for all of us to get our arms around it. And we're obviously doing our best to help clients navigate the uncertainty around it. Brian, do you have a follow-up?\nBrian Meredith : Yes, absolutely, John. And I know we've talked about this before, but maybe just your perspective on the business continuing to flow to the non-admitted market. Do you think that's slowing here? And then also, how can Marsh kind of react to that to mitigate that or maybe recapture share? And does McGriff have anything that could potentially help you benefit you in the non-admitted area?\nJohn Doyle : To be clear, we're not losing share as a result of the growth in the E&S market in the United States, you're seeing -- you have seen and observed outsized growth in wholesale broking as a result of that. But we have access to those markets and we'll access that capital if it's the right solution for our clients. Generally, we prefer admitted solutions for our clients given kind of what comes with being an admitted insurer. So our strategy is about accessing as much of the market directly, including E&S insurers as possible. And overwhelmingly, the E&S premium that we place into the market today, we do directly today, right? So to be clear. In terms of market growth, future market growth, it's hard to say, but -- and I certainly understand in this dynamic risk environment, certainly multichannel insurers that have both admitted and non-admitted, why they want to use more non-admitted solutions, it gives them more flexibility to react more quickly to the changing risk environment. So I understand that. Again, our focus is accessing capital as directly as possible and as efficiently as possible so we can continue to drive the best solutions for our clients. We'll continue to use wholesale brokers, but for niche expertise where they serve us and our client well. So anyway, that's really how we see it, Brian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Grace Carter with Bank of America.\nGrace Carter : I was hoping to ask a couple of cleanup questions regarding McGriff. Is there any possibility that you all might give us some of the below-the-line impacts, like, how much you're thinking amortization might increase associated with the deal? And any sort of transaction or integration expenses that we should expect over the next few quarters?\nJohn Doyle : No, we're not prepared to do that. As I said, it's typical MMA transactions. So we haven't disclosed margins or the underlying performance of the businesses other than I will say, we're very impressed with the performance of McGriff. It's had strong underlying revenue growth. Sales velocity is quite strong as well, very similar to the performance of MMA.\nGrace Carter : And I guess on the tax rate, I know it's a bit early to be looking at next year, but just kind of considering how the geographic mix of the business might be impacted by the deal. I mean is kind of the 25% to 26.5% original guide for this year still kind of fair to assume. And while we're on the subject of tax, if you could help us maybe think about the time line for utilizing the DTA that you're getting?\nJohn Doyle : We're not going to guide to 2025. We'll talk about that in January on the call. So Mark, anything else to share on tax overall?\nMark Christopher : Just to your question on the deferred tax assets. So the value I talked about is the present value of the future tax deduction stream that we affect and that is going to go out over a long period of time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRob Cox : Appreciate that it's the largest MMA year in MMC's history. I'm curious if the price you're paying for top 100 brokers has changed your thought process at all on relative capital deployment across the different avenues.\nJohn Doyle : Look, we've talked about our approach to capital management. We favor investing in the business over buybacks. We -- as you know, aspire to be -- to raise our dividend each and every year as well. We have a responsibility, obviously, to be good stewards of our capital. So we are -- although multiples have increased over the course of the last several years, we have great confidence in our ability to earn a return well in excess of our cost of capital. And so should that change or should we see a deal that doesn't accomplish those objectives. We'll deploy capital elsewhere. But we have a very strong reputation as a buyer in the marketplace. We spend a lot of time game planning various scenarios from small to mid-sized kind of tuck-in store business to more material deals like McGriff and we're very well positioned in that marketplace. Mark talked about even after McGriff, we maintain a lot of flexibility if we see the opportunity to make -- not make ourselves not just bigger but better as a business going forward. So that's our approach. Do you have a follow-up, Rob?\nRob Cox : Yes, I just wanted to ask a question on something that I feel like doesn't get a lot of airtime, but I was hoping to get an update on the commission rates and fee rates in the brokerage operations. Is there anything you can tell us about how these take rates have changed over the course of the hard market in recent years? And if not, what's driving the stability?\nJohn Doyle : I actually -- I don't view the last several years as a hard market, right? Just to start with that. I thought what we observed as challenging it was for our retail clients at Marsh was largely kind of a catch-up period for insurers on average to catch up with the accelerating loss cost. Not to say certain markets in a shorter period of time were challenging. For example, when ransomware picked up in the cyber market and the underwriting community have not really priced for that kind of risk, the market jumped pretty quickly, but then it settled quite quickly as well. And in fact, the market is coming back in favor of our retail clients a bit at the moment. So I would start with that. But over a fairly extended period of time, our average commission rates at Marsh have remained fairly stable. From product line to product line, there's some movement, but for the most part average acquisition expense through Marsh has been pretty constant.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen.\nAndrew Kligerman : Your underlying growth in RIS is nothing shy of outstanding. And we looked last year at double-digit underlying growth this year, it's kind of decelerated down to 6%, which is still excellent, but the question for you going forward and I know you guide to mid-single-digit or better underlying growth across businesses. So what kind of gives you the confidence that it kind of holds in this kind of zone, maybe even slightly less and doesn't decelerate further?\nJohn Doyle : We always have time for you, Andrew, just to be clear. Look, as I mentioned in our -- in my prepared remarks, the macro environment remains supportive of growth overall, but we're in this elevated risk environment, geopolitical risk, frequency and severity of weather, cyber events, loss cost inflation, all those things creating opportunities for us to help clients. And pricing has moderated but markets have been disciplined overall. And we've been very focused on building and adding to our capabilities, right? And McGriff is kind of the latest example of that. We're investing organically and inorganically. We've been reshaping the mix of our business over time, right? So McGriff is another example of deploying capital into the faster-growing middle market. I would also note that we're working together better than we ever have as well. That's driving some real growth opportunities for us as well. So again, we'll guide around 2025 in January. But I feel like we're executing well and in this elevated risk environment. There's real opportunities for us to continue to drive good growth in our business.\nAndrew Kligerman : And you just touched on the faster growth in MMA. Any color, John, that you could provide around how much it outpaces large corporate business.\nJohn Doyle : Yes. I mean we're not going to disclose kind of segment growth, but it is higher. It's over time. And by the way, not in every quarter and in every year for that matter over the course of the last several years has it outpaced the upmarket growth at Marsh, but it's been a more consistent growth business for us. And what really excites me about that marketplace is how we can bring scale benefits to clients really at a different level. So -- and I think McGriff is a great example. It's a terrific business with outstanding fundamentals, terrific leadership outstanding talent all throughout its business. And we've shown, and as we've brought firms into MMA, we can make them even stronger. We can bring capabilities from MMA and Marsh to help them better serve clients. So we are excited about that.\nJohn Doyle : So thank you. Andrew, I appreciate the questions. And Andrew, I think we'll wrap up the call at this point given that we're having a fire alarm in our building. So I want to thank you all for joining us on the call. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. So thank you all and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This does conclude today's program, and you may now disconnect.",

On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Pat Tomlinson of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning for her last quarter as Head of Investor Relations is Sarah DeWitt. We'd like to congratulate Sarah on her new role as Chief Financial Officer of Marsh. Before I get into our results, I'd like to take a moment to comment on Hurricane Helene and Milton, which have devasted communities in Florida and the Southeast United States. These events are first and foremost the human tragedy and our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the storms. Our primary concern has been the wellbeing of our colleagues and their families as well as our clients and we're actively working to assist in their recovery. While the ultimate insured loss won't be known for sometime the impact of these storms will be significant and given their wide paths of destruction and close timing they will put enormous pressure on resources available for recovery. Both hurricanes also highlight the meaningful disparity between economic loss and insured loss. According to some estimates, Helene may have the largest multiple of economic to insured loss of any U.S. storm. This protection gap imposes a meaningful burden on the economy, makes near-term recovery more challenging and undercuts resilience. In addition, rising frequency and severity of extreme weather events, higher property values and increased development in cat prone areas are driving the need for greater protection. We and the insurance industry help communities, businesses and governments build resilience to manage these perils. But as these storms highlight, there is opportunity to do more through risk mitigation, event preparedness and alternative solutions such as community based parametric products. Turning to our results, the third quarter marked another milestone for Marsh McLennan. We continue to perform well across our business and we were thrilled to announce the acquisition of McGriff Insurance Services. In the quarter, we generated 5% underlying revenue growth following 10% in the third of last year, reflecting solid execution in RIS and Consulting. We grew adjusted operating income 12%. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points, adjusted EPS grew 4% or 11%, excluding a discrete tax benefit in the Q3 of last year and we completed $300 million of share repurchases in the quarter. Turning to McGriff, it is a leading provider of insurance broking and risk management services in the U.S. with approximately $1.3 billion in revenue. I have long admired McGriff. They have excellent leadership, talented colleagues and a track record of strong growth. Their deep specialty and industry capabilities will strengthen the value proposition and expand the reach of Marsh McLennan Agency in the vast and growing middle market segment. McGriff's client focus, culture of collaboration and commitment to excellence and integrity mirror our own. Together, McGriff and MMA will create new opportunities for colleagues to be their best and helping them delivers even greater value to clients. The $7.75 billion transaction will be funded by cash on hand and debt financing. We expect to close by year end, subject to regulatory approval. We would also expect the transaction to be modestly accretive to adjusted EPS, excluding amortization in year one and become more meaningfully accretive in year two and beyond. We have a terrific track record of acquiring and integrating businesses and we are excited to welcome McGriff's over 3,500 colleagues to the company when the deal closes. McGriff has added to what is already an active year for M&A across our business. We are on track record for the largest M&A year in Marsh McLennan's history, with nearly $10 billion of capital committed to acquisitions year to date, including McGriff, Vanguard's U.S. OCIO business, Cardano, Horton and FBBI. These acquisitions highlight our strategy to deploy capital to faster growing segments of our business. As we have said before, we consistently focus on delivering in the near-term, while investing for sustained growth over the long-term. Shifting to the macro environment, the overall backdrop remains supportive of growth despite what continues to be a complex and volatile landscape. Central banks have begun a cycle of easing and consensus views of the likelihood of near-term recession for most major economies are well below where they were coming into the year. We continue to see economic growth across most of our major markets. Inflation remains elevated, but declining. Labor markets remain healthy and the cost of risk in healthcare continues to rise. That said, uncertainty remains with rising geopolitical tensions and continuing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. Clients across the world continue to assess the implications of technology advances in AI, the ever persistent threat from cyber-attacks, supply chain risk and the impact of increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events on their businesses. Our talent, expertise and solutions help clients manage challenges and accelerate opportunities to thrive, so we remain positive in our outlook for growth. We are well positioned and have a track record of performing across economic cycles due to the enduring value we bring to clients and the resilience of our business. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index was down 1% overall in the third quarter versus flat in the second quarter. Rates in the U.S. and Latin America were up low-single-digits. Europe was flat, and in the UK, Asia and Pacific rates were down mid-single-digits. Global property rates were down 2% versus flat in the second quarter, however, global casualty rates increased 6% with U.S. excess casualty up approximately 20% in the quarter. Workers' compensation decreased low-single-digits. Global financial and professional liability rates were down 7%, while cyber decreased 6%. In reinsurance, demand continued to rise and capacity remained adequate in the quarter. While it is too early to know the ultimate insured losses from hurricanes Helene and Milton, we expect there to be an impact on 2025 property insurance and reinsurance pricing. Cat bonds, which posted record volume in the first half, remain likely to have elevated issuance activity through year end, driven by a heavy maturity schedule and capacity for casualty programs is expected to be adequate despite concerns over the pace of lost cost inflation. As always, we are helping clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now, let me turn to our third quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.63, which is up 4% from a year ago or 11%, excluding a $0.10 discrete tax benefit in the third quarter of last year. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 5%. Underlying revenue grew 6% in RIS and 4% in consulting. Marsh was up 7%. Guy Carpenter 7%, Mercer 5% and Oliver Wyman grew 1%. Overall in the third quarter, adjusted operating income grew 12% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. For the nine months, consolidated revenue grew 7% on an underlying basis. Adjusted operating income grew 12%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points. Adjusted EPS was $6.93, up 10% from a year ago. Turning to our outlook, we are well positioned for another great year in 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, the environment remains uncertain and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. Overall, I'm pleased with our Q3 performance, which demonstrates execution of our strategy and continued momentum across our business. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination and the value they deliver to our clients, shareholders and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we're ready to begin Q&A. I just want to reiterate how excited we are to bring welcome McGriff into the family. Obviously, it is subject to regulatory approval, they have a really strong culture. It's a competitive group, they're so client focused. I spoke to the talent in my prepared remarks and they'll extend our reach into, it's a vast and fragmented middle market. They have excellent specialty capabilities and industry focus. And working together with MMA, we know they can drive better outcomes for clients and we can create new opportunities for their colleagues as well. So we're excited about all that. We've shared the details that we're going to share about the business, like other MMA transactions, we don't disclose their margins when we acquire them or for that matter how they're growing or -- but we're excited about it. As I said, it'll be modestly accretive in year one. And more so, after that and we expect to earn a good return on the investment over time. So there are synergies of course, but we're conservative in our modeling and we're very excited about what the combination can mean. Sure. I'd start Elyse just with overall I'm very pleased with our underlying growth in the quarter. I thought we had a terrific quarter. Marsh, Guy Carpenter and Mercer all had terrific growth. And it was really widespread. It was across all regions and practices and so we felt good about that. We obviously had a softer quarter of growth at Oliver Wyman. But overall, I thought the growth was good and we're well positioned. I spoke to the macro environment, it is shifting and changing. And obviously, interest rates have begun to come down in some major economies around the world and that's meant some new opportunity in SPACs and IPOs and well, maybe not SPACs, but IPOs and M&A activity, we're starting to pick up a bit. But Martin, maybe you could talk a little bit about the U.S. marketplace and some of the opportunities we're seeing. Double-digit growth at least in capital markets, of course, is off a lower base, right, after a couple of years of a soft environment there. So thank you for your questions. Yes. I think, Jimmy, at the end of the day, it's too early to know that at this point. There's obviously a range of estimates out there and the ranges are quite wide. And so there's still a lot for us to learn, many property owners are just getting to their facilities at this point. And so, I spoke about the overall economic impact to the Southeast and what it means to those communities at a human level as well, it's going to be a challenging recovery and it's going to extend for a bit of period of time. Maybe I could ask Dean to comment a little bit about where we're expecting in advance of those storms? And any thoughts he has on the impact it might have. Dean? Thank you Dean. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up? Yes, sure. 1%, obviously, underlying was softer than we'd planned for. It was a tough comp and we're up 5% year-to-date. And what I would also say is, I mentioned to you in the past, there's going to be more volatility quarter-to-quarter at Oliver Wyman. We do expect higher underlying revenue growth from Oliver Wyman over the medium- to long-term. But Nick, maybe you could share some insights on what you're seeing in the market. Thank you, Jimmy for your questions. Yes. Sure, Greg. As we've noted in the past, there's going to be more volatility to free cash flow growth, certainly than our earnings growth. But Mark, maybe you could share some color. Thanks Mark. Greg, do you have a follow-up? Greg, I would just add, we're accustomed to operating in a lower rate environment. So we'll adjust our plans accordingly. I will likely be an increasing headwind for us into 2025. And we model out the various scenarios, not just from this headwind but from other headwinds as well. And so we make plans accordingly. But a lower rate environment could also or likely will impact other parts of our business as well. We touched on increasing transaction risk as a result of higher volume in M&A markets, IPOs, construction, Mercer Wealth, of course, overall, our cost of capital will be impacted as well. So there'll be lots of ins and outs from a lower rate environment and we're working our way through all those issues. Look, first of all, Mike, what I would say is that the markets overall, on average are stable. Insurers have picked up quite a bit of price over the course of the last several years. So minus 1 was some welcome relief, at least for many of our clients at Marsh after what's been a tough pricing environment. Of course, price is ultimately a reflection of the cost of risk over time. And so as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the cost of risk continues to escalate. About half of our business at Marsh is sensitive to our revenue. That is a sensitive to P&C pricing through commission. The rest of it, of course, is on a fee. And it's not a direct line. You have buying habits change as markets soften a bit and the risk environment changes. You may have clients retain less risk than they had over the course of the last few years. We've talked on prior calls, for example, about the growth in our captives business, the premium and the captives that we manage have been growing faster than the premiums that we see into the marketplace. If the market continues to get a bit more competitive, that may change. So obviously, it has an impact, but it's not a straight line from price. What I would also point out to you is that our index is skewed to large accounts and that the middle market pricing is more stable and it's up low to mid-single digits. I hope that's helpful. Do you have a follow-up? Yes. I'm sure, Mike, on the last call, in fact, I talked about some real troubling signs in the U.S. liability market. Maybe I'll ask Martin to share some insights on what we're seeing in that marketplace. Thank you, Mike, and thank you, Martin. Yes. Thanks, Brian. I'll hand it to Dean in a second, but loss cost inflation in casualty lines remains a real challenge for the marketplace overall and we're concerned about it from our clients' perspective and was the talk of conference season, I think in advance of Helene and Milton. So Dean, maybe you could share some thoughts on what you're seeing in reinsurance casualty. So clear signs of loss cost inflation, loss development patterns disrupted by the impact of the economy and closing of courts during the pandemic and then kind of the economic rebound. So it's challenging for all of us to get our arms around it. And we're obviously doing our best to help clients navigate the uncertainty around it. Brian, do you have a follow-up? To be clear, we're not losing share as a result of the growth in the E&S market in the United States, you're seeing -- you have seen and observed outsized growth in wholesale broking as a result of that. But we have access to those markets and we'll access that capital if it's the right solution for our clients. Generally, we prefer admitted solutions for our clients given kind of what comes with being an admitted insurer. So our strategy is about accessing as much of the market directly, including E&S insurers as possible. And overwhelmingly, the E&S premium that we place into the market today, we do directly today, right? So to be clear. In terms of market growth, future market growth, it's hard to say, but -- and I certainly understand in this dynamic risk environment, certainly multichannel insurers that have both admitted and non-admitted, why they want to use more non-admitted solutions, it gives them more flexibility to react more quickly to the changing risk environment. So I understand that. Again, our focus is accessing capital as directly as possible and as efficiently as possible so we can continue to drive the best solutions for our clients. We'll continue to use wholesale brokers, but for niche expertise where they serve us and our client well. So anyway, that's really how we see it, Brian. No, we're not prepared to do that. As I said, it's typical MMA transactions. So we haven't disclosed margins or the underlying performance of the businesses other than I will say, we're very impressed with the performance of McGriff. It's had strong underlying revenue growth. Sales velocity is quite strong as well, very similar to the performance of MMA. We're not going to guide to 2025. We'll talk about that in January on the call. So Mark, anything else to share on tax overall? Look, we've talked about our approach to capital management. We favor investing in the business over buybacks. We -- as you know, aspire to be -- to raise our dividend each and every year as well. We have a responsibility, obviously, to be good stewards of our capital. So we are -- although multiples have increased over the course of the last several years, we have great confidence in our ability to earn a return well in excess of our cost of capital. And so should that change or should we see a deal that doesn't accomplish those objectives. We'll deploy capital elsewhere. But we have a very strong reputation as a buyer in the marketplace. We spend a lot of time game planning various scenarios from small to mid-sized kind of tuck-in store business to more material deals like McGriff and we're very well positioned in that marketplace. Mark talked about even after McGriff, we maintain a lot of flexibility if we see the opportunity to make -- not make ourselves not just bigger but better as a business going forward. So that's our approach. Do you have a follow-up, Rob? I actually -- I don't view the last several years as a hard market, right? Just to start with that. I thought what we observed as challenging it was for our retail clients at Marsh was largely kind of a catch-up period for insurers on average to catch up with the accelerating loss cost. Not to say certain markets in a shorter period of time were challenging. For example, when ransomware picked up in the cyber market and the underwriting community have not really priced for that kind of risk, the market jumped pretty quickly, but then it settled quite quickly as well. And in fact, the market is coming back in favor of our retail clients a bit at the moment. So I would start with that. But over a fairly extended period of time, our average commission rates at Marsh have remained fairly stable. From product line to product line, there's some movement, but for the most part average acquisition expense through Marsh has been pretty constant. We always have time for you, Andrew, just to be clear. Look, as I mentioned in our -- in my prepared remarks, the macro environment remains supportive of growth overall, but we're in this elevated risk environment, geopolitical risk, frequency and severity of weather, cyber events, loss cost inflation, all those things creating opportunities for us to help clients. And pricing has moderated but markets have been disciplined overall. And we've been very focused on building and adding to our capabilities, right? And McGriff is kind of the latest example of that. We're investing organically and inorganically. We've been reshaping the mix of our business over time, right? So McGriff is another example of deploying capital into the faster-growing middle market. I would also note that we're working together better than we ever have as well. That's driving some real growth opportunities for us as well. So again, we'll guide around 2025 in January. But I feel like we're executing well and in this elevated risk environment. There's real opportunities for us to continue to drive good growth in our business. Yes. I mean we're not going to disclose kind of segment growth, but it is higher. It's over time. And by the way, not in every quarter and in every year for that matter over the course of the last several years has it outpaced the upmarket growth at Marsh, but it's been a more consistent growth business for us. And what really excites me about that marketplace is how we can bring scale benefits to clients really at a different level. So -- and I think McGriff is a great example. It's a terrific business with outstanding fundamentals, terrific leadership outstanding talent all throughout its business. And we've shown, and as we've brought firms into MMA, we can make them even stronger. We can bring capabilities from MMA and Marsh to help them better serve clients. So we are excited about that. So thank you. Andrew, I appreciate the questions. And Andrew, I think we'll wrap up the call at this point given that we're having a fire alarm in our building. So I want to thank you all for joining us on the call. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. So thank you all and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Jimmy. We often say this is a mid- to high-single-digit business through the cycle. And I think it's fair to say we're at a low point in the cycle. And we've talked for a few quarters now about that being a tough market and we do see that continuing. Maybe at a macro level, I'd just note, we're more than 50% larger than we were pre-pandemic. We're 2/3 larger than that pandemic year. And I think we are consolidating those gains in that tough market. But for the quarter itself, no one likes a one, no one likes a one following a three. They were at 12 and 11 comp. Thank you for noting that in the question. When we look at the year as a whole, we're five, I think I do want to note we're on the front foot inorganically as well because there are parts of our business where scale does matter. And so the business is 8% larger than in the same periods first three quarters of last year. And that represents a form of progress. We've seen very strong growth in Asia and the Pacific region, bouncing back from a tougher period, our India, Middle East and Africa business continues to grow. The regional softness has been more in the Americas and in Europe. I think some of that is linked to the economy, but also just corporate buying habits given uncertainty in the Americas, maybe in the U.S., particularly some waiting for the election. Sector-wise, our best growth has been in our communications, media and technology practice. Our insurance and asset management practice growing very strongly. Automotive and manufacturing doing well and our large banking practice continuing to be pretty robust. But overall, we see it as being a relatively tough market, which we'll continue to work our way through."

            "content": "Sure, John. As you said, very pleased with underlying growth of 7%, which is kind of in line with 8% in 3Q '23 and 3Q '22, very good balance of growth across international and in the U.S., but I'll double-click a little bit on the U.S. performed very well, 6% on top of 6% in Q3. We saw very good growth from MMA and Vector. And to Elyse's question, we did see double-digit growth in the capital markets and MMA products. Construction & Aviation performed well and globally, very strong growth in our benefits business as well. So overall, pleased with that good momentum and expect that to continue. Yes. Thank you, John I'll just start with a comment that overall, the composite rating index is up about 1.5x since 2012. The casualty book is up 6% in North America with the excess book up 21%. At the moment, we're not seeing dislocations in that the capacity that clients are requesting we can place, there are smaller limits that insurers have and we're doing jobs to think what we can do to place quota share programs for our clients to avoid compression of limits. And so we don't see anything too sinister in terms of supply for clients at this point. Certainly, there's been a movement to the E&S market and we're big players in that space. And that segment of the market has grown significantly. There's more agility and rate movement in those areas there. So we're well positioned to help them with that and we're continuing to work with them as our clients deal with some of the social inflation that we've talked about in the past as well. So lots of other services that we need to wrap around that to help our clients navigate this market."

            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning. Our momentum continued in the Q3, with solid underlying revenue growth, significant margin expansion and 4% growth in adjusted EPS or 11% excluding a large discrete tax benefit last year. Our consolidated revenue increased 6% to $5.7 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Operating income was $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion up 12%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 22.4%. GAAP EPS was $1.51 adjusted EPS was $1.63. For the first nine months, underlying revenue growth was 7%, adjusted operating income grew 12% to $4.9 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 28% and adjusted EPS increased 10% to $6.93. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, third quarter revenue was $3.5 billion, up 8% from a year ago or 6% on an underlying basis. This result marks the 15th consecutive quarter of 6% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. Note that fiduciary income was $138 million in the quarter and looking ahead to the Q4, we expect to see this amount decline by approximately $30 million reflecting recent rate cuts and a seasonal drop in fiduciary assets. Operating income in RIS increased 15% to $733 million. Adjusted operating income increased 16% to $775 million and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points to 24.7%. For the first nine months, revenue in RIS was $11.7 billion underlying growth of 8%. Adjusted operating income increased 12% to $3.7 billion and margin increased 100 basis points to 33.6%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 9% from a year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 8% growth in the Q3 of last year. Growth in the Q3 was broad based and reflected solid retention and new business growth. In U.S. and Canada, underlying growth was 6% for the quarter led by strong growth in MMA and in Victor, our MGA business. In international, underlying growth was 7% and comes on top of 10% in the Q3 of last year. Latin America was up 8%, EMEA was up 7% and Asia Pacific was up 5%. First nine months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $9.2 billion with underlying growth of 7%. U.S. and Canada grew 7% and international was up 7%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $381 million in the quarter, up 6% or 7% on an underlying basis, driven by strong growth in international including global specialties. For the first nine months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $2.2 billion of revenue and 8% underlying growth. In the consulting segment third quarter revenue was $2.3 billion, up 3% from a year ago or 4% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $462 million and adjusted operating income was $478 million, up 7%. Our adjusted operating margin in consulting was 21.7% in the third quarter, an increase of 90 basis points. The first nine months consulting revenue was $6.7 billion with underlying growth of 5%. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $1.3 billion and our adjusted operating margin increased 60 basis points to 20.7%. Mercer's revenue was $1.5 billion in the quarter, up 5% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's 14th consecutive quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth. Health underlying growth remains strong at 8% and reflected growth across all regions. Career grew 5%, where we saw strong growth in rewards and talent strategy. Wealth grew 4% driven by continued demand and defined benefits consulting and growth and investment management. Our assets under management at the end of the third quarter rose to $548 billion, up significantly from the third quarter of last year and up 11% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was driven by the impact of capital markets, our transaction with Vanguard and positive net flows. For the first nine months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $4.3 billion with 6% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $810 million, up 1% on an underlying basis. This reflects a tough comparison to 12% growth in the third quarter of last year and softness in certain geographies. We currently see this trend extending into the fourth quarter. The first nine months of the year revenue at Oliver Wyman was $2.4 billion, an increase of 5% on an underlying basis. Foreign exchange had very little impact on earnings in the third quarter, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels we also expect minimal FX impact in the fourth quarter. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $78 million. These included $54 million of restructuring costs mostly related to the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as some transaction related charges. Our other net benefit credit was $68 million in the quarter. For the full year 2024 we expect our other net benefit credit will be about $270 million. Interest expense in the third quarter was $154 million, up from $145 million in the third quarter of 2023, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $151 million of interest expense in the fourth quarter, excluding any amounts related to the McGriff transaction. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.7% compared with 20.5% in the third quarter of last year. Our tax rate last year included the release of evaluation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets. Excluding discrete items our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we expect an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 26.5% for 2024. Turning to our McGriff transaction. McGriff is a terrific company with excellent leadership, a culture similar to MMA's, a diversified business mix, presence in faster growing U.S. markets and a strong track record of performance. We will be paying $7.75 billion in cash consideration, funded by a combination of cash on hand and new debt and we expect to close by year end subject to regulatory approval. As part of the transaction, we expect to assume a deferred tax asset valued at approximately $500 million. As we've noted in the past, we maintain considerable balance sheet flexibility to position us for this type of opportunity. We've secured a committed bridge loan facility for the full amount of the purchase price and currently plan to replace these commitments with permanent financing in the Q4 as we get closer to closing. Based on our outlook today, we expect to raise $7.25 billion in new debt to fund the transaction. We value our high quality ratings and we were pleased that all three rating agencies recently affirmed our current ratings with no changes in outlook. The financial and capital management plan contemplated in the transaction is not only consistent with maintaining our current ratings, but we also expect to have meaningful flexibility for capital deployment next year. Although initially our leverage ratios will increase, the substantial cash flow we expect to generate as well as increased debt capacity through earnings growth will enable us to bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels necessary to maintain a strong ratings profile. As a result, while we intend to pause share repurchases in the fourth quarter, as we think about capital management into next year, we expect we will maintain our balanced approach that includes increasing our dividend and reducing our share count each year as well as continuing to fund high quality acquisitions. We will obviously have more guidance around our outlook for capital deployment in 2025 on our Q4 earnings call early next year. As John noted, we expect the transaction will be modestly accretive to adjusted EPS excluding amortization in year one becoming more meaningfully accretive in year two and beyond. This transaction is a great reflection of several elements of our capital management strategy, maintaining flexibility to take advantage of opportunities, a bias to reinvest capital for growth and delivering in the near-term, while challenging ourselves to invest to sustain growth into the future. Earnings capital management and our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total debt of $12.8 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the first of 2025, when $500 million of senior notes mature. We currently expect to deploy approximately $4.2 billion of capital in 2024 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases excluding the McGriff transaction. Our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $1.8 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.1 billion and included $404 million for dividends, $435 million for acquisitions and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first nine months, uses of cash totaled $3.3 billion included $1.1 billion for dividends, $1.3 billion for acquisitions and $900 million for share repurchases. I want to spend a minute on our plans to change how we report adjusted EPS. Starting next year, we will exclude the impact of acquisition related amortization from adjusted EPS. We will also exclude the other net benefit credit, another non-cash item. These changes will improve the comparability of our results and give investors a better sense of our core earnings power. They will also conform our adjusted EPS reporting with how we report adjusted operating margins. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and the current environment remains supportive of growth. Overall, we are well positioned for another great year in 2024. Based on our outlook today for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John. Yes, just I'll repeat that John. We -- free cash flow is something that is volatile quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. So best looked at over long stretches of time. Our track record in free cash flow growth, as we've noted before has been terrific. So we're a double-digit free cash flow growth for a decade plus. And that's what you'd expect for a company that's grown its EPS double-digits given our high cash generation capital type model. There's no story in the results year-to-date. So free cash flow is down. Year-to-date was up 28% last year. It was actually up in the third quarter. So what you're seeing year-to-date is just a number of factors that caused this period-to-period volatility. So we had higher variable compensation payouts in the first quarter because of our strong results last year. Receivables are up because of growth and it's just a little bit of business mix and timing. And there's just a handful of one-timers in last year's period, this period that affect the year-over-year comparison. So overall, we have an outlook for continued strong growth in earnings, and therefore, our free cash flow growth into the future should be strong as well. Yes, sure. Let me repeat what I said. We did have a lot in the script this quarter. So we just wanted to flag that as we look into the fourth quarter, we typically see, especially in Guy Carpenter, just given the seasonality of their revenue with so much activity in the first half, we do see fiduciary balances that tend to fall off in the fourth quarter. So we do expect fiduciary income to be $30 million or so lower in the fourth quarter from the level we saw in the third quarter. And it's a combination of the rate cuts that have happened and the impact that they will have as well as the seasonal drop in fiduciary balances. We look out to 2025, it's really going to depend on what rate actions happen from here. What happens in the balance of this year, what happens since the next year. And so we're going to stay away from speculating there, but just to repeat some of the things we've said in the past. The math is pretty straightforward. So we've got roughly $11.5 billion of balances on average these days. And so you can use that as a basis to try to do some sensitivity analysis around what that could mean to fiduciary income. There would be some offsets. There are -- there is some interplay with some of our variable compensation programs. We obviously would pay less in terms of interest on short-term debt. But we'll just have to wait and see what happens with further cuts as we look into next year."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. Second quarter 2024 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nJohn Doyle: Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second-quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Pat Tomlinson of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Before I get into our results, I'd like to comment on the attempted assassination of former US President, Donald Trump, this past weekend. We're thankful that he is safe and our hearts go out to the victims and their loved ones. Violence has no place in our politics or our society. We condemn it and affirm our commitment to civil discussion, debate, and resolution. Our political process and democracy depend on all candidates having the ability to safely convey their visions for our country. We believe that each of us can help shape peaceful public discourse and advocate for a culture of respect and unity. Now, turning to the second quarter, Marsh McLennan delivered strong results across our businesses and geographies. We generated 6% underlying revenue growth on top of 11% in the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong execution in both RIS and Consulting. We grew adjusted operating income a 11% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points and adjusted EPS grew 10%. We also announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.815 and completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter. These results highlight our consistent focus on delivering in the near term while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We're benefiting from organic investments we've made in our talent and capabilities, and we also continue to make high-quality acquisitions that build on the scale and breadth of our business. In the second quarter, we announced several significant transactions. Mercer announced an agreement to acquire Cardano, a long-term savings specialist in the UK and Netherlands. With approximately $66 billion in AUM, Cardano operates the third-largest UK master trust platform and serves more than 2 million customers across 27,000 employers. This transaction builds on our leading position in OCIO, enhances our DC offerings, and adds important trading capabilities. Oliver Wyman agreed to acquire Veritas Total Solutions, an advisor in commodity and energy markets. And Marsh McLennan Agency completed three acquisitions in the quarter. Fisher Brown Bottrell, one of the five largest bank affiliate agencies in the United States. Specializing in commercial P&C insurance and employee benefits, FBB expands our presence across the Southeast. AC Risk Management builds on our scale in commercial P&C in the Northeast and Perkins Insurance Agencies adds to our commercial P&C business in Texas. Last week, MMA also announced the acquisition of Horton, a Top 100 broker with over $100 million in revenue, operating primarily in the Midwest. And we recently announced the acquisitions of AmeriStar, a commercial P&C high-net-worth agency based in Minnesota, and Hudson Shore, a public sector employee benefits agency in New Jersey. These acquisitions are great examples of our ability to attract the very best insurance agencies to our company. And along with high rates of sustained underlying growth, they've helped to make MMA a $3.5 billion annual revenue business. We also continue to help our clients thrive by investing in innovation. Drawing on our expertise, perspective, data and insights, we are creating new solutions for a complex environment. For example, Marsh continues to evolve Blue[i], a digital suite of solutions for insurance strategy decisions that uses our data and analytics to generate insights for clients. This quarter, we added Blue[i] Risk Appetite Analytics to help clients define the amount and type of risk they're willing to retain. With customizable calculations, our insights help clients navigate a challenging landscape with greater confidence. Guy Carpenter launched CatStop+, a new solution to address the volatility of cyber risk using GC's proprietary analytics. CatStop+ offers clients protection against Cyber CAT losses. Mercer launched SelectRx, a technology solution in the US that creates competition amongst pharmacies for high-cost specialty medications. Leveraging Free Market Health's cloud-based platform, SelectRx lowers costs for employers and delivers savings to employees by directing prescriptions to a curated network of specialty pharmacies. And Oliver Wyman is helping our clients innovate in their own businesses with the launch of Quotient, which combines our expertise in AI implementation, deployment, and strategic advisory with our deep industry knowledge. Quotient moves clients beyond the hype surrounding AI to deliver real value and meaningful outcomes. Our approach to balancing near-term performance with investment and innovation delivers significant value to our clients. It also enables us to sustain growth over the long term and drive consistent exceptional performance for shareholders. Shifting to the macro picture, we continue to see significant opportunity to help clients navigate the complexity they're facing today. Beyond the shocking assassination attempt in the US, the geopolitical backdrop is unsettled with ongoing wars and areas of tension across the globe. Uncertainty also remains around the frequency of extreme weather, escalating cyber-attacks, and key variables in the economic outlook, like the persistence of inflation and the timing of changes to central bank policy. Despite this uncertainty, the environment remains supportive of growth in our business. In general, we see continued economic growth in most of our major markets. The cost of risk in healthcare continues to rise and labor markets remain tight. And the consensus probability of a near-term recession for major economies continues to decrease. We have performed well across economic cycles due to the resilience of our business, sustained demand for our advice and solutions, and consistent execution for our clients. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index was flat overall in the second quarter versus a 1% increase in the first quarter. Generally, rates in the US, Europe, and Latin America continued to increase in the low to mid-single-digits, while the UK, Asia, and Pacific saw low to mid-single-digit decreases. Global property rates were flat versus up 3% in the first quarter. Casualty increased in the low-single digits with US excess casualty up 10% in the quarter, while workers' compensation decreased low single-digits. Financial and professional liability rates and cyber pricing were down 5% and 6%, respectively. Midyear reinsurance renewals reflected increased demand for property cat with easing rates after significant increases in 2023. The majority of property placements were completed at renewal with adequate capacity. The global property cat reinsurance rates were generally flat to down mid-single-digits with greater decreases for upper layers on accounts without losses. The cat bond market had the most active quarter on record with over 30 new bonds issued involving approximately $8 billion of limit. Casualty programs faced continued underwriting scrutiny, but there was adequate capacity in the market. Excess of loss programs with US exposure saw upward pricing pressure, while quota share ceding commissions were flat to down slightly. As always, we are helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now, let me turn to our second-quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.41, which is up 10% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 6%. Underlying revenue grew 7% in RIS and 4% in Consulting. Marsh was up 7%, Guy Carpenter 11%, Mercer 5%, and Oliver Wyman grew 3%. Overall, the second quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 11% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points year-over-year. Turning to our outlook, we are well-positioned for another great year in 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, meaningful uncertainty remains and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. Overall, I'm proud of our second-quarter performance, which demonstrates continued execution on key initiatives and momentum across our business. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination, and the value they deliver to our clients, shareholders, and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our second-quarter results were strong with solid underlying growth, significant margin expansion, and 10% growth in adjusted EPS. Our consolidated revenue increased 6% to $6.2 billion with underlying growth of 6%. Operating income was $1.6 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.7 billion, up 11%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 29%. GAAP EPS was $2.27 and adjusted EPS was $2.41. For the first six months of 2024, underlying revenue growth was 8%, our adjusted operating income grew 11% to $3.7 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points and our adjusted EPS increased 12% to $5.30. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, second-quarter revenue was $4 billion, up 8% from a year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This result marks the 14th consecutive quarter of 7% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. RIS operating income was $1.3 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was also $1.3 billion, up 12% over last year and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 35.3%. For the first six months of the year, revenue in RIS was $8.3 billion with underlying growth of 8%, adjusted operating income increased 12% to $2.9 billion and our margin increased 90 basis points to 37.3%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $3.3 billion, up 8% from a year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This strong growth came on top of 10% growth in the second quarter of last year. Growth in the second quarter reflected strong new business and solid renewals. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 6% for the quarter. International underlying growth was 7%. EMEA was up 7%, Asia-Pacific grew 7%, and Latin America was up 8%. For the first six months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $6.3 billion with underlying growth of 7%. US and Canada grew 7% and international was up 8%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $632 million in the quarter, up 10% or 11% on an underlying basis. This terrific result came on top of 11% growth last year and was driven by double-digit growth across most geographies and specialties. For the first six months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.8 billion of revenue and 9% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, up 2% from a year ago or 4% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $410 million and adjusted operating income was $426 million, up 6%. Our adjusted operating margin in Consulting was 19.8% in the second quarter, an increase of 60 basis points. For the first six months of 2024, Consulting revenue was $4.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 6%. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $870 million and our margin increased 50 basis points to 20.3%. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, flat compared to a year ago, but up 5% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's 13th straight quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth and continues the best run of growth in 15 years. Wealth grew 3%, driven by growth in both Investment Management and DB Consulting. Our assets under management were $492 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 1% sequentially and up 25% compared to the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transaction with Vanguard, impact of capital markets, and positive net flows. Health underlying growth remained strong at 9% and reflected growth across all regions. Career revenue increased 2%, continuing the trend of modest growth following a two-year stretch of strong growth in demand. For the first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.8 billion with 6% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $837 million, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 11% growth a year ago. For the first six months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.6 billion, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis, up from 6% growth in the first half of last year. Foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.02 headwind in the third quarter and $0.02 in the fourth quarter. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $73 million. These included $44 million of restructuring costs, mostly related to the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as some transaction-related expenses. Our other net benefit credit was $66 million in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect our other net benefit credit will be approximately $265 million. Interest expense in the second quarter was $156 million, up from $146 million in the second quarter last year, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $154 million of interest expense in the third quarter and approximately $620 million for the full year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 26.2% compared with 24.2% in the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25.5% and 26.5% for 2024. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total debt of $13.5 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the first quarter of 2025 when $500 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital in 2024 across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. Last week, we announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend, making this our 15th consecutive year of dividend growth. This comes on top of a 20% increase a year ago and reflects our strong earnings growth and confidence in our outlook. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1.7 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.2 billion and included $352 million for dividends, $500 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first six months, uses of cash totaled $2.2 billion and included $706 million for dividends, $847 million for acquisitions, and $600 million for share repurchases. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and the current environment remains supportive of growth. Overall, our excellent first half leaves us well-positioned for another great year in 2024. Based on our outlook today, for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Thanks. Good morning. I just had a question on the underlying revenue growth outlook of mid-single-digit or greater. You guys just did 8% in the first half of underlying revenue growth, but are increasing the range to high single-digit. Could you just help me think through the puts and takes in terms of why you guys aren't increasing the range?\nJohn Doyle: Good morning, David. Sure. So yeah, let me first of all, just say, I was pleased with our growth in the quarter. It was on top of a very big quarter a year ago at 11%. Marsh had good solid growth by region and practice on top of a tough comp. Guy Carpenter had an excellent quarter. Market improvements led to increased demand after a pretty volatile reinsurance market in 2023. Mercer again had another solid quarter of growth, as Mark noted in his comments, best growth -- stretch of growth in a long period of time. Health remains very strong. Wealth growth was solid and we actually saw an uptick in career growth from the first quarter. And Oliver Wyman had a very tough comp, but had good growth -- has had good growth year-to-date. And as we pointed out in the past, we'll have more quarter-to-quarter volatility than our other businesses. What I would say is broadly speaking, the macros continue to be supportive of growth. It's a risky environment we're all operating in, but GDP, inflation, labor markets, the cost -- rising cost of risk, rising cost of healthcare, all supportive. And I feel very, very -- I feel like we're very well-positioned. We have the best talent in the markets that we compete in. And so, we're positive on our outlook for the second half, that again remains a good market for us. And so we feel good about where we are.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks, John. And then, Mark, I think you mentioned on last quarter's call that you guys are expecting greater margin expansion in the second half than in the first half. Is that still the case?\nJohn Doyle: You want to go ahead, Mark?\nMark McGivney: Yeah. We're really happy with 130 basis points and it validated the statements we made about the first-quarter margin expansion facing headwinds from several items. So we were good -- we're glad to see the acceleration and we're on track for solid margin expansion for the year.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, David. Andrew, next question.\nOperator: One moment please for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Hey, good morning. So first, John, just following up on your comments on Oliver Wyman. The growth this quarter slowed versus what it's been in the last few quarters. How much of that is a function of just tough comps and normal volatility in the business versus maybe a slowdown in the pipeline?\nJohn Doyle: Yeah, Jimmy, thanks for the question you know and I'll hand it to Nick here. But was it -- I think it's sum of both, right? But it's a -- it was a tough comp for sure, but we feel very good about the year-to-growth -- growth -- year-to-date growth. Excuse me. Nick, you want to add a little bit more depth?\nNick Studer: Yeah. I think John is right, Jimmy, it's a little bit of both, but in the same way that I noted last quarter that our 13% was against a weak 0% comp, this 3% is against a tougher 11%. That 8% year-to-date, I think is bang in that zone of mid to high-single-digit growth we expect to average through the cycle. And as you know, our quarters are always somewhat volatile. Mark kindly noted in his comments that the first half actually accelerated versus the first half last year. To give you a little bit of color on where we are seeing higher growth, regionally, both Asia and our India, Middle-East, and Africa regions have continued on strong growth. From an industry perspective, our communications, media, and technology practice has been our fastest-growing year-to-date, but our very strong banking and insurance practices also in positive territory as is our public sector practice. And we have a wide array of capabilities. And our economic research business, NERA, growing strongly. Our market-leading finance and risk practice, particularly in financial services, our pricing team. And importantly, our people and organizational performance practice, which really works across our industries to help on big client transformative moments. But the market is a little bit uncertain. While the economy seems to be better, it's still a pressured environment for discretionary spending, some uncertainties as John and Mark have highlighted. And we do see -- we're sort of working through some pricing pressure due to excess capacity as some of our competitors work through some of their headcount actions.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Nick. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up?\nJimmy Bhullar: Yeah, just on -- and maybe it's for Mark on fiduciary investment income. It was -- it's been sort of flattish on a sequential basis. So should we assume given where rates are that going forward, it's going to grow just with growth in the business or was the sequential flat results in 2Q more of a function of seasonality and balances or other factors?\nJohn Doyle: Mark?\nMark McGivney: Jimmy, there is -- there is seasonality in balances as we've talked about in the past. But I think the biggest driver, I think, from here is just going to be the outlook for rates. As we've talked about and you saw on our balance sheet in the quarter, we've got about $11.5 billion of fiduciary balances and so I think just where we go from here is just going to be what the central banks do with short-term interest rates. And just as you're modeling going forward, keep in mind that our balances do reflect the revenue mix of our business. So it's not just US rates, obviously that drive -- we've got balances because of the distributed nature of business all over the world. So yeah, so as I said, the outlook really is going to be mostly a function of what the rate picture looks like.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Jimmy. Andrew, next question?\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, within RIS, can you give us a sense of how much of the expenses helped your margins in the quarter?\nJohn Doyle: Expense saves, can you give me a [indiscernible] Okay. Okay. Sure. Sure. Thanks, Elyse. Mark?\nMark McGivney: Yeah. Elyse, we're definitely seeing the benefit of it. We've stayed away from quantifying specifically how much is going to drop quarter-to-quarter. But you just even see the trend in expense growth quarter-to-quarter that was definitely a factor. Our strong growth and the benefit of savings contributed to that 130 basis points of margin expansion. So we're -- as I said, we haven't quantified the amount that we're seeing each quarter, but we are on track for the level of savings that we talked about and we're seeing the benefit of it.\nJohn Doyle: Do you have a follow-up, Elyse?\nElyse Greenspan: Yeah. And then my second question within Marsh, could you just give us a sense of what you're seeing, some more color in both the US and internationally within organic growth, both for the Q2 and then how you think about the outlook in the back half of the year? And are US or internationally, are you guys more indexed to property in one versus the other?\nJohn Doyle: Yeah. I mean the markets are quite dynamic, right? And so, I would just caution you a little bit on pricing, right? I think Guy Carpenter is a good indication of that, right? So we saw a better market lead to increased demand. But as I mentioned earlier, it was a good solid growth by region and by practice, again in the second quarter and on top of a tough comp. But Martin, maybe you could share a little bit more color on growth international versus US and the demand you're seeing.\nMartin South: Sure. So just to restate 7% in the quarter, which is on top of 10% for the second quarter of '23. Quite balanced growth, the international at 7% and the US at 6% -- US and Canada at 6%. Our US business MMA and Victor continued to perform very well in the US. Canada had a weaker quarter, some macros there affected that, that pulled down a little bit. But across the international region, international was a 7% on top of 10% in '23. Asia-Pacific accelerated from 7% on top of 6% in '23, and Latin-America did 8% on top of 17% in the second quarter of '23 and EMEA did 7% on top of 11% in '23. The performance was driven really by very strong performance internationally in the benefits business. Construction, energy, and power all came off strong double-digit growth as well, repeating what happened last year. And we're beginning to see some revitalization in the US capital markets, which has been a headwind for new business growth going back to '21. Renewal base growth was strong and solid, as was new business in both US and Canada and international. And our lost business improved slightly as we continue to build stickier relationships with clients as we engage more deeply, and we aspire to be the risk advisor of the future, talking to them well beyond conventional risk. We feel very well-positioned. Overall, the mix of premium in the US will be more weighted to casualty in its broad terms and probably more balanced in international for property-casualty to answer your -- in terms of property to answer your question.\nJohn Doyle: Yeah, reflection of the liability environment in the US for sure. Thank you, Elyse, and thanks, Martin. Andrew, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets.\nScott Heleniak: Yeah, good morning. Just a quick question. Given the M&A pace has been pretty strong over the past few quarters and certainly for the year, just wondering if we should assume kind of a deceleration in the run-rate for share backs -- share buybacks in the second half versus the first half? Just how you're thinking about that and how is your M&A tracking versus kind of what you thought going into the year?\nJohn Doyle: Yeah. Sure, Scott. Thanks for the question. No change to our philosophy. We continue to take a balanced approach to capital management. We have about $4.5 billion to deploy during the course of the year. Broadly speaking, we favor attractive investments in our business, whether it's organic or inorganic over buybacks, but we're not going to let cash build up on the balance sheet either. And as I noted earlier, we increased our dividend beginning in this quarter. I mean, we aspire to raise our dividend every year. We bought back $300 million in the -- of shares in the second quarter. We're pleased with what we've seen in the -- in the M&A market. As I said, it was an active quarter. I mean, we announced a couple of deals really at the start here of the second quarter just after the 1st of July. And so, we're excited about those deals and we'll continue to be active in the market. But ultimately, the amount of share repurchase will depend on what's obviously a volatile M&A. You never know what the ultimate outcome will be in M&A but we're seeing some good opportunities to invest in our business. Do you have a follow-up?\nScott Heleniak: Yeah. Just one quick one, too. Just generally on Mercer, the Health organic growth really strong again, and 9% has been strong for quite a while. And Career and Wealth, I guess, is a little bit slower compared to Health, but just wondering if you can just kind of flesh out what you're seeing there, the strength in Health versus the other areas, if there's anything kind of holding those -- back those areas besides just the kind of difficult comps?\nJohn Doyle: Yeah. Thanks, Scott, and I'll ask Pat to comment in a second. But I mentioned rising healthcare costs in my opening remarks. It's a big pressure point for our clients in this economy. And so -- and particularly given the tight labor markets in most major economies around the world. So -- it's really a terrific value we're delivering to our clients in a very tough marketplace there. Wealth is going to have some volatility as well Career quarter-to-quarter, but Pat, maybe you could talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the marketplace.\nPat Tomlinson: Sure. Thanks, and thanks so much for the question. First off, we're pleased with the Q2 underlying growth of 5%. As Mark highlighted, our 13th consecutive quarter with 5% or more growth and that all the practices are contributing to growth. Certainly, health has been contributing at a higher rate. Quickly to kind of go through the practices and what we're seeing. Health, as you highlighted, had that impressive quarter with 9% growth. The strong performance was broad-based, right? So there was double-digit growth across most regions. It comes predominantly from investments in hiring new talent, investments in thought leadership, including our Health on Demand survey, new digital tools, and a focus on client segmentation that's really designed to match our clients' healthcare needs with our innovative and tailored solutions. We benefited from renewal and some new business growth, some insurer revenue, and has been highlighted a couple of times in the call, medical cost inflation, certainly. We continue to see strong demand for digital solutions and innovative benefits underscoring really the value of -- and the breadth of advice and solutions we bring to clients. Little less growth in Wealth and Career. So let me quickly go through them. Wealth, we grew the 3% in Q2. That was balanced between DD&A and IMS, right? So DB plans funding status continue to benefit from elevated interest rates. It's driving an increase in project work, predominantly revolving around risk transfers as well as certain regulatory requirements that are out in some of the jurisdictions around the world. We head in the volatile capital markets, it's been driving some strong demand for actuarial and the investment solutions. John had highlighted in OCIO we did benefit from the transaction with Vanguard. We had some net new inflows and capital markets also provided a revenue lift. It's important to note that on IMS, from a business perspective, it's a portfolio of solutions, right, that includes some advisory work and some DC administration in addition to OCIO. So a lot of times, it's typically looked at as OCIO. And only our OCIO business is directly impacted by AUM. So as we've seen a market run-up, really, we only have a subset of that business that's directly impacted by AUM. And our AUM is a diversified portfolio where equities only make up about half of our exposure, right, because we have a lot of clients that have heavy fixed income exposure. So while the markets can drive some volatility for us, the impact of equity markets is a bit more muted in IMS growth. And then on Career, which had the most modest growth of 2%, which was up sequentially over quarter, it is following a long period of growth after the pandemic. We saw good growth momentum from a couple of our practices, talent and transformation. Rewards was a bit more muted. And I think that's predominantly reflecting the impact of lower wage inflation and reduced employee turnover, which is driving some slightly lower demand for our clients at rewards projects. But I think it's also important to note here that while the growth rates fell down, has been flat even over the last couple of quarters, it's been a bit more modest. The overall size of our Career practice is nearly 20% larger than it was pre-pandemic. So that's -- so we feel very strong about that that we've been able to maintain those levels in a predominantly project-based business. So, overall, I think the conditions have us very positive about the outlook for Mercer.\nJohn Doyle: Terrific. Thank you, Pat. Scott, thank you for your questions. Andrew, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Great. Good morning. Focusing on the property cat's key pricing environment, I guess, competitive environment. John, I believe you said that Marsh index [deceled] (ph) again to zero from one. Just curious, given Marsh does have a lot more small to mid-account business now too, it feels like there's like two different tales, two different stories going on between the large account and the SMid accounts. I don't know if you'd agree with that. And if yes, any color you could offer kind of why we're seeing two different trends there on pricing?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, sure. Sure, Mike. Thanks. Thanks for the question. I'll share some high-level thoughts, and then maybe I'll ask both Martin and Dean to talk about some market observations. I would note, Mike, just right out of the gate here that typically, larger account pricing has more volatility attached to it. If you look back on historical cycles, that's been the case. Mid-market pricing has historically been more stable or more consistent, I guess, and have less volatility from cycle to cycle. And our index is weighted towards large accounts to be clear, where we have the best data. But insurance and reinsurance markets continue to settle in the quarter after what's been many years of increases. It's not just middle versus large, it's a collection of markets. And while as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, cyber and FinPro, maybe the best example, prices continue to moderate. Some segments of the market are showing some -- what might be early signs of stress. US Excess Casualty, for example, prices were up 10%, and loss cost inflation there remains quite challenging. But overall, right now, market is providing an opportunity for our clients to revisit some decisions they've made about financing risk and that tighter market conditions led them to make uncertain decisions. So it's a welcome moment for many of our clients to revisit some of those decisions. And Guy Carpenter, as I mentioned earlier, it led to greater demand in the second quarter as evidenced by our strong growth. But Martin, maybe you could share a little bit more color on what we're seeing in the pricing market?\nMartin South: Sure. Just reminding ourselves, 26 quarters of rate increases, which just turned flat now. And as John noted, the -- our index is geared much more towards the larger account segment of our business. And obviously, the mid-market business in the smaller end has less volatility in pricing. But just by line of business, casualty in the US is up 3%, which, as John said, is really dominated by the 10% increase in the umbrella book, which we talked about in earlier calls about the volatility in claims inflation there. Property is flat in most regions, except for the Middle East and India, where we're still seeing some increases in property, maybe as a result of some of the activity in the Middle East in this past quarter. Core FinPro contracting at 5%, with rate decline pretty much across the world, and cyber contracting 6% which is mostly consistent with what we saw in Q1. The pricing trends consistent with recent quarters, we're seeing some slight increases in geographies, but rate contraction is more than normal. And so those are the key issues really that I would comment on now. But of course, as far as our business is concerned, we -- a lot of our business is fee-based or controlled commission basis, and exposure growth has been significant over the last few years as well, which is a counterweight to that.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Martin. Dean, maybe you can just quickly cover the reinsurance market.\nDean Klisura: Yeah, thanks, John. And, Mike, just a couple of headlines about the property cat reinsurance market, which certainly is connected to the underlying property market that Martin is describing. As John noted, it's a much more predictable and smooth market than we experienced last year in the 2023 hard market for property cat. Placements have been completed on time. There's been adequate capacity in the marketplace for our clients. There's an increased reinsurer appetite in the market, and we know why, right? They're driving 20% plus ROEs in this market given the rate increases of last year and the higher attachment points our clients have been forced to absorb with greater volatility. We're seeing very strong ILS activity in the market. John noted, record cat bond issuance in the quarter, 34 discrete cat bonds, some $8 billion of limit in the quarter. And I think that we're seeing moderating cat rates in the market compared to 2023. But I would say that if you look at year-over-year premium spend for property cat and our rate online index, it's still up 1% year-over-year. It has not gone negative in the market. And really, as John noted, Mike, I think the headline, the key takeaway is significant increased client demand for additional property cat limit. In the first half of the year, two-thirds of our US clients bought more property cat coverage across an additional $10 billion of limit, which is truly significant in the marketplace. We're also seeing clients reinsure by more retrocession coverage with improved pricing, market dynamics, improved appetite by sellers, both rated and ILS vehicles in the market. And I think the last headline for you is there's caution in the property market. There's $50 billion-plus of insured losses in the first half of the year. When you think about severe convective storms in the US and Japan, Taiwanese earthquake, floods in Germany, the UAE, Baltimore bridge collapse, Hurricane Beryl, I mean we could be on track for another $100 billion a year of insured losses. So there's caution in the market around property and property debt.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Dean. So, Mike, not a big shift from the first quarter, but a modest evolving market more in favor of buyers. And so that obviously factors into the advice we give to our clients and help them navigate what's a world where, again, the cost of risk continues to escalate. Do you have a follow-up?\nMichael Zaremski: Yeah. Very quick follow-up. Thank you. Just not to nitpick, but if I'm just looking at total revenue growth and I guess, ultimately, EBITDA adjusted, I think divestitures and maybe a little FX is what, I think, us and maybe the consensus was off on a little bit. Just want to make sure there's nothing missing, it's still a net acquirer in terms of M&A, but is there chunky divestitures? Is there anything I should be thinking about in the very near term that -- in terms of that impact?\nJohn Doyle: No, no. I mean at Mercer, we sold two admin businesses, one in the US, one in the UK to Aptia. And the reason we sold them is they're relatively low-growth and lower-margin businesses. And again on a relative basis, they were capital-intensive. And so we think they have a better owner now and so we feel good about that decision. Thank you, Mike. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James.\nGregory Peters: Well, good morning. I guess I'd like to just go back to some comments you made in your prepared remarks. You mentioned Blue[i]. I was wondering if you could provide some more specific data around that. It's a data analytics business, just provide some scope of how big it is inside the business because you called it out in your call.\nJohn Doyle: Yeah, it's not a business. It's part of really how we advise our clients at Marsh. And so Blue[i] is kind the brand, if you will, for our suite of analytics. And Martin, maybe you could just share some insight on the range of types of tools that we use that help our clients think about how they manage and finance risk.\nMartin South: Sure. So as you said, John, this is a suite of analytics tools that we use to help our clients across different product lines assess what risks to retain, what risk they could transfer, the economic cost of that. We pay them across multiple lines to give them exposure and total cost of risk scenarios. We help them analyze claims and the analytics tools in that are able to help our clients who self-insure a lot of losses to identify which losses they need to get at early and how to settled those. So it's a range of real-time analytics built really, and it's one of the unique things about our business is that we have an enormous lake of data, and we think that's one of the big moats that we have to support our business. And some of these analytics tools that we use, we call them generically Blue[i]. We deploy on clients that actually don\u2019t even buy insurance. They tend to be some of our biggest clients in the US. So we'll continue to invest in that. And as we announced in the call last year, we added to that with supply chain capability and -- so it's the way clients expect to be engaged, and that's the tool that we use.\nJohn Doyle: So we use these tools to help -- and it's really mostly upfront, but to help them understand -- our clients understand those risks, strategies to manage and mitigate those risks. We spend most of our time on these calls for good reasons, talking about the financing of risk when we go to market, but it's an important part of our value proposition. It's another example of where we can bring scale benefits to the market, given the unique data set that we have and the range of proprietary analytics we use. And while it operates under a different brand, the same will be said for the way we approach our clients in the market at Guy Carpenter. Do you have a follow-up, Greg?\nGregory Peters: I sure do. Thanks for the color on that. Just going through the operating cash flow and the free cash flow for the six months, down a little bit. It looks like it's changes in working capital. Wondering if you could just provide some additional color on the operating cash flow for the quarter and the year -- six-month basis?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Greg. Yeah, it's going to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. But Mark, maybe you can.\nMark McGivney: Yeah, Greg. Thanks. You will -- we always -- we'll always caution against focusing too much on a quarter's results, and that's certainly true when it comes to cash flows and free cash flow. They tend to be volatile, not only quarter to quarter, but year to year because of timing of balance sheet items. As you -- so when you look at the six months, we are seeing a decline of course, given the significant bonus payouts that we have in the first quarter, you have a little bit of a denominator -- small denominator issue. And so, you have to be cautious. But two big factors just in the first six months are the higher comp payouts that we had in the first quarter and then receivables are up because of the growth in the business. But we've got a, as you know, a long track record of double-digit growth in free cash flow that has stacked up well against our growth in earnings, and that's what you'd expect in a capital-light business like ours.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Mark, and thanks, Greg, for the questions. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. I just had a follow-up on an earlier question on margins. So I think last quarter, you had said that you expected the margin to accelerate, particularly in the second half of the year. Sounded like from the response this morning that maybe that's no longer the case. So I guess just to be very clear, if we look at the 100 basis points or so of margin expansion in the first half of this year, would you expect that to be better in the second half or not? And I guess the second part of the question, will be -- if there was a bit of a change, is it because the margin expansion in the second quarter was greater than you initially expected or are you all expecting some softening relative to your guidance for the second half of the year?\nJohn Doyle: No. We expect margin expansion in the second half to be better than the first half. Sorry, if we created any confusion earlier, but that's what we continue to expect. And maybe I can just share a little bit of color and just remind everybody, too, margins and outcome, right? This will be year 17 of -- 17th consecutive year of margin expansion, and so we feel terrific about that. But margin is an outcome of the way we run the business. We manage investments and costs within the revenue growth of the business. It's not going to happen in every business in every single quarter, but that\u2019s -- it's the way we approach our business. We're going to continue to make attractive investments to support medium to long-term growth. But we see opportunities. As I've mentioned in the past, we've got workflow and automation efforts inside of Marsh. Mercer and Guy Carpenter. We're testing AI at scale. So that value creation is not a meaningful 2024 or probably 2025 event. But as technologies emerge, we'll continue to challenge ourselves to get better. But again, we do expect second-half margin expansion to be better than first half. Do you have a follow-up?\nYaron Kinar: Thanks so much for the color and clarification. I asked a two-part question, so I'll turn it back to you.\nJohn Doyle: Got it. Thank you. Andrew, next question please.\nOperator: One moment please. And our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Good morning, all. I guess to start, can you talk about how you're advising both insurance and reinsurance clients to think about their exposure to casualty lines following the overturning of the Chevron doctrine?\nJohn Doyle: Well, I'm not sure I see a direct line between that particular case and the overall environment. But what I would say to you is that -- and what we've talked about on this call historically -- or I shouldn't say historically, but over the course of the last couple of years is just troubling signs of loss cost inflation, particularly here in the United States. And the amount of large or mega judgments and settlements is quite challenging. And so we spend a lot of time, and Martin talked briefly about the suite of analytics we use. It's inside of that suite of analytics, we help our clients think about a range of outcomes, what type of limits they should consider buying, how they might benchmark anonymously against others in their industry as an example. But that's -- those are all important inputs and ultimately, our clients make decisions and judgments and some have the ability to finance more risk or choose to finance more risk on their own. And others will look to finance risk on the balance sheets of insurance companies or in certain cases to capital markets as well. So I hope that's helpful, Meyer?\nMeyer Shields: It is. Thank you. It is very good big picture. This is more of a small-picture issue. But when we look at, let's say, the two-year stacked organic growth in Career, that grew dramatically from the first quarter, I guess, you had [12% plus 1% at 13% in this quarter 6% plus 2%, to 8%] (ph). Is your outlook for Career based on the items or the issue you identified earlier, is that slowing compared to maybe what you thought at the end of the first quarter?\nJohn Doyle: No, I don't think there's a real change from the first quarter. As Pat mentioned some of the dynamics, less active labor markets from a turnover point of view, lower comp [and ban] (ph) so it's a -- we didn't have expectations of higher growth in that business during the course of 2024, and we haven't seen anything through six months that changes that outlook.\nMeyer Shields: Fantastic. Thank you very much.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you. Andrew, time for maybe one more?\nOperator: Certainly. And our final question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRob Cox: Hey, thanks for fitting me in. John, I wanted to go back to something you said last quarter, which was that Marsh accesses most of its E&S market solutions directly today. I'm curious how that split between the percentage of premiums placed directly in E&S versus through a third-party wholesaler has trended over recent years and how you think that might trend going forward?\nJohn Doyle: Yeah. Again, I -- just to be clear, we're not looking to build a third-party wholesale business. We want to bring the best solutions to our clients. The E&S markets moved quite a bit over the course of the last several years. That's really a reflection of the high risk environment that I've talked about where insurers have, broadly speaking, more freedom to change rate, to get off risk, to change price -- or to change terms and conditions as well. And so just broadly speaking, we want to manage our clients' outcomes and experiences directly as possible and not outsource what's an important part of the value proposition. It's not to say that wholesalers don't do a nice job for us, they do and we'll continue to access them where it makes sense. But -- but we -- most of the -- majority of the wholesale premium, we actually access directly today or E&S markets, we do that directly today. But there's been more growth in intermediated wholesale premium over the course of the last couple of years. And so our efforts are to try to get as much access to market as we can. Do you have a follow-up, Robert?\nRob Cox: Yeah. Thank you. That's a great color. Yeah, second question was just on sort of the different economics Guy Carpenter gets from cat bonds versus traditional reinsurance placement. And if you could help us think about how much that record cat bond quarter contributed to organic growth?\nJohn Doyle: Yeah. The economics can be different, of course, and they're different from treaty to treaty as well. We work with our insurance company clients. As we talked about when the market was particularly tight last year, while commission is a factor and growing price was a factor in many respects, really what we do with our large insurance company clients is big wholesale relationships where effectively we work on, what amounts to a fee.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you. Go ahead, Andrew.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan for any closing remarks.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.",

            "name": "Pat Tomlinson",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, and thanks so much for the question. First off, we're pleased with the Q2 underlying growth of 5%. As Mark highlighted, our 13th consecutive quarter with 5% or more growth and that all the practices are contributing to growth. Certainly, health has been contributing at a higher rate. Quickly to kind of go through the practices and what we're seeing. Health, as you highlighted, had that impressive quarter with 9% growth. The strong performance was broad-based, right? So there was double-digit growth across most regions. It comes predominantly from investments in hiring new talent, investments in thought leadership, including our Health on Demand survey, new digital tools, and a focus on client segmentation that's really designed to match our clients' healthcare needs with our innovative and tailored solutions. We benefited from renewal and some new business growth, some insurer revenue, and has been highlighted a couple of times in the call, medical cost inflation, certainly. We continue to see strong demand for digital solutions and innovative benefits underscoring really the value of -- and the breadth of advice and solutions we bring to clients. Little less growth in Wealth and Career. So let me quickly go through them. Wealth, we grew the 3% in Q2. That was balanced between DD&A and IMS, right? So DB plans funding status continue to benefit from elevated interest rates. It's driving an increase in project work, predominantly revolving around risk transfers as well as certain regulatory requirements that are out in some of the jurisdictions around the world. We head in the volatile capital markets, it's been driving some strong demand for actuarial and the investment solutions. John had highlighted in OCIO we did benefit from the transaction with Vanguard. We had some net new inflows and capital markets also provided a revenue lift. It's important to note that on IMS, from a business perspective, it's a portfolio of solutions, right, that includes some advisory work and some DC administration in addition to OCIO. So a lot of times, it's typically looked at as OCIO. And only our OCIO business is directly impacted by AUM. So as we've seen a market run-up, really, we only have a subset of that business that's directly impacted by AUM. And our AUM is a diversified portfolio where equities only make up about half of our exposure, right, because we have a lot of clients that have heavy fixed income exposure. So while the markets can drive some volatility for us, the impact of equity markets is a bit more muted in IMS growth. And then on Career, which had the most modest growth of 2%, which was up sequentially over quarter, it is following a long period of growth after the pandemic. We saw good growth momentum from a couple of our practices, talent and transformation. Rewards was a bit more muted. And I think that's predominantly reflecting the impact of lower wage inflation and reduced employee turnover, which is driving some slightly lower demand for our clients at rewards projects. But I think it's also important to note here that while the growth rates fell down, has been flat even over the last couple of quarters, it's been a bit more modest. The overall size of our Career practice is nearly 20% larger than it was pre-pandemic. So that's -- so we feel very strong about that that we've been able to maintain those levels in a predominantly project-based business. So, overall, I think the conditions have us very positive about the outlook for Mercer."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "John Doyle",
            "content": "Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our second-quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO; and the CEOs of our businesses, Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Pat Tomlinson of Mercer; and Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman. Also with us this morning is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Before I get into our results, I'd like to comment on the attempted assassination of former US President, Donald Trump, this past weekend. We're thankful that he is safe and our hearts go out to the victims and their loved ones. Violence has no place in our politics or our society. We condemn it and affirm our commitment to civil discussion, debate, and resolution. Our political process and democracy depend on all candidates having the ability to safely convey their visions for our country. We believe that each of us can help shape peaceful public discourse and advocate for a culture of respect and unity. Now, turning to the second quarter, Marsh McLennan delivered strong results across our businesses and geographies. We generated 6% underlying revenue growth on top of 11% in the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong execution in both RIS and Consulting. We grew adjusted operating income a 11% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points and adjusted EPS grew 10%. We also announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.815 and completed $300 million of share repurchases during the quarter. These results highlight our consistent focus on delivering in the near term while investing for sustained growth over the long term. We're benefiting from organic investments we've made in our talent and capabilities, and we also continue to make high-quality acquisitions that build on the scale and breadth of our business. In the second quarter, we announced several significant transactions. Mercer announced an agreement to acquire Cardano, a long-term savings specialist in the UK and Netherlands. With approximately $66 billion in AUM, Cardano operates the third-largest UK master trust platform and serves more than 2 million customers across 27,000 employers. This transaction builds on our leading position in OCIO, enhances our DC offerings, and adds important trading capabilities. Oliver Wyman agreed to acquire Veritas Total Solutions, an advisor in commodity and energy markets. And Marsh McLennan Agency completed three acquisitions in the quarter. Fisher Brown Bottrell, one of the five largest bank affiliate agencies in the United States. Specializing in commercial P&C insurance and employee benefits, FBB expands our presence across the Southeast. AC Risk Management builds on our scale in commercial P&C in the Northeast and Perkins Insurance Agencies adds to our commercial P&C business in Texas. Last week, MMA also announced the acquisition of Horton, a Top 100 broker with over $100 million in revenue, operating primarily in the Midwest. And we recently announced the acquisitions of AmeriStar, a commercial P&C high-net-worth agency based in Minnesota, and Hudson Shore, a public sector employee benefits agency in New Jersey. These acquisitions are great examples of our ability to attract the very best insurance agencies to our company. And along with high rates of sustained underlying growth, they've helped to make MMA a $3.5 billion annual revenue business. We also continue to help our clients thrive by investing in innovation. Drawing on our expertise, perspective, data and insights, we are creating new solutions for a complex environment. For example, Marsh continues to evolve Blue[i], a digital suite of solutions for insurance strategy decisions that uses our data and analytics to generate insights for clients. This quarter, we added Blue[i] Risk Appetite Analytics to help clients define the amount and type of risk they're willing to retain. With customizable calculations, our insights help clients navigate a challenging landscape with greater confidence. Guy Carpenter launched CatStop+, a new solution to address the volatility of cyber risk using GC's proprietary analytics. CatStop+ offers clients protection against Cyber CAT losses. Mercer launched SelectRx, a technology solution in the US that creates competition amongst pharmacies for high-cost specialty medications. Leveraging Free Market Health's cloud-based platform, SelectRx lowers costs for employers and delivers savings to employees by directing prescriptions to a curated network of specialty pharmacies. And Oliver Wyman is helping our clients innovate in their own businesses with the launch of Quotient, which combines our expertise in AI implementation, deployment, and strategic advisory with our deep industry knowledge. Quotient moves clients beyond the hype surrounding AI to deliver real value and meaningful outcomes. Our approach to balancing near-term performance with investment and innovation delivers significant value to our clients. It also enables us to sustain growth over the long term and drive consistent exceptional performance for shareholders. Shifting to the macro picture, we continue to see significant opportunity to help clients navigate the complexity they're facing today. Beyond the shocking assassination attempt in the US, the geopolitical backdrop is unsettled with ongoing wars and areas of tension across the globe. Uncertainty also remains around the frequency of extreme weather, escalating cyber-attacks, and key variables in the economic outlook, like the persistence of inflation and the timing of changes to central bank policy. Despite this uncertainty, the environment remains supportive of growth in our business. In general, we see continued economic growth in most of our major markets. The cost of risk in healthcare continues to rise and labor markets remain tight. And the consensus probability of a near-term recession for major economies continues to decrease. We have performed well across economic cycles due to the resilience of our business, sustained demand for our advice and solutions, and consistent execution for our clients. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index was flat overall in the second quarter versus a 1% increase in the first quarter. Generally, rates in the US, Europe, and Latin America continued to increase in the low to mid-single-digits, while the UK, Asia, and Pacific saw low to mid-single-digit decreases. Global property rates were flat versus up 3% in the first quarter. Casualty increased in the low-single digits with US excess casualty up 10% in the quarter, while workers' compensation decreased low single-digits. Financial and professional liability rates and cyber pricing were down 5% and 6%, respectively. Midyear reinsurance renewals reflected increased demand for property cat with easing rates after significant increases in 2023. The majority of property placements were completed at renewal with adequate capacity. The global property cat reinsurance rates were generally flat to down mid-single-digits with greater decreases for upper layers on accounts without losses. The cat bond market had the most active quarter on record with over 30 new bonds issued involving approximately $8 billion of limit. Casualty programs faced continued underwriting scrutiny, but there was adequate capacity in the market. Excess of loss programs with US exposure saw upward pricing pressure, while quota share ceding commissions were flat to down slightly. As always, we are helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now, let me turn to our second-quarter financial performance. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.41, which is up 10% from a year ago. On an underlying basis, revenue grew 6%. Underlying revenue grew 7% in RIS and 4% in Consulting. Marsh was up 7%, Guy Carpenter 11%, Mercer 5%, and Oliver Wyman grew 3%. Overall, the second quarter saw adjusted operating income growth of 11% and our adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points year-over-year. Turning to our outlook, we are well-positioned for another great year in 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, meaningful uncertainty remains and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. Overall, I'm proud of our second-quarter performance, which demonstrates continued execution on key initiatives and momentum across our business. I'm grateful to our colleagues for their focus and determination, and the value they deliver to our clients, shareholders, and communities. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A. Good morning, David. Sure. So yeah, let me first of all, just say, I was pleased with our growth in the quarter. It was on top of a very big quarter a year ago at 11%. Marsh had good solid growth by region and practice on top of a tough comp. Guy Carpenter had an excellent quarter. Market improvements led to increased demand after a pretty volatile reinsurance market in 2023. Mercer again had another solid quarter of growth, as Mark noted in his comments, best growth -- stretch of growth in a long period of time. Health remains very strong. Wealth growth was solid and we actually saw an uptick in career growth from the first quarter. And Oliver Wyman had a very tough comp, but had good growth -- has had good growth year-to-date. And as we pointed out in the past, we'll have more quarter-to-quarter volatility than our other businesses. What I would say is broadly speaking, the macros continue to be supportive of growth. It's a risky environment we're all operating in, but GDP, inflation, labor markets, the cost -- rising cost of risk, rising cost of healthcare, all supportive. And I feel very, very -- I feel like we're very well-positioned. We have the best talent in the markets that we compete in. And so, we're positive on our outlook for the second half, that again remains a good market for us. And so we feel good about where we are. You want to go ahead, Mark? Thank you, David. Andrew, next question. Yeah, Jimmy, thanks for the question you know and I'll hand it to Nick here. But was it -- I think it's sum of both, right? But it's a -- it was a tough comp for sure, but we feel very good about the year-to-growth -- growth -- year-to-date growth. Excuse me. Nick, you want to add a little bit more depth? Thank you, Nick. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up? Mark? Thank you, Jimmy. Andrew, next question? Expense saves, can you give me a [indiscernible] Okay. Okay. Sure. Sure. Thanks, Elyse. Mark? Do you have a follow-up, Elyse? Yeah. I mean the markets are quite dynamic, right? And so, I would just caution you a little bit on pricing, right? I think Guy Carpenter is a good indication of that, right? So we saw a better market lead to increased demand. But as I mentioned earlier, it was a good solid growth by region and by practice, again in the second quarter and on top of a tough comp. But Martin, maybe you could share a little bit more color on growth international versus US and the demand you're seeing. Yeah, reflection of the liability environment in the US for sure. Thank you, Elyse, and thanks, Martin. Andrew, next question? Yeah. Sure, Scott. Thanks for the question. No change to our philosophy. We continue to take a balanced approach to capital management. We have about $4.5 billion to deploy during the course of the year. Broadly speaking, we favor attractive investments in our business, whether it's organic or inorganic over buybacks, but we're not going to let cash build up on the balance sheet either. And as I noted earlier, we increased our dividend beginning in this quarter. I mean, we aspire to raise our dividend every year. We bought back $300 million in the -- of shares in the second quarter. We're pleased with what we've seen in the -- in the M&A market. As I said, it was an active quarter. I mean, we announced a couple of deals really at the start here of the second quarter just after the 1st of July. And so, we're excited about those deals and we'll continue to be active in the market. But ultimately, the amount of share repurchase will depend on what's obviously a volatile M&A. You never know what the ultimate outcome will be in M&A but we're seeing some good opportunities to invest in our business. Do you have a follow-up? Yeah. Thanks, Scott, and I'll ask Pat to comment in a second. But I mentioned rising healthcare costs in my opening remarks. It's a big pressure point for our clients in this economy. And so -- and particularly given the tight labor markets in most major economies around the world. So -- it's really a terrific value we're delivering to our clients in a very tough marketplace there. Wealth is going to have some volatility as well Career quarter-to-quarter, but Pat, maybe you could talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the marketplace. Terrific. Thank you, Pat. Scott, thank you for your questions. Andrew, next question. Sure, sure. Sure, Mike. Thanks. Thanks for the question. I'll share some high-level thoughts, and then maybe I'll ask both Martin and Dean to talk about some market observations. I would note, Mike, just right out of the gate here that typically, larger account pricing has more volatility attached to it. If you look back on historical cycles, that's been the case. Mid-market pricing has historically been more stable or more consistent, I guess, and have less volatility from cycle to cycle. And our index is weighted towards large accounts to be clear, where we have the best data. But insurance and reinsurance markets continue to settle in the quarter after what's been many years of increases. It's not just middle versus large, it's a collection of markets. And while as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, cyber and FinPro, maybe the best example, prices continue to moderate. Some segments of the market are showing some -- what might be early signs of stress. US Excess Casualty, for example, prices were up 10%, and loss cost inflation there remains quite challenging. But overall, right now, market is providing an opportunity for our clients to revisit some decisions they've made about financing risk and that tighter market conditions led them to make uncertain decisions. So it's a welcome moment for many of our clients to revisit some of those decisions. And Guy Carpenter, as I mentioned earlier, it led to greater demand in the second quarter as evidenced by our strong growth. But Martin, maybe you could share a little bit more color on what we're seeing in the pricing market? Thanks, Martin. Dean, maybe you can just quickly cover the reinsurance market. Thanks, Dean. So, Mike, not a big shift from the first quarter, but a modest evolving market more in favor of buyers. And so that obviously factors into the advice we give to our clients and help them navigate what's a world where, again, the cost of risk continues to escalate. Do you have a follow-up? No, no. I mean at Mercer, we sold two admin businesses, one in the US, one in the UK to Aptia. And the reason we sold them is they're relatively low-growth and lower-margin businesses. And again on a relative basis, they were capital-intensive. And so we think they have a better owner now and so we feel good about that decision. Thank you, Mike. Andrew, next question, please. Yeah, it's not a business. It's part of really how we advise our clients at Marsh. And so Blue[i] is kind the brand, if you will, for our suite of analytics. And Martin, maybe you could just share some insight on the range of types of tools that we use that help our clients think about how they manage and finance risk. So we use these tools to help -- and it's really mostly upfront, but to help them understand -- our clients understand those risks, strategies to manage and mitigate those risks. We spend most of our time on these calls for good reasons, talking about the financing of risk when we go to market, but it's an important part of our value proposition. It's another example of where we can bring scale benefits to the market, given the unique data set that we have and the range of proprietary analytics we use. And while it operates under a different brand, the same will be said for the way we approach our clients in the market at Guy Carpenter. Do you have a follow-up, Greg? Sure, Greg. Yeah, it's going to be volatile from quarter-to-quarter. But Mark, maybe you can. Thank you, Mark, and thanks, Greg, for the questions. Andrew, next question, please. No. We expect margin expansion in the second half to be better than the first half. Sorry, if we created any confusion earlier, but that's what we continue to expect. And maybe I can just share a little bit of color and just remind everybody, too, margins and outcome, right? This will be year 17 of -- 17th consecutive year of margin expansion, and so we feel terrific about that. But margin is an outcome of the way we run the business. We manage investments and costs within the revenue growth of the business. It's not going to happen in every business in every single quarter, but that's -- it's the way we approach our business. We're going to continue to make attractive investments to support medium to long-term growth. But we see opportunities. As I've mentioned in the past, we've got workflow and automation efforts inside of Marsh. Mercer and Guy Carpenter. We're testing AI at scale. So that value creation is not a meaningful 2024 or probably 2025 event. But as technologies emerge, we'll continue to challenge ourselves to get better. But again, we do expect second-half margin expansion to be better than first half. Do you have a follow-up? Got it. Thank you. Andrew, next question please. Well, I'm not sure I see a direct line between that particular case and the overall environment. But what I would say to you is that -- and what we've talked about on this call historically -- or I shouldn't say historically, but over the course of the last couple of years is just troubling signs of loss cost inflation, particularly here in the United States. And the amount of large or mega judgments and settlements is quite challenging. And so we spend a lot of time, and Martin talked briefly about the suite of analytics we use. It's inside of that suite of analytics, we help our clients think about a range of outcomes, what type of limits they should consider buying, how they might benchmark anonymously against others in their industry as an example. But that's -- those are all important inputs and ultimately, our clients make decisions and judgments and some have the ability to finance more risk or choose to finance more risk on their own. And others will look to finance risk on the balance sheets of insurance companies or in certain cases to capital markets as well. So I hope that's helpful, Meyer? No, I don't think there's a real change from the first quarter. As Pat mentioned some of the dynamics, less active labor markets from a turnover point of view, lower comp [and ban] (ph) so it's a -- we didn't have expectations of higher growth in that business during the course of 2024, and we haven't seen anything through six months that changes that outlook. Thank you. Andrew, time for maybe one more? Yeah. Again, I -- just to be clear, we're not looking to build a third-party wholesale business. We want to bring the best solutions to our clients. The E&S markets moved quite a bit over the course of the last several years. That's really a reflection of the high risk environment that I've talked about where insurers have, broadly speaking, more freedom to change rate, to get off risk, to change price -- or to change terms and conditions as well. And so just broadly speaking, we want to manage our clients' outcomes and experiences directly as possible and not outsource what's an important part of the value proposition. It's not to say that wholesalers don't do a nice job for us, they do and we'll continue to access them where it makes sense. But -- but we -- most of the -- majority of the wholesale premium, we actually access directly today or E&S markets, we do that directly today. But there's been more growth in intermediated wholesale premium over the course of the last couple of years. And so our efforts are to try to get as much access to market as we can. Do you have a follow-up, Robert? Yeah. The economics can be different, of course, and they're different from treaty to treaty as well. We work with our insurance company clients. As we talked about when the market was particularly tight last year, while commission is a factor and growing price was a factor in many respects, really what we do with our large insurance company clients is big wholesale relationships where effectively we work on, what amounts to a fee. Thank you. Go ahead, Andrew. Thanks, Andrew, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter."

            "content": "Yeah. I think John is right, Jimmy, it's a little bit of both, but in the same way that I noted last quarter that our 13% was against a weak 0% comp, this 3% is against a tougher 11%. That 8% year-to-date, I think is bang in that zone of mid to high-single-digit growth we expect to average through the cycle. And as you know, our quarters are always somewhat volatile. Mark kindly noted in his comments that the first half actually accelerated versus the first half last year. To give you a little bit of color on where we are seeing higher growth, regionally, both Asia and our India, Middle-East, and Africa regions have continued on strong growth. From an industry perspective, our communications, media, and technology practice has been our fastest-growing year-to-date, but our very strong banking and insurance practices also in positive territory as is our public sector practice. And we have a wide array of capabilities. And our economic research business, NERA, growing strongly. Our market-leading finance and risk practice, particularly in financial services, our pricing team. And importantly, our people and organizational performance practice, which really works across our industries to help on big client transformative moments. But the market is a little bit uncertain. While the economy seems to be better, it's still a pressured environment for discretionary spending, some uncertainties as John and Mark have highlighted. And we do see -- we're sort of working through some pricing pressure due to excess capacity as some of our competitors work through some of their headcount actions."

            "name": "Martin South",
            "content": "Sure. So just to restate 7% in the quarter, which is on top of 10% for the second quarter of '23. Quite balanced growth, the international at 7% and the US at 6% -- US and Canada at 6%. Our US business MMA and Victor continued to perform very well in the US. Canada had a weaker quarter, some macros there affected that, that pulled down a little bit. But across the international region, international was a 7% on top of 10% in '23. Asia-Pacific accelerated from 7% on top of 6% in '23, and Latin-America did 8% on top of 17% in the second quarter of '23 and EMEA did 7% on top of 11% in '23. The performance was driven really by very strong performance internationally in the benefits business. Construction, energy, and power all came off strong double-digit growth as well, repeating what happened last year. And we're beginning to see some revitalization in the US capital markets, which has been a headwind for new business growth going back to '21. Renewal base growth was strong and solid, as was new business in both US and Canada and international. And our lost business improved slightly as we continue to build stickier relationships with clients as we engage more deeply, and we aspire to be the risk advisor of the future, talking to them well beyond conventional risk. We feel very well-positioned. Overall, the mix of premium in the US will be more weighted to casualty in its broad terms and probably more balanced in international for property-casualty to answer your -- in terms of property to answer your question. Sure. Just reminding ourselves, 26 quarters of rate increases, which just turned flat now. And as John noted, the -- our index is geared much more towards the larger account segment of our business. And obviously, the mid-market business in the smaller end has less volatility in pricing. But just by line of business, casualty in the US is up 3%, which, as John said, is really dominated by the 10% increase in the umbrella book, which we talked about in earlier calls about the volatility in claims inflation there. Property is flat in most regions, except for the Middle East and India, where we're still seeing some increases in property, maybe as a result of some of the activity in the Middle East in this past quarter. Core FinPro contracting at 5%, with rate decline pretty much across the world, and cyber contracting 6% which is mostly consistent with what we saw in Q1. The pricing trends consistent with recent quarters, we're seeing some slight increases in geographies, but rate contraction is more than normal. And so those are the key issues really that I would comment on now. But of course, as far as our business is concerned, we -- a lot of our business is fee-based or controlled commission basis, and exposure growth has been significant over the last few years as well, which is a counterweight to that. Sure. So as you said, John, this is a suite of analytics tools that we use to help our clients across different product lines assess what risks to retain, what risk they could transfer, the economic cost of that. We pay them across multiple lines to give them exposure and total cost of risk scenarios. We help them analyze claims and the analytics tools in that are able to help our clients who self-insure a lot of losses to identify which losses they need to get at early and how to settled those. So it's a range of real-time analytics built really, and it's one of the unique things about our business is that we have an enormous lake of data, and we think that's one of the big moats that we have to support our business. And some of these analytics tools that we use, we call them generically Blue[i]. We deploy on clients that actually don't even buy insurance. They tend to be some of our biggest clients in the US. So we'll continue to invest in that. And as we announced in the call last year, we added to that with supply chain capability and -- so it's the way clients expect to be engaged, and that's the tool that we use."

            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning. Our second-quarter results were strong with solid underlying growth, significant margin expansion, and 10% growth in adjusted EPS. Our consolidated revenue increased 6% to $6.2 billion with underlying growth of 6%. Operating income was $1.6 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.7 billion, up 11%. Our adjusted operating margin increased 130 basis points to 29%. GAAP EPS was $2.27 and adjusted EPS was $2.41. For the first six months of 2024, underlying revenue growth was 8%, our adjusted operating income grew 11% to $3.7 billion, our adjusted operating margin increased 100 basis points and our adjusted EPS increased 12% to $5.30. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, second-quarter revenue was $4 billion, up 8% from a year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This result marks the 14th consecutive quarter of 7% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. RIS operating income was $1.3 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was also $1.3 billion, up 12% over last year and our adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 35.3%. For the first six months of the year, revenue in RIS was $8.3 billion with underlying growth of 8%, adjusted operating income increased 12% to $2.9 billion and our margin increased 90 basis points to 37.3%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter was $3.3 billion, up 8% from a year ago or 7% on an underlying basis. This strong growth came on top of 10% growth in the second quarter of last year. Growth in the second quarter reflected strong new business and solid renewals. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 6% for the quarter. International underlying growth was 7%. EMEA was up 7%, Asia-Pacific grew 7%, and Latin America was up 8%. For the first six months of the year, Marsh's revenue was $6.3 billion with underlying growth of 7%. US and Canada grew 7% and international was up 8%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $632 million in the quarter, up 10% or 11% on an underlying basis. This terrific result came on top of 11% growth last year and was driven by double-digit growth across most geographies and specialties. For the first six months of the year, Guy Carpenter generated $1.8 billion of revenue and 9% underlying growth. In the Consulting segment, second quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, up 2% from a year ago or 4% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $410 million and adjusted operating income was $426 million, up 6%. Our adjusted operating margin in Consulting was 19.8% in the second quarter, an increase of 60 basis points. For the first six months of 2024, Consulting revenue was $4.4 billion, reflecting underlying growth of 6%. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $870 million and our margin increased 50 basis points to 20.3%. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, flat compared to a year ago, but up 5% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's 13th straight quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth and continues the best run of growth in 15 years. Wealth grew 3%, driven by growth in both Investment Management and DB Consulting. Our assets under management were $492 billion at the end of the second quarter, up 1% sequentially and up 25% compared to the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transaction with Vanguard, impact of capital markets, and positive net flows. Health underlying growth remained strong at 9% and reflected growth across all regions. Career revenue increased 2%, continuing the trend of modest growth following a two-year stretch of strong growth in demand. For the first six months of the year, revenue at Mercer was $2.8 billion with 6% underlying growth. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the quarter was $837 million, an increase of 3% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 11% growth a year ago. For the first six months of the year, revenue at Oliver Wyman was $1.6 billion, an increase of 8% on an underlying basis, up from 6% growth in the first half of last year. Foreign exchange was a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.02 headwind in the third quarter and $0.02 in the fourth quarter. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $73 million. These included $44 million of restructuring costs, mostly related to the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2022 as well as some transaction-related expenses. Our other net benefit credit was $66 million in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect our other net benefit credit will be approximately $265 million. Interest expense in the second quarter was $156 million, up from $146 million in the second quarter last year, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect approximately $154 million of interest expense in the third quarter and approximately $620 million for the full year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter was 26.2% compared with 24.2% in the second quarter of last year. Our tax rate in both periods benefited from favorable discrete items. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25.5% and 26.5% for 2024. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total debt of $13.5 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the first quarter of 2025 when $500 million of senior notes mature. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital in 2024 across dividends, acquisitions, and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how the M&A pipeline develops. Last week, we announced a 15% increase to our quarterly dividend, making this our 15th consecutive year of dividend growth. This comes on top of a 20% increase a year ago and reflects our strong earnings growth and confidence in our outlook. Our cash position at the end of the second quarter was $1.7 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1.2 billion and included $352 million for dividends, $500 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. For the first six months, uses of cash totaled $2.2 billion and included $706 million for dividends, $847 million for acquisitions, and $600 million for share repurchases. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and the current environment remains supportive of growth. Overall, our excellent first half leaves us well-positioned for another great year in 2024. Based on our outlook today, for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion, and strong growth in adjusted EPS. And with that, I'm happy to turn it back to John. Yeah. We're really happy with 130 basis points and it validated the statements we made about the first-quarter margin expansion facing headwinds from several items. So we were good -- we're glad to see the acceleration and we're on track for solid margin expansion for the year. Jimmy, there is -- there is seasonality in balances as we've talked about in the past. But I think the biggest driver, I think, from here is just going to be the outlook for rates. As we've talked about and you saw on our balance sheet in the quarter, we've got about $11.5 billion of fiduciary balances and so I think just where we go from here is just going to be what the central banks do with short-term interest rates. And just as you're modeling going forward, keep in mind that our balances do reflect the revenue mix of our business. So it's not just US rates, obviously that drive -- we've got balances because of the distributed nature of business all over the world. So yeah, so as I said, the outlook really is going to be mostly a function of what the rate picture looks like. Yeah. Elyse, we're definitely seeing the benefit of it. We've stayed away from quantifying specifically how much is going to drop quarter-to-quarter. But you just even see the trend in expense growth quarter-to-quarter that was definitely a factor. Our strong growth and the benefit of savings contributed to that 130 basis points of margin expansion. So we're -- as I said, we haven't quantified the amount that we're seeing each quarter, but we are on track for the level of savings that we talked about and we're seeing the benefit of it. Yeah, Greg. Thanks. You will -- we always -- we'll always caution against focusing too much on a quarter's results, and that's certainly true when it comes to cash flows and free cash flow. They tend to be volatile, not only quarter to quarter, but year to year because of timing of balance sheet items. As you -- so when you look at the six months, we are seeing a decline of course, given the significant bonus payouts that we have in the first quarter, you have a little bit of a denominator -- small denominator issue. And so, you have to be cautious. But two big factors just in the first six months are the higher comp payouts that we had in the first quarter and then receivables are up because of the growth in the business. But we've got a, as you know, a long track record of double-digit growth in free cash flow that has stacked up well against our growth in earnings, and that's what you'd expect in a capital-light business like ours."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Marsh McLennan's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. First quarter 2024 financial results and supplemental information were issued earlier this morning. They are available on the company's website at marshmclennan.com. Please note that remarks made today may include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and a variety of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such statements. For a more detailed discussion of those factors, please refer to our earnings release for this quarter and to our most recent SEC filings, including our most recent Form 10-K, all of which are available on the Marsh McLennan website. During the call today, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most closely comparable GAAP measures, please refer to the schedule in today's earnings release. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn this over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan.\nJohn Doyle: Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman; and Pat Tomlinson of Mercer, who is joining us -- joining this call for the first time. Welcome, Pat. Also with us today is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan had a strong start to 2024. Our first quarter results were excellent, and we are well-positioned for another good year. Top-line [Technical Difficulty] continued with 9% underlying revenue growth, which was on top of 9% growth in the first quarter of last year. All of our businesses had strong revenue growth with Marsh, Mercer and Oliver Wyman accelerating growth from the fourth quarter. We grew adjusted operating income by 11% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023. We had adjusted EPS growth of 14%. And we completed $300 million of share repurchases in the quarter. In addition, we continue to add to our talent, capabilities and scale through acquisitions. These investments will help strengthen our strategic position and sustain top-line growth. For example, Mercer completed the purchase of Vanguard's OCIO business, which expands our reach into the endowments and foundation segment. MMA acquired two leading agencies in Louisiana, and Oliver Wyman closed the acquisition of SeaTec, which extends our capabilities in the aviation, transportation and defense industries. At Marsh McLennan, we bring together specialized capabilities and perspectives across risk, strategy and people to help clients make critical decisions with confidence. For example, in the area of supply chain risk, we developed a solution called [Centrisk] (ph), which draws on the perspective and capabilities of Marsh and Oliver Wyman to identify key risks in our client supply chains. Using this framework, we create a digital twin model of a client supply lines, which provides for a scenario-based vulnerability assessment to help manage risk. This product is already helping clients across multiple sectors, including in the banking, manufacturing, aviation and defense industries. As we noted last quarter, Marsh, Oliver Wyman and Guy Carpenter developed the Unity facility, a public-private insurance solution that enables grain shipments from Ukrainian ports. In the first quarter, we worked with the Ukrainian government, DZ Bank, Lloyd's and others to expand the facility to all ships carrying non-military cargo. This will help support Ukraine's economic resilience in time of war. In the healthcare sector, Marsh and Mercer are working together to help clients evaluate connections between talent retention, patient safety and the cost of malpractice insurance. Marsh's risk assessment capabilities and Mercer's extensive health and human capital expertise, combined with our rich datasets, are creating new, highly-valued perspectives in the healthcare sector. These are just a few examples of how we're applying our unique expertise to address pressing challenges and deliver significant value to clients. Recently, we released our Annual ESG Report. The report includes enhanced disclosure on our ESG efforts and underscores how the actions we're taking [Technical Difficulty] and on behalf of our clients also have a positive impact on the communities where we live and work. Let me share some examples. We collaborated with the Center for NYC Neighborhoods to launch a community-based catastrophe insurance program. This parametric insurance program helps finance emergency grants to community members following an event, with funds reaching households within days of a catastrophe. In cyber, we developed a global personal microinsurance solution to protect against threats like online identity theft, viruses, cyber-bullying and failure to deliver purchased goods. With regard to sustainability, we are supporting the Dubai Energy and Water Authority's commitment to provide 100% of its energy from clean sources by 2050. As part of this work, we conducted a client -- a climate resilience assessment of one of the world's largest solar parks. We modeled the site's ability to withstand future climate conditions and proposed adaptation measures to mitigate extreme risks. We continue to improve sustainability in our own operations as well. For example, in 2023, we expanded the use of renewable electricity across our US offices and in our largest UK locations. And we submitted our climate targets for validation as part of our goal to achieve net zero globally by 2050. We remain committed to generating exceptional financial performance and returns for shareholders, and we also recognize that the successful outcomes we help enable for our clients and our own actions can have a lasting positive effect on communities around the world. Shifting to the macro picture, we see significant opportunity to help clients navigate the range of outcomes driven by a more complex environment. The geopolitical backdrop remains unsettled with multiple major wars and rising tensions globally. More than half the world's population will go to elections in 2024, and the economic outlook remains uncertain as well. Despite this uncertainty, the environment is supportive of growth in our business. In general, we see continued economic growth in most of our major markets, inflation and interest rates remain elevated, labor markets are tight, the cost of risk is up, and healthcare costs continue to rise. We have a strong record of performance across economic cycles due to the resilience of our business and demand for our advice and solutions. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, primary insurance rates increased, with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 1% overall in the quarter. Property rates increased 3% versus 6% in the fourth quarter. Casualty was up 3%, in line with last quarter. Workers' compensation decreased mid-single digits while financial and professional liability rates were down 7%, and cyber pricing decreased 6%. Reinsurance market conditions remained stable, with increased client demand and adequate capacity. In the April renewal period, US property cat reinsurance rates were flat with some decreases for accounts without losses. Loss-impacted accounts averaged increases in the 10% to 20% range. The US casualty reinsurance market was challenging, but rates were in line with January renewals. In January, April 1 property cat rates overall were down slightly on a risk-adjusted basis. Early signs for June 1 Florida cat risk renewals point to improved market conditions for cedents. Increased reinsurance appetite for growth should be adequate to meet higher demand. As always, we are helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now, let me turn briefly to our first quarter financial performance, which Mark will cover in detail. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.89, which is up 14% versus a year ago. Revenue grew 9% on an underlying basis with 9% growth in both RIS and in consulting. Marsh was up 8%, Guy Carpenter grew 8%, Mercer 6%, and Oliver Wyman was up 13%. Overall, in the first quarter, we had adjusted operating income growth of 11%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points year-over-year. Turning to our outlook, we are very well-positioned for another good year in 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, meaningful uncertainty remains and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. In summary, the first quarter was a great start to the year for Marsh McLennan. Our business delivered strong performance and we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives. I'm proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value they deliver to our clients and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results.\nMark McGivney: Thank you, John, and good morning. Our first quarter results were outstanding and represent an excellent start to the year. We saw continued momentum in underlying growth, strong margin expansion, double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Our consolidated revenue increased 9% in the first quarter to $6.5 billion, underlying growth of 9%. Operating income was $1.9 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 11% to $2 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to 32%, and we expect higher margin expansion for the rest of the year, particularly in the second half. GAAP EPS was $2.82, and adjusted EPS was $2.89, up 14% [Technical Difficulty] last year. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 9% compared with a year ago on both a reported and underlying basis. This result marks the 12th consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. RIS operating income was $1.6 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income was also $1.6 billion, up 11% over last year, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 39.1%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter increased 9% to $3 billion or 8% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 9% growth in the first quarter of last year. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 8% for the quarter, reflecting solid renewal and new business growth. In international, underlying growth was strong at 8% and comes on top of 10% in the first quarter last year. EMEA was up 9%, Latin America grew 8%, and Asia-Pacific was up 6%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $1.1 billion, up 7%, or 8% on an underlying basis, driven by growth across most regions and Global Specialties. This was the fifth straight quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth at Guy Carpenter. In the Consulting segment, first quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, up 9% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $432 million, and adjusted operating income was $444 million, up 9%. Our adjusted operating margin in Consulting was 20.7% in the first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's 12th straight quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth and continues the best run of growth in 15 years. Health underlying growth was 10% and reflected strong momentum across all regions. Wealth grew 5%, driven by growth in both investment management and DB Consulting. Our assets under management were $489 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 17% sequentially and up 38% compared to the first quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transactions with Westpac and Vanguard, rebounding capital markets and positive net flows. Career revenue increased 1%, reflecting a tough comparison to a period of strong growth last year, as well as softness in the US. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the first quarter was $789 million, up 13% on an underlying basis from the slow start we had in the first quarter of last year, and reflected strength across all regions. Foreign exchange had very little impact on earnings in the first quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter and a further $0.01 headwind in the second half. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $49 million. The majority of these items were restructuring costs, mostly related to the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our other net benefit credit was $67 million in the quarter. For the full year, we expect our other net benefit credit will be approximately $265 million. Interest expense in the first quarter was $159 million, up from $136 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect $158 million of interest expense in the second quarter and approximately $620 million for the full year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.9% compared with 25% in the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation, similar to a year ago. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25.5% and 26.5% for 2024. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total debt of $13.5 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the second quarter, when $600 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1.5 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion, and included $354 million for dividends, $347 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital in 2024 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how our M&A pipeline develops. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and the current environment remains supportive of growth. Overall, our strong start leaves us well-positioned for another good year in 2024. Based on our outlook today, for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on the Marsh growth. John, I caught what you said on the global pricing index, which moved down or decelerated a little bit to 1% from 2% last quarter. But the Marsh organic growth accelerated to 8% this quarter from 6% last quarter. So, I'm hoping you can help me bridge the gap between accelerating growth and the decelerating pricing.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, David, for the question, and good morning. We work very hard not to be an index on P&C pricing, right? It's an element. It's a macro factor that obviously does have some impact. But less than half of Marsh's revenue is exposed to P&C pricing. What I would also say to you is that where we're most exposed to commission is in the middle-market. Our index skews to larger account data. Pricing is up a bit more in the middle-market than it is in the large account segment, and typically is less cyclical than what you see in the large account market. But I want to just talk about growth overall. I was very pleased with the start to the year, 9% on top of 9% last year and accelerated growth from the fourth quarter of 7%, as I mentioned. Marsh, Mercer and Oliver Wyman all had accelerated growth from the fourth quarter. The macros continue to be supportive, David. Solid GDP growth in most major markets, although it's under a bit of pressure. Inflation and interest rates remain elevated. There's tight labor markets, as I said before, rising healthcare cost. The overall cost of risk continues to increase. And demand remains very strong. Not long out of the pandemic, of course, we've got a couple of global wars happening, supply chain stress. Our clients are showing broader risk awareness. We're talking to them about that and really trying to help them find better balance between resilience and efficiency. And we continue to invest through this cycle, right? I talked about a couple of the acquisitions we did. We're improving our mix of business as well. We sold some admin businesses at Mercer in the quarter. And I'm very, very pleased with how our colleagues are executing, too. We've been working on our client engagement model and improving that, continue to invest in sales operations. And as I've talked about, over the course of the last year, we're collaborating more than ever. It starts with the talent that we have. We have the best talent in the markets that we operate in. We're, of course, not immune to macros, including pricing on some level, but we're a resilient business and we're quite excited about 2024. Do you have a follow-up?\nDavid Motemaden: I do. And thanks for that answer, that's helpful. I guess, just specifically zeroing in on the US and Canada within Marsh, that had a nice acceleration in the quarter. Could you talk about the drivers specifically for that business? Was it middle-market, was it your capital markets activity coming back and sort of your outlook on the sustainability, further recovery and growth there?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, yeah. Marsh in the US got off to a terrific start, US and Canada, I would point out. And Martin, maybe you could give David a little bit more color.\nMartin South: Yeah. It wasn't just the US and Canada, it was great balanced growth across the business. But I'll dig into the US a little bit and give you some color on some of the drivers of growth there. And it's really been a product of a lot of work in the last few years to get where we are. So, the overall growth of 8%, our businesses -- the mid-market business, MMA, had a terrific start to the year. The growth in that business is driven both by renewal and fantastic new business. Victor, our MGA business, rebounded, has a great performance, very strong performance in Canada. [Just they] (ph) had a tough year last year, it bounced back and the core business in the US grew nicely. So, very good. The drivers really, particularly in the specialty areas, construction was very strong in the first quarter. Our MMB business was strong. Our advisory business in the US was very strong as part of the risk advisor of the future to the tip of the spear and makes our relationship much stickier. So, our renewal growth was good. And our loss business rate was down. So, we feel very good about all the areas that we've been focusing on, about client relationship, specialization, industry focus advisory, all these things are the drivers for growth. So, we feel very good about things.\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Martin. David, I would add, it wasn't a bang-out quarter in terms of M&A activity in our transaction risk business, but it's a smaller part of our -- smaller part of our business now. It's a little feedback there. It's a smaller part of our business after the slowdown. So, the impact was less. But we did see some volume in M&A activity pick up during the quarter, which of course is encouraging. So, thank you for your questions. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.\nJimmy Bhullar: Good morning. So, I was wondering if you could just elaborate on the comments John had on the reinsurance market. And it seems like things -- the market is less tight than it was over the past year. But what are you seeing in terms of buyer behavior? Are cedents trying to buy more, given that pricing has come in a little bit, or are they trying to save money and keep sort of coverage levels consistent with what they've had in the past year?\nJohn Doyle: Sure, Jimmy. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll elaborate a little bit on some of my prepared remarks and then ask Dean to talk a bit about the reinsurance market. But I think both markets continue to stabilize on average in the quarter. And again, I would remind everyone it's a collection of markets, not a single market. That stabilization is good for our clients. And in some cases, a better market has led to increased demand in both insurance and reinsurance. I would also point out that in recent years, we've had higher premium growth in the captives that we manage at Marsh compared to the premium flow into the traditional market. That may change a bit now, we'll see as markets stabilize and our clients can adjust to what the market looks like going forward. I mentioned earlier our index skews to major accounts. So, pricing in the middle-market continues to move up a bit more than the data points I mentioned earlier. But I would also say that insurers and reinsurers are cautious about that rising cost-of-risk environment that I mentioned as well. And so, while again, a stabilizing market is better for our clients overall, I don't expect that relative stability to change anytime soon given some of the rising cost of risk issues that the insurance community is confronting. So, Dean, maybe you can talk a little bit more about what's happening in reinsurance.\nDean Klisura: Yeah. Thanks, John. And Jimmy, I'll give you a little bit more color on the April 1 reinsurance renewal, that would be helpful. As John noted, we saw a continuation of market conditions that we experienced at January 1. And as John noted, market conditions are stable, but we're definitely seeing increased client demand to provide additional property cat limit, particularly at the top end of programs. That was very pronounced throughout the first quarter at 1/1 through the quarter. And certainly that trend continued on April 1. Strong capital inflows into the reinsurance market, driven by strong reinsurer returns, double-digit returns in 2023. We talked about last quarter on the call, reinsurer appetite has increased for property cat. There is an inflow of capital and capacity. Competition at the top end of programs, it's been good for both buyers and sellers in the marketplace. Specifically to property cat, in the US, at April 1, as I said, capacity was strong. As John noted, the market was generally flat to down incrementally for clients without cat losses. Accounts with cat losses saw 10% to 20% kind of rate increases. But keep in mind, we give you rate-adjusted figures. But when you factor in inflation, exposure growth, value growth, premiums on these cat programs are still increasing year-over-year. It continues to be a tailwind for Guy Carpenter in the marketplace. And as I said, there's a lot of competition for cat business. US casualty, as John noted, was challenging, just as challenging on April 1 as it was at the January 1 renewal. Reinsurers are exerting pressure on pricing in terms and conditions. Ceding commissions are facing downward pressure from reinsurers on certain quota-share contracts, particularly financial lines, which Martin has talked about in the past. Excess-of-loss contracts are seeing rate increases across the board, in some cases, double-digit. However, there was adequate casualty capacity in the marketplace at April 1, and all of the programs that we placed got completed in full. But I would balance that against continued reinsurer concern with the adverse development, driven by social inflation and increasing loss cost trends. I think that's a good summary of where we were in the US market. Just a note on Japan. Big April 1 cat date in Japan, a very orderly market, sufficient capacity, many cat programs were oversubscribed. We didn't observe any structural changes. Attachment points stayed where they were from a year ago. And again, it was a market that was down on average 5% from a rating perspective, and we didn't really observe any rate impact from the January earthquake in Japan. Overall, a very orderly market at April 1 in Japan.\nJohn Doyle: Terrific, Dean. Thank you. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up?\nJimmy Bhullar: [Technical Difficulty] income, it was flat sequentially and lower than 3Q. I'm assuming that's more seasonality. But if you could just talk about your expectation for that given where short-term rates are currently?\nJohn Doyle: Mark, you want to jump on that one?\nMark McGivney: Yeah. Jimmy, there is a little season, as you pointed out. There is a little -- tends to be a little seasonality in our fiduciary balances. Q1 and Q4 tend to be seasonal lows modestly. So that would explain that. In terms of outlook, we'll see what happens to the rate environment. The interest -- our fiduciary interest income is going to be a function of balances and rates, and we've got about $11.5 billion of balances. So, depending on what you want to assume for the trajectory of rates, the math is pretty straightforward.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Mark. And thank you, Jimmy. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. Good morning. My first question was on the margin guidance. You guys said more margin expansion in the back half of the year. What's driving that? Is there just more investment in the first half, more savings falling in the second half, or something else that's driving the seasonality within the margin expansion this year?\nJohn Doyle: Good morning, Elyse. We expect again good margin expansion in 2024. As you pointed out, Mark noted, we expect the second half to be better than the first half. We have some expected headwinds, not really seasonality, but really driven from a higher [merit pool] (ph) a year ago, some acquisition-related costs, and some higher reimbursable expenses. But I want to remind everybody not to focus on any one particular quarter. Again, margin is an outcome of really how we run the business, and it's not a primary objective of ours. Again, having said that, we see opportunity for margin improvement, continued margin improvement. But we're going to continue to make attractive investments to support the medium to long-term growth of the business. We have a number of different efforts underway, ongoing workflow and automation efforts at Marsh, Mercer and Guy Carpenter. And we continue to press for opportunities to improve efficiency at the intersections of our businesses as well. So, we see opportunity. And as we pointed out, we expect the second half to be better than the first. Do you have a follow-up, Elyse?\nElyse Greenspan: Yes, thanks. And then my second question, Marsh recently launched its wholesale venture Victor Access. I know it's early days, but what was the impetus for this strategy? And is there any reason why the majority of the wholesale risk currently placed by Marsh with third-party wholesalers couldn't potentially be internalized through Victor over time?\nJohn Doyle: So, let me be clear, Elyse, we're not looking to build a third-party wholesale business. There's obviously been considerable growth in the wholesaler to E&S market over the course of the last several years. We want to bring the best solutions in the marketplace to our clients. Generally, we're preferring admitted solutions for our clients. Not that there aren't good things that happen in the E&S market. Of course, there are, and innovation is one of the areas where the E&S market is important. But we want to access as much of that E&S market directly. We actually access most of our E&S market solutions directly today. But we want to continue to press and make sure that we can access as much of that market directly. So, it's client-driven, It's about us managing the client outcomes, client experiences, really as directly as possible. Having said that, we'll continue to use wholesalers for niche expertise. They serve us very well and our clients very well. In those cases, they also have strong program businesses as well. So, anyway, that's what it's about. It's just, again, making sure we can directly access as much capital directly as possible for our clients. Thank you for that. Andrew, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to pivot to -- for the first question, pivot to the Consulting business, which had a nice quarter. I'm wondering if you can provide some additional color around how the different pieces are moving. I know some of the management consultants have pre-announced that they're going to be cutting staff this year. Not really seeing any signs of weakness in your pipeline, but maybe you could give us some color, because forecasting this out seems to be a little bit of a black box?\nJohn Doyle: Okay. Thanks, Greg. Yeah, we are very pleased with the start to the year. As you recall, of course, Oliver Wyman had a slow start to the year in 2023, had a nice year overall of growth. There's going to be a bit more volatility to revenue growth at Oliver Wyman, but we also expect better growth on average from Oliver Wyman over the medium to longer term. Nick, maybe you can share with Greg some color on demand in the first quarter.\nNick Studer: Thank you, John, and thank you, Greg. Yeah, 13% was a very pleasing start to the year, it makes a marvelous headline, and we're very, very proud of a good start on what, as you noted, is a tough environment for many in our profession. John has already given the caution about taking the two-year view. We also probably benefited from a few little timing benefits of things that might have shown up in Q2, might have shown up in Q1. And we still very much give guidance through the cycle. This should be a mid-to-high single-digit business. And you noted the sort of forecasting it out is a tricky challenge. That is true because we have a relatively short backlog. The nature of our work is such that when clients need assistance, they need it quickly. And so, we are always ready to move very, very nimbly. To give you a little bit more color, we grew pretty strongly across all the four regions of our management consulting business and our economic research business, NERA, also grew very strongly, fastest in the Middle East, but in the double-digits or very close to double-digits in all three of the other major regions we have. And sectorally, it was also fairly broadly spread. Our communications media and technology team grew well, healthcare grew well, banking seeing a rebound in private capital work, which I've noted on previous calls, has been pretty robust even in the face of obviously a very much lower deal market, but our work on portfolio company performance has helped us there. But insurance also growing, and quite broadly across the capabilities that we bring to bear as well. So, we think we're in a good position. We're very confident we gained share over the last few years, but it's a tough consulting environment. And our pipeline indicates that mid-to-high single-digit growth environment, growth forecast, is how we think about this business through the cycle.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Nick. That's very helpful. And Greg, maybe I'll ask Pat Tomlinson also to share some thoughts just on the first quarter at Mercer, given our consulting operations there. And Pat, while you have the floor, as I mentioned, obviously, you're joining this call for the first time. Maybe you could talk a bit about your priorities at Mercer.\nPat Tomlinson: Sure. Thanks, John. Yes, we are pleased with our Q1 2024 underlying growth, as mentioned earlier, of 6%. It was our 12th consecutive quarter with 5% or more growth, especially the breadth across the practices. Health, another impressive quarter with 10% growth in Q1. That growth was really [Technical Difficulty] double-digit growth nearly across all regions. And it comes on the back of investments in hiring new talent, focus on thought leadership, creating digital tools and really focusing in on client segmentation, trying to match client healthcare needs, based upon industry segment size with the innovative and adaptive solutions that we have. So, really trying to meet clients where they are. We certainly benefited from strong retention. We had good renewal growth. Insurer revenue and medical cost inflation has an impact there. We see significant demand for digital solutions and the innovative benefits that are kind of underscoring the value that we're providing to clients. If I pivot over to wealth, we grew 5% in Q1. There was good, balanced, equally strong performance in [DB&A] (ph) and IMS. We see DB plans funding statuses continue to benefit from elevated interest rates that's driving an increase in risk transfer over the last couple of years, as well as we have some regulatory requirements and demands that are creating some project work. If you add in some capital -- some volatile capital markets, it's driving strong demand for both our actuarial and our investment solutions business. Speaking of investment solutions, in OCIO, we benefited from some transactions in Westpac and Vanguard, Mark mentioned that earlier, but also good net new inflows and capital markets provided us some revenue lift in Q1. From a career perspective, growth was muted to 1% for the quarter, but we're following a period of strong growth over the past several years, including a challenging 12% comparable last year. The growth was strong in international, is very broad across all practices and regions. We did see, as was mentioned, some softness in US career, specifically in rewards in the transformation space, as I would say, clients are starting to navigate some of the macro conditions, right? So, let me highlight the career practices coming off that very long period of high growth. As I mentioned, double-digits in -- for the past eight quarters, driven in large part, I would say, by inflation and employee attrition. If we all remember the great resignation back coming out of the pandemic, which drove a lot of labor shortages and really created a lot of demand for projects with clients as they were trying to think about the rewards and how to pay people to keep them retained, the skills that they might need if they had to pivot, because they didn't have the right resources, and also starting to think about transformation as they were having less resources to work with, and there was innovation in technology, as we've all talked about AI, in the past and helping clients through those. So certainly, I think from that perspective, we feel good that there's good breadth of our solutions and demand in the market as we go ahead and fill those needs. John quickly asked me to talk a little bit about how I think about the business and the priorities too. So, obviously, my first call. On April 1, I got to step in and begin this opportunity of a lifetime leading Mercer and our 21,000 colleagues from around the world, as we are focused on creating brighter futures for our clients and for their people. I am extremely humbled and honored to be the CEO of this fantastic firm. And personally, I really want to thank Martine Ferland for a very smooth transition and for the growth momentum and culture that she helped create here. Priority-wise, I want to accelerate that momentum. From the impact that we're having to clients to the fantastic careers we build for colleagues here, the collaboration amongst our colleagues across Marsh McLennan, we can leverage new technologies, and we perform really purpose-driven work, and can have a positive impact on our communities as well. I think we're very well-positioned, as we've been repositioning ourselves over the last several years, reshaping our portfolio. Mark mentioned the divestitures. We've been divesting admin practices. We've been building capabilities and reach and global benefits in OCIO. We've been accelerating acquisitions and we're really just creating more value for clients at scale. And that's what we've been focused in on. So, I'm very optimistic about our future.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you, Pat. We're excited to have you at this table. Greg, do you have a follow-up?\nGreg Peters: I do. Thanks for the detail on that answer. I want to pivot to M&A. And specifically, Mark, I think you mentioned the interest expense outlook for the company and we note the higher interest rate cost of the debt that's being issued versus that which is being paid off. So, I'm curious if there's been any follow-through on those higher costs in the terms of valuation of transactions that you're looking at. And, I'm also curious if there's any valuation difference between larger properties versus smaller properties that you're looking at in the M&A market. Thank you.\nJohn Doyle: Yeah. Thanks, Greg. What I would say is we remain quite active in the market. There's a good -- we have a good strong pipeline, as I've talked about in the past, we have an excellent reputation in that marketplace as being a good owner as well. So, we're excited about the deals we did in the first quarter. And again, we're going to continue to remain active in the market. I think valuations have remained stubbornly high, I would say, on the other side of things. And while we might expect that for top-quality assets, I would also point out that some lesser-quality assets have traded at some very, very high multiples of late. And so, we're going to be picky. We're looking for well-led businesses with real strong growth fundamentals that make us better and are a good cultural fit for our organization. We've been very successful at it. And again, as Mark pointed out, we expect to continue to deploy capital in the market going forward. Thank you, Greg. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, great. Good morning. Probably for Mark on the margins and the expense bucket. If I look over the last year-plus, the margin improvements come much more so from the general and other bucket, rather than comp and ben. It looks like that it flipped a little bit that relationship this quarter, if I'm correct. Anything changing there, given the expense management programs, or just in terms of how we should think about where the margin improvement is coming from on a go-forward basis?\nJohn Doyle: Thanks, Mike. Mark, you want to...\nMark McGivney: Yeah, I think it's a great point that you're making and I think it reflects the strategy of the company. We've said we continually invest in positioning ourselves for the future. And over the last several years, we've talked about the heavy investments we've made organically in talent. And so, I think we've done a terrific job of really being thoughtful about all of our other operating expenses, functional costs, how we're leveraging things across the firm, T&E. Really some of the gains we made in the pandemic, we've harvested them. So, as you point out, a lot of our margin expansion over the last five years has come from being really disciplined on things far away from the client and investing heavily in client-facing talent. And so, I think that is a factor in our growth. And I think also as we look forward, there's going to be leverage in those investments, which is why we're optimistic about margins going forward.\nJohn Doyle: Thank you. Mike, do you have a follow-up?\nMichael Zaremski: Yeah, a quick follow-up. And I know you gave a lot of commentary on kind of commercial primary insurance pricing power, you told us the Marsh Index declined a bit. Just curious if you can offer any more context. 1% kind of feels like a soft market number. What is it -- are you seeing just returns on behalf of your career partners being kind of excellent that's kind of driving the pricing power downwards in light of kind of what still seems like inflationary trends, or just any more color there on kind of what's causing the decel? I know you gave us by-line commentary. So, I don't know if there's a lot more to add.\nJohn Doyle: Yeah. Mike, I would say that, it doesn't feel like a soft market to our clients after five years of price increases. And as I noted, our index skews to larger accounts and where there's a bit more volatility, typically, throughout the cycle. I expect cycles to be shorter and narrower than what they've been in the past, right? There's better data, better technology on the underwriting front. Capital moves so much more quickly in and out. That's part of the E&S market dynamic that you all have observed over the course of the last several years. So, I expect kind of more relative stability. And from time to time, of course, certain areas of risk, things will change in some meaningful way and that will maybe bounce a particular product outside of a normal cycle. Insurer and reinsurer underwriting results have improved in the aggregate over the course of the last couple of years. And I think most feel good about how their book -- how their portfolios are positioned. It's not all one result, of course. We saw some reserve additions in the fourth quarter results overall. And as I mentioned on our call in the first quarter, the great unknown is casualty loss costs, right? There's lots of emerging data that's troubling for our entire ecosystem, for our client, and it contributes to that rising cost of risk that I mentioned earlier. I maybe should also point out, and Dean touched on this a little bit that our index adjusts for limit, exposure, attachment point, and it includes new business, right? You see some other indices that are out in the market that don't necessarily adjust for all of those factors. And then maybe the last point, Mike, that I would make is that, that number doesn't necessarily correlate directly with what premium growth is in the market, right, because at the end of the day, I mean, it might be at -- you might have less of an increase, you might have certain clients buying more. I think that's most prevalent in the reinsurance market at the moment, but we're seeing that in some cases at Marsh as well, where clients again having adjusted to the new market pricing and new market equilibrium has led to a higher level of demand for coverage from our clients. So, anyway, I hope that's helpful. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions on Marsh and the market environment you're seeing there. And I think the first one maybe ties well to your last comments, John. Are you surprised to see casualty rates only up 3% just given the loss trends? I guess I'd love to hear your views both as the CEO of Marsh but also maybe as a former underwriter.\nJohn Doyle: It's a -- I actually -- it's very, very hard right now. As I mentioned earlier, there's some troubling data points, right? And thrown in the mix of the last several accident years, of course, a couple of years of the impact of the pandemic, right? And so, just on the clients where we help them, larger clients, with big risk management programs that have a level of frequency, it's very, very difficult to project where loss costs are. But as I said, the underwriting community is better than it's ever been. They have better data, better technology. But there, again, are some troubling signs. It's not just increased frequency. It's not just kind of nuclear verdicts, that term gets kind of thrown around or even some of the bigger settlements. There's a frequency of larger events. See the Francis Scott Key Bridge as an example, that will be a big loss in the market, maybe not as much a casualty loss, but a big loss in the market. But even in like commercial auto, and you've certainly seen that play out in the personal lines auto market, just kind of more frequency type events just costing more to get resolved. And so, we're putting our efforts to helping our clients think through how to better run off liabilities that they assume and even transfer into the market. And the insurers are investing quite a bit in their claims capabilities as well to try to get ahead of this. But I think we're all pointing to again some flashing yellow signals out there about the rising costs overall. Do you have a follow-up?\nYaron Kinar: Yes, I do. And thanks for the color there. So, in Marsh, organic, obviously, was strong and then we certainly saw a very nice result in US and Canada. I guess the only place I could maybe poke a little bit if I were to try would be Asia Pacific where we saw a step down. Is that -- is there a timing issue there with some one-offs? I know you had a very, very strong 1Q '23 there. But anything you could point to in terms of the organic results in Asia Pacific would be helpful.\nJohn Doyle: Yeah, I don't -- no one-offs or major issues there, just on top of a couple of years of very, very good comps and strong growth. We love how we're positioned in Asia, big protection gaps throughout Asia. We have really strong country -- in-country operations all throughout the region. So, we're not just a regional center. We're in-country and working very, very closely with our clients there. As we've said to you in the past, I wouldn't look at any one particular quarter. And again, it's on top of what's been some outstanding growth in Asia over the last couple of years. So, we feel good about where we're headed in Asia overall. Andrew, next question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks. I was hoping to discuss the competitive environment in RIS maybe from two perspectives. First, I'm wondering whether there is a difference in the market share gain potential when you're in a rising rate environment and the enormously fragmented brokerage world includes a lot of companies that just don't have the resources to help clients manage higher insurance costs as successfully as a company with Marsh's resources. How much of a difference does that make?\nJohn Doyle: It's a good question, Meyer. We're very, very focused on trying to bring scale benefits to our -- well, to all of our key stakeholders, right, including our colleagues, right? We want them -- when they work here, we want them to feel like they have nearly 90,000 folks helping support them with learning and development, data and analytics, market access that you might not have, should you choose to work somewhere else in our industry. So, we certainly think about it from the colleague perspective, we think about it from the client perspective, and we think about it from an investor point of view as well. What I would say, from a client perspective, broadly speaking, again, and this is maybe a bit more upmarket than some of the fragmented segments that you talked about before. Our clients are more risk aware than they've been in the past. I think we have had a role to play in that in trying to make them more risk aware of some meta risks. And again, recent events have certainly helped heighten that. But it's incumbent upon us to bring those scale benefits to the market. And not just scale benefits in terms of data analytics or market access, but different types of solutions. I mentioned earlier, our captive business. We're the largest captive manager in the world, and that's been a meaningful outlet for our clients to manage risk and the rising rate environment over the course of the last several years. So, yes, scale matters. I would also tell you that it plays a role for some of the sellers in the market as well as we talk through with potential M&A targets, why they may look to sell at the moment at times. It's regarding scale type -- scaled-up-type capabilities that we have that are difficult for them to replicate. And so, as I said earlier, we're looking for well led businesses with really solid growth fundamentals, but we know we can make them better too. And that's the exciting part for us. Do you have a follow-up?\nMeyer Shields: I do, but I want to thank you for that. That was very thorough. When we look at the parts of the brokerage market that are more concentrated here, I guess I'm thinking reinsurance or Fortune 100-type accounts, in your view, is the competitive -- are competitors fighting at full strength? Are they all -- is competition right now as intense as it normally is, or any differences from longer-term norms?\nJohn Doyle: No, it's -- I mean, in both of the segments you mentioned, it is a highly competitive market, and we love competition. There's nothing that gets me more fired up than getting out in front of clients and, of course, winning ultimately. And our team is the same way. We're passionate about the value that we try to deliver to our clients. And so, as I mentioned earlier, we're collaborating more than ever. And in those particular segments you mentioned, I think it's been particularly meaningful over the course of the last year or so, our efforts to bring a broader set of capabilities to that client set. But no, it's a very, very competitive market and we welcome it. It makes us better. Thanks, Meyer. Andrew, next question? And maybe the last one.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks. In the prepared remarks, there were some comments on healthcare costs continuing to rise. I was hoping you guys could talk about what you're seeing there and maybe parts of the business, maybe between brokerage and consulting that are generating the strongest organic growth in that 10% organic in health.\nJohn Doyle: Sure. Thank you, Robert. Healthcare and the healthcare industry is a big part of our business overall. And I don't think it's any secret that medical inflation and healthcare-related cost inflation is a major pressure point for our clients in many markets really around the world. It's been a big driver of growth for us, and we continue to invest in it. I talked about in my prepared remarks some of the collaboration between Marsh and Mercer to try to bring some sort of relief to an angle of cost pressure in that marketplace. But Pat, maybe you could talk about the growth we're seeing and some of the cost inflation as well.\nPat Tomlinson: Sure. So, the way that healthcare inflation impacts the business varies based upon the area of the world that we're in. In certain areas of the world where predominantly fee based, it's more large market that would predominantly be from a Mercer perspective inside like the US and some of our more mature larger markets. And then, in a lot of the markets, we are a little bit more brokerage-based to where it's based that way. But let me be clear, even the spots where we're fixed fee, healthcare inflation drives significant increased cost to clients. So, it does create a lot of -- it creates demand for work for us, a lot of project work. So, we will see projects out of that healthcare inflation, it's not necessarily directly driven that way. And even if there's healthcare inflation in the other areas where it's brokerage, it's not a linear type activity from a commission perspective because we're -- once that cost is flowing through to the client P&L, we're always out there doing plan redesign for a client to help make sure that that full cost of healthcare inflation is not flowing through their P&L, right, because they really don't control -- that's one of the larger costs that they don't control themselves based upon the activity that they've had. So that's really where a lot of the inflation helps us. Part of it is increased activity and project work. Occasionally it does create higher rates that flows through in brokerage, but many times those higher rates, we're still doing plan design with the client to try and mitigate the impact that is going to have on the client P&L even in a spot where it's straight commission based brokerage, we're trying to mitigate those costs.\nJohn Doyle: So, rising health and benefit costs in a tight labor market, again, is a pressure point. And another example of where, again, we can bring scale and a broader set of capabilities to the market that our clients appreciate. Do you have a follow-up, Robert?\nRobert Cox: Yeah, very helpful. Thank you. Maybe just last question. On the wealth segment, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think last year, probably, the pension business was growing stronger than your investment business. Did that occur as well in the first quarter here or were both of them kind of similar to the 5% organic growth that was achieved in well?\nJohn Doyle: Yeah, we had good solid growth across investment management and defined benefits. As Pat mentioned, our DB business and this period of elevated interest rates have seen a bit more growth than we expected over the course of the last couple of years, but good growth in our OCIO business and our broader set of consulting capabilities inside of our investment business. So, yes, we felt good about that. Thank you, Robert. Andrew?\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh & McLennan, for any closing remarks.\nJohn Doyle: All right. Thank you, Andrew. And I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dean Klisura",
            "content": "Yeah. Thanks, John. And Jimmy, I'll give you a little bit more color on the April 1 reinsurance renewal, that would be helpful. As John noted, we saw a continuation of market conditions that we experienced at January 1. And as John noted, market conditions are stable, but we're definitely seeing increased client demand to provide additional property cat limit, particularly at the top end of programs. That was very pronounced throughout the first quarter at 1/1 through the quarter. And certainly that trend continued on April 1. Strong capital inflows into the reinsurance market, driven by strong reinsurer returns, double-digit returns in 2023. We talked about last quarter on the call, reinsurer appetite has increased for property cat. There is an inflow of capital and capacity. Competition at the top end of programs, it's been good for both buyers and sellers in the marketplace. Specifically to property cat, in the US, at April 1, as I said, capacity was strong. As John noted, the market was generally flat to down incrementally for clients without cat losses. Accounts with cat losses saw 10% to 20% kind of rate increases. But keep in mind, we give you rate-adjusted figures. But when you factor in inflation, exposure growth, value growth, premiums on these cat programs are still increasing year-over-year. It continues to be a tailwind for Guy Carpenter in the marketplace. And as I said, there's a lot of competition for cat business. US casualty, as John noted, was challenging, just as challenging on April 1 as it was at the January 1 renewal. Reinsurers are exerting pressure on pricing in terms and conditions. Ceding commissions are facing downward pressure from reinsurers on certain quota-share contracts, particularly financial lines, which Martin has talked about in the past. Excess-of-loss contracts are seeing rate increases across the board, in some cases, double-digit. However, there was adequate casualty capacity in the marketplace at April 1, and all of the programs that we placed got completed in full. But I would balance that against continued reinsurer concern with the adverse development, driven by social inflation and increasing loss cost trends. I think that's a good summary of where we were in the US market. Just a note on Japan. Big April 1 cat date in Japan, a very orderly market, sufficient capacity, many cat programs were oversubscribed. We didn't observe any structural changes. Attachment points stayed where they were from a year ago. And again, it was a market that was down on average 5% from a rating perspective, and we didn't really observe any rate impact from the January earthquake in Japan. Overall, a very orderly market at April 1 in Japan."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Pat Tomlinson",
            "content": "Sure. Thanks, John. Yes, we are pleased with our Q1 2024 underlying growth, as mentioned earlier, of 6%. It was our 12th consecutive quarter with 5% or more growth, especially the breadth across the practices. Health, another impressive quarter with 10% growth in Q1. That growth was really [Technical Difficulty] double-digit growth nearly across all regions. And it comes on the back of investments in hiring new talent, focus on thought leadership, creating digital tools and really focusing in on client segmentation, trying to match client healthcare needs, based upon industry segment size with the innovative and adaptive solutions that we have. So, really trying to meet clients where they are. We certainly benefited from strong retention. We had good renewal growth. Insurer revenue and medical cost inflation has an impact there. We see significant demand for digital solutions and the innovative benefits that are kind of underscoring the value that we're providing to clients. If I pivot over to wealth, we grew 5% in Q1. There was good, balanced, equally strong performance in [DB&A] (ph) and IMS. We see DB plans funding statuses continue to benefit from elevated interest rates that's driving an increase in risk transfer over the last couple of years, as well as we have some regulatory requirements and demands that are creating some project work. If you add in some capital -- some volatile capital markets, it's driving strong demand for both our actuarial and our investment solutions business. Speaking of investment solutions, in OCIO, we benefited from some transactions in Westpac and Vanguard, Mark mentioned that earlier, but also good net new inflows and capital markets provided us some revenue lift in Q1. From a career perspective, growth was muted to 1% for the quarter, but we're following a period of strong growth over the past several years, including a challenging 12% comparable last year. The growth was strong in international, is very broad across all practices and regions. We did see, as was mentioned, some softness in US career, specifically in rewards in the transformation space, as I would say, clients are starting to navigate some of the macro conditions, right? So, let me highlight the career practices coming off that very long period of high growth. As I mentioned, double-digits in -- for the past eight quarters, driven in large part, I would say, by inflation and employee attrition. If we all remember the great resignation back coming out of the pandemic, which drove a lot of labor shortages and really created a lot of demand for projects with clients as they were trying to think about the rewards and how to pay people to keep them retained, the skills that they might need if they had to pivot, because they didn't have the right resources, and also starting to think about transformation as they were having less resources to work with, and there was innovation in technology, as we've all talked about AI, in the past and helping clients through those. So certainly, I think from that perspective, we feel good that there's good breadth of our solutions and demand in the market as we go ahead and fill those needs. John quickly asked me to talk a little bit about how I think about the business and the priorities too. So, obviously, my first call. On April 1, I got to step in and begin this opportunity of a lifetime leading Mercer and our 21,000 colleagues from around the world, as we are focused on creating brighter futures for our clients and for their people. I am extremely humbled and honored to be the CEO of this fantastic firm. And personally, I really want to thank Martine Ferland for a very smooth transition and for the growth momentum and culture that she helped create here. Priority-wise, I want to accelerate that momentum. From the impact that we're having to clients to the fantastic careers we build for colleagues here, the collaboration amongst our colleagues across Marsh McLennan, we can leverage new technologies, and we perform really purpose-driven work, and can have a positive impact on our communities as well. I think we're very well-positioned, as we've been repositioning ourselves over the last several years, reshaping our portfolio. Mark mentioned the divestitures. We've been divesting admin practices. We've been building capabilities and reach and global benefits in OCIO. We've been accelerating acquisitions and we're really just creating more value for clients at scale. And that's what we've been focused in on. So, I'm very optimistic about our future. Sure. So, the way that healthcare inflation impacts the business varies based upon the area of the world that we're in. In certain areas of the world where predominantly fee based, it's more large market that would predominantly be from a Mercer perspective inside like the US and some of our more mature larger markets. And then, in a lot of the markets, we are a little bit more brokerage-based to where it's based that way. But let me be clear, even the spots where we're fixed fee, healthcare inflation drives significant increased cost to clients. So, it does create a lot of -- it creates demand for work for us, a lot of project work. So, we will see projects out of that healthcare inflation, it's not necessarily directly driven that way.

            "name": "John Doyle",
            "content": "Good morning. Thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter results reported earlier today. I'm John Doyle, President and CEO of Marsh McLennan. On the call with me is Mark McGivney, our CFO, and the CEOs of our businesses: Martin South of Marsh; Dean Klisura of Guy Carpenter; Nick Studer of Oliver Wyman; and Pat Tomlinson of Mercer, who is joining us -- joining this call for the first time. Welcome, Pat. Also with us today is Sarah DeWitt, Head of Investor Relations. Marsh McLennan had a strong start to 2024. Our first quarter results were excellent, and we are well-positioned for another good year. Top-line [Technical Difficulty] continued with 9% underlying revenue growth, which was on top of 9% growth in the first quarter of last year. All of our businesses had strong revenue growth with Marsh, Mercer and Oliver Wyman accelerating growth from the fourth quarter. We grew adjusted operating income by 11% from a year ago. Our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2023. We had adjusted EPS growth of 14%. And we completed $300 million of share repurchases in the quarter. In addition, we continue to add to our talent, capabilities and scale through acquisitions. These investments will help strengthen our strategic position and sustain top-line growth. For example, Mercer completed the purchase of Vanguard's OCIO business, which expands our reach into the endowments and foundation segment. MMA acquired two leading agencies in Louisiana, and Oliver Wyman closed the acquisition of SeaTec, which extends our capabilities in the aviation, transportation and defense industries. At Marsh McLennan, we bring together specialized capabilities and perspectives across risk, strategy and people to help clients make critical decisions with confidence. For example, in the area of supply chain risk, we developed a solution called [Centrisk] (ph), which draws on the perspective and capabilities of Marsh and Oliver Wyman to identify key risks in our client supply chains. Using this framework, we create a digital twin model of a client supply lines, which provides for a scenario-based vulnerability assessment to help manage risk. This product is already helping clients across multiple sectors, including in the banking, manufacturing, aviation and defense industries. As we noted last quarter, Marsh, Oliver Wyman and Guy Carpenter developed the Unity facility, a public-private insurance solution that enables grain shipments from Ukrainian ports. In the first quarter, we worked with the Ukrainian government, DZ Bank, Lloyd's and others to expand the facility to all ships carrying non-military cargo. This will help support Ukraine's economic resilience in time of war. In the healthcare sector, Marsh and Mercer are working together to help clients evaluate connections between talent retention, patient safety and the cost of malpractice insurance. Marsh's risk assessment capabilities and Mercer's extensive health and human capital expertise, combined with our rich datasets, are creating new, highly-valued perspectives in the healthcare sector. These are just a few examples of how we're applying our unique expertise to address pressing challenges and deliver significant value to clients. Recently, we released our Annual ESG Report. The report includes enhanced disclosure on our ESG efforts and underscores how the actions we're taking [Technical Difficulty] and on behalf of our clients also have a positive impact on the communities where we live and work. Let me share some examples. We collaborated with the Center for NYC Neighborhoods to launch a community-based catastrophe insurance program. This parametric insurance program helps finance emergency grants to community members following an event, with funds reaching households within days of a catastrophe. In cyber, we developed a global personal microinsurance solution to protect against threats like online identity theft, viruses, cyber-bullying and failure to deliver purchased goods. With regard to sustainability, we are supporting the Dubai Energy and Water Authority's commitment to provide 100% of its energy from clean sources by 2050. As part of this work, we conducted a client -- a climate resilience assessment of one of the world's largest solar parks. We modeled the site's ability to withstand future climate conditions and proposed adaptation measures to mitigate extreme risks. We continue to improve sustainability in our own operations as well. For example, in 2023, we expanded the use of renewable electricity across our US offices and in our largest UK locations. And we submitted our climate targets for validation as part of our goal to achieve net zero globally by 2050. We remain committed to generating exceptional financial performance and returns for shareholders, and we also recognize that the successful outcomes we help enable for our clients and our own actions can have a lasting positive effect on communities around the world. Shifting to the macro picture, we see significant opportunity to help clients navigate the range of outcomes driven by a more complex environment. The geopolitical backdrop remains unsettled with multiple major wars and rising tensions globally. More than half the world's population will go to elections in 2024, and the economic outlook remains uncertain as well. Despite this uncertainty, the environment is supportive of growth in our business. In general, we see continued economic growth in most of our major markets, inflation and interest rates remain elevated, labor markets are tight, the cost of risk is up, and healthcare costs continue to rise. We have a strong record of performance across economic cycles due to the resilience of our business and demand for our advice and solutions. Turning to insurance and reinsurance market conditions, primary insurance rates increased, with the Marsh Global Insurance Market Index up 1% overall in the quarter. Property rates increased 3% versus 6% in the fourth quarter. Casualty was up 3%, in line with last quarter. Workers' compensation decreased mid-single digits while financial and professional liability rates were down 7%, and cyber pricing decreased 6%. Reinsurance market conditions remained stable, with increased client demand and adequate capacity. In the April renewal period, US property cat reinsurance rates were flat with some decreases for accounts without losses. Loss-impacted accounts averaged increases in the 10% to 20% range. The US casualty reinsurance market was challenging, but rates were in line with January renewals. In January, April 1 property cat rates overall were down slightly on a risk-adjusted basis. Early signs for June 1 Florida cat risk renewals point to improved market conditions for cedents. Increased reinsurance appetite for growth should be adequate to meet higher demand. As always, we are helping our clients navigate these dynamic market conditions. Now, let me turn briefly to our first quarter financial performance, which Mark will cover in detail. We generated adjusted EPS of $2.89, which is up 14% versus a year ago. Revenue grew 9% on an underlying basis with 9% growth in both RIS and in consulting. Marsh was up 8%, Guy Carpenter grew 8%, Mercer 6%, and Oliver Wyman was up 13%. Overall, in the first quarter, we had adjusted operating income growth of 11%, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points year-over-year. Turning to our outlook, we are very well-positioned for another good year in 2024. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying revenue growth, another year of margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. Our outlook assumes current macro conditions persist. However, meaningful uncertainty remains and the economic backdrop could be materially different than our assumptions. In summary, the first quarter was a great start to the year for Marsh McLennan. Our business delivered strong performance and we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives. I'm proud of the focus and determination of our colleagues and the value they deliver to our clients and shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for a more detailed review of our results. Thank you, Mark. Andrew, we are ready to begin Q&A. Thanks, David, for the question, and good morning. We work very hard not to be an index on P&C pricing, right? It's an element. It's a macro factor that obviously does have some impact. But less than half of Marsh's revenue is exposed to P&C pricing. What I would also say to you is that where we're most exposed to commission is in the middle-market. Our index skews to larger account data. Pricing is up a bit more in the middle-market than it is in the large account segment, and typically is less cyclical than what you see in the large account market. But I want to just talk about growth overall. I was very pleased with the start to the year, 9% on top of 9% last year and accelerated growth from the fourth quarter of 7%, as I mentioned. Marsh, Mercer and Oliver Wyman all had accelerated growth from the fourth quarter. The macros continue to be supportive, David. Solid GDP growth in most major markets, although it's under a bit of pressure. Inflation and interest rates remain elevated. There's tight labor markets, as I said before, rising healthcare cost. The overall cost of risk continues to increase. And demand remains very strong. Not long out of the pandemic, of course, we've got a couple of global wars happening, supply chain stress. Our clients are showing broader risk awareness. We're talking to them about that and really trying to help them find better balance between resilience and efficiency. And we continue to invest through this cycle, right? I talked about a couple of the acquisitions we did. We're improving our mix of business as well. We sold some admin businesses at Mercer in the quarter. And I'm very, very pleased with how our colleagues are executing, too. We've been working on our client engagement model and improving that, continue to invest in sales operations. And as I've talked about, over the course of the last year, we're collaborating more than ever. It starts with the talent that we have. We have the best talent in the markets that we operate in. We're, of course, not immune to macros, including pricing on some level, but we're a resilient business and we're quite excited about 2024. Do you have a follow-up? Sure, yeah. Marsh in the US got off to a terrific start, US and Canada, I would point out. And Martin, maybe you could give David a little bit more color. Thanks, Martin. David, I would add, it wasn't a bang-out quarter in terms of M&A activity in our transaction risk business, but it's a smaller part of our -- smaller part of our business now. It's a little feedback there. It's a smaller part of our business after the slowdown. So, the impact was less. But we did see some volume in M&A activity pick up during the quarter, which of course is encouraging. So, thank you for your questions. Andrew, next question, please. Sure, Jimmy. Thanks for the question. Maybe I'll elaborate a little bit on some of my prepared remarks and then ask Dean to talk a bit about the reinsurance market. But I think both markets continue to stabilize on average in the quarter. And again, I would remind everyone it's a collection of markets, not a single market. That stabilization is good for our clients. And in some cases, a better market has led to increased demand in both insurance and reinsurance. I would also point out that in recent years, we've had higher premium growth in the captives that we manage at Marsh compared to the premium flow into the traditional market. That may change a bit now, we'll see as markets stabilize and our clients can adjust to what the market looks like going forward. I mentioned earlier our index skews to major accounts. So, pricing in the middle-market continues to move up a bit more than the data points I mentioned earlier. But I would also say that insurers and reinsurers are cautious about that rising cost-of-risk environment that I mentioned as well. And so, while again, a stabilizing market is better for our clients overall, I don't expect that relative stability to change anytime soon given some of the rising cost of risk issues that the insurance community is confronting. So, Dean, maybe you can talk a little bit more about what's happening in reinsurance. Terrific, Dean. Thank you. Jimmy, do you have a follow-up? Mark, you want to jump on that one? Thank you, Mark. And thank you, Jimmy. Andrew, next question, please. Good morning, Elyse. We expect again good margin expansion in 2024. As you pointed out, Mark noted, we expect the second half to be better than the first half. We have some expected headwinds, not really seasonality, but really driven from a higher [merit pool] (ph) a year ago, some acquisition-related costs, and some higher reimbursable expenses. But I want to remind everybody not to focus on any one particular quarter. Again, margin is an outcome of really how we run the business, and it's not a primary objective of ours. Again, having said that, we see opportunity for margin improvement, continued margin improvement. But we're going to continue to make attractive investments to support the medium to long-term growth of the business. We have a number of different efforts underway, ongoing workflow and automation efforts at Marsh, Mercer and Guy Carpenter. And we continue to press for opportunities to improve efficiency at the intersections of our businesses as well. So, we see opportunity. And as we pointed out, we expect the second half to be better than the first. Do you have a follow-up, Elyse? So, let me be clear, Elyse, we're not looking to build a third-party wholesale business. There's obviously been considerable growth in the wholesaler to E&S market over the course of the last several years. We want to bring the best solutions in the marketplace to our clients. Generally, we're preferring admitted solutions for our clients. Not that there aren't good things that happen in the E&S market. Of course, there are, and innovation is one of the areas where the E&S market is important. But we want to access as much of that E&S market directly. We actually access most of our E&S market solutions directly today. But we want to continue to press and make sure that we can access as much of that market directly. So, it's client-driven, It's about us managing the client outcomes, client experiences, really as directly as possible. Having said that, we'll continue to use wholesalers for niche expertise. They serve us very well and our clients very well. In those cases, they also have strong program businesses as well. So, anyway, that's what it's about. It's just, again, making sure we can directly access as much capital directly as possible for our clients. Thank you for that. Andrew, next question? Okay. Thanks, Greg. Yeah, we are very pleased with the start to the year. As you recall, of course, Oliver Wyman had a slow start to the year in 2023, had a nice year overall of growth. There's going to be a bit more volatility to revenue growth at Oliver Wyman, but we also expect better growth on average from Oliver Wyman over the medium to longer term. Nick, maybe you can share with Greg some color on demand in the first quarter. Thank you, Nick. That's very helpful. And Greg, maybe I'll ask Pat Tomlinson also to share some thoughts just on the first quarter at Mercer, given our consulting operations there. And Pat, while you have the floor, as I mentioned, obviously, you're joining this call for the first time. Maybe you could talk a bit about your priorities at Mercer. Thank you, Pat. We're excited to have you at this table. Greg, do you have a follow-up? Yeah. Thanks, Greg. What I would say is we remain quite active in the market. There's a good -- we have a good strong pipeline, as I've talked about in the past, we have an excellent reputation in that marketplace as being a good owner as well. So, we're excited about the deals we did in the first quarter. And again, we're going to continue to remain active in the market. I think valuations have remained stubbornly high, I would say, on the other side of things. And while we might expect that for top-quality assets, I would also point out that some lesser-quality assets have traded at some very, very high multiples of late. And so, we're going to be picky. We're looking for well-led businesses with real strong growth fundamentals that make us better and are a good cultural fit for our organization. We've been very successful at it. And again, as Mark pointed out, we expect to continue to deploy capital in the market going forward. Thank you, Greg. Andrew, next question, please. Thanks, Mike. Mark, you want to... Thank you. Mike, do you have a follow-up? Yeah. Mike, I would say that, it doesn't feel like a soft market to our clients after five years of price increases. And as I noted, our index skews to larger accounts and where there's a bit more volatility, typically, throughout the cycle. I expect cycles to be shorter and narrower than what they've been in the past, right? There's better data, better technology on the underwriting front. Capital moves so much more quickly in and out. That's part of the E&S market dynamic that you all have observed over the course of the last several years. So, I expect kind of more relative stability. And from time to time, of course, certain areas of risk, things will change in some meaningful way and that will maybe bounce a particular product outside of a normal cycle. Insurer and reinsurer underwriting results have improved in the aggregate over the course of the last couple of years. And I think most feel good about how their book -- how their portfolios are positioned. It's not all one result, of course. We saw some reserve additions in the fourth quarter results overall. And as I mentioned on our call in the first quarter, the great unknown is casualty loss costs, right? There's lots of emerging data that's troubling for our entire ecosystem, for our client, and it contributes to that rising cost of risk that I mentioned earlier. I maybe should also point out, and Dean touched on this a little bit that our index adjusts for limit, exposure, attachment point, and it includes new business, right? You see some other indices that are out in the market that don't necessarily adjust for all of those factors. And then maybe the last point, Mike, that I would make is that, that number doesn't necessarily correlate directly with what premium growth is in the market, right, because at the end of the day, I mean, it might be at -- you might have less of an increase, you might have certain clients buying more. I think that's most prevalent in the reinsurance market at the moment, but we're seeing that in some cases at Marsh as well, where clients again having adjusted to the new market pricing and new market equilibrium has led to a higher level of demand for coverage from our clients. So, anyway, I hope that's helpful. Andrew, next question, please. It's a -- I actually -- it's very, very hard right now. As I mentioned earlier, there's some troubling data points, right? And thrown in the mix of the last several accident years, of course, a couple of years of the impact of the pandemic, right? And so, just on the clients where we help them, larger clients, with big risk management programs that have a level of frequency, it's very, very difficult to project where loss costs are. But as I said, the underwriting community is better than it's ever been. They have better data, better technology. But there, again, are some troubling signs. It's not just increased frequency. It's not just kind of nuclear verdicts, that term gets kind of thrown around or even some of the bigger settlements. There's a frequency of larger events. See the Francis Scott Key Bridge as an example, that will be a big loss in the market, maybe not as much a casualty loss, but a big loss in the market. But even in like commercial auto, and you've certainly seen that play out in the personal lines auto market, just kind of more frequency type events just costing more to get resolved. And so, we're putting our efforts to helping our clients think through how to better run off liabilities that they assume and even transfer into the market. And the insurers are investing quite a bit in their claims capabilities as well to try to get ahead of this. But I think we're all pointing to again some flashing yellow signals out there about the rising costs overall. Do you have a follow-up? Yeah, I don't -- no one-offs or major issues there, just on top of a couple of years of very, very good comps and strong growth. We love how we're positioned in Asia, big protection gaps throughout Asia. We have really strong country -- in-country operations all throughout the region. So, we're not just a regional center. We're in-country and working very, very closely with our clients there. As we've said to you in the past, I wouldn't look at any one particular quarter. And again, it's on top of what's been some outstanding growth in Asia over the last couple of years. So, we feel good about where we're headed in Asia overall. Andrew, next question, please. It's a good question, Meyer. We're very, very focused on trying to bring scale benefits to our -- well, to all of our key stakeholders, right, including our colleagues, right? We want them -- when they work here, we want them to feel like they have nearly 90,000 folks helping support them with learning and development, data and analytics, market access that you might not have, should you choose to work somewhere else in our industry. So, we certainly think about it from the colleague perspective, we think about it from the client perspective, and we think about it from an investor point of view as well. What I would say, from a client perspective, broadly speaking, again, and this is maybe a bit more upmarket than some of the fragmented segments that you talked about before. Our clients are more risk aware than they've been in the past. I think we have had a role to play in that in trying to make them more risk aware of some meta risks. And again, recent events have certainly helped heighten that. But it's incumbent upon us to bring those scale benefits to the market. And not just scale benefits in terms of data analytics or market access, but different types of solutions. I mentioned earlier, our captive business. We're the largest captive manager in the world, and that's been a meaningful outlet for our clients to manage risk and the rising rate environment over the course of the last several years. So, yes, scale matters. I would also tell you that it plays a role for some of the sellers in the market as well as we talk through with potential M&A targets, why they may look to sell at the moment at times. It's regarding scale type -- scaled-up-type capabilities that we have that are difficult for them to replicate. And so, as I said earlier, we're looking for well led businesses with really solid growth fundamentals, but we know we can make them better too. And that's the exciting part for us. Do you have a follow-up? No, it's -- I mean, in both of the segments you mentioned, it is a highly competitive market, and we love competition. There's nothing that gets me more fired up than getting out in front of clients and, of course, winning ultimately. And our team is the same way. We're passionate about the value that we try to deliver to our clients. And so, as I mentioned earlier, we're collaborating more than ever. And in those particular segments you mentioned, I think it's been particularly meaningful over the course of the last year or so, our efforts to bring a broader set of capabilities to that client set. But no, it's a very, very competitive market and we welcome it. It makes us better. Thanks, Meyer. Andrew, next question? And maybe the last one. Sure. Thank you, Robert. Healthcare and the healthcare industry is a big part of our business overall. And I don't think it's any secret that medical inflation and healthcare-related cost inflation is a major pressure point for our clients in many markets really around the world. It's been a big driver of growth for us, and we continue to invest in it. I talked about in my prepared remarks some of the collaboration between Marsh and Mercer to try to bring some sort of relief to an angle of cost pressure in that marketplace. But Pat, maybe you could talk about the growth we're seeing and some of the cost inflation as well. So, rising health and benefit costs in a tight labor market, again, is a pressure point. And another example of where, again, we can bring scale and a broader set of capabilities to the market that our clients appreciate. Do you have a follow-up, Robert? Yeah, we had good solid growth across investment management and defined benefits. As Pat mentioned, our DB business and this period of elevated interest rates have seen a bit more growth than we expected over the course of the last couple of years, but good growth in our OCIO business and our broader set of consulting capabilities inside of our investment business. So, yes, we felt good about that. Thank you, Robert. Andrew? All right. Thank you, Andrew. And I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call this morning. In closing, I want to thank our colleagues for their hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our clients for their continued support. Thank you all very much, and I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, John, and thank you, Greg. Yeah, 13% was a very pleasing start to the year, it makes a marvelous headline, and we're very, very proud of a good start on what, as you noted, is a tough environment for many in our profession. John has already given the caution about taking the two-year view. We also probably benefited from a few little timing benefits of things that might have shown up in Q2, might have shown up in Q1. And we still very much give guidance through the cycle. This should be a mid-to-high single-digit business. And you noted the sort of forecasting it out is a tricky challenge. That is true because we have a relatively short backlog. The nature of our work is such that when clients need assistance, they need it quickly. And so, we are always ready to move very, very nimbly. To give you a little bit more color, we grew pretty strongly across all the four regions of our management consulting business and our economic research business, NERA, also grew very strongly, fastest in the Middle East, but in the double-digits or very close to double-digits in all three of the other major regions we have. And sectorally, it was also fairly broadly spread. Our communications media and technology team grew well, healthcare grew well, banking seeing a rebound in private capital work, which I've noted on previous calls, has been pretty robust even in the face of obviously a very much lower deal market, but our work on portfolio company performance has helped us there. But insurance also growing, and quite broadly across the capabilities that we bring to bear as well. So, we think we're in a good position. We're very confident we gained share over the last few years, but it's a tough consulting environment. And our pipeline indicates that mid-to-high single-digit growth environment, growth forecast, is how we think about this business through the cycle."

            "content": "Yeah. It wasn't just the US and Canada, it was great balanced growth across the business. But I'll dig into the US a little bit and give you some color on some of the drivers of growth there. And it's really been a product of a lot of work in the last few years to get where we are. So, the overall growth of 8%, our businesses -- the mid-market business, MMA, had a terrific start to the year. The growth in that business is driven both by renewal and fantastic new business. Victor, our MGA business, rebounded, has a great performance, very strong performance in Canada. [Just they] (ph) had a tough year last year, it bounced back and the core business in the US grew nicely. So, very good. The drivers really, particularly in the specialty areas, construction was very strong in the first quarter. Our MMB business was strong. Our advisory business in the US was very strong as part of the risk advisor of the future to the tip of the spear and makes our relationship much stickier. So, our renewal growth was good. And our loss business rate was down. So, we feel very good about all the areas that we've been focusing on, about client relationship, specialization, industry focus advisory, all these things are the drivers for growth. So, we feel very good about things."

            "name": "Mark McGivney",
            "content": "Thank you, John, and good morning. Our first quarter results were outstanding and represent an excellent start to the year. We saw continued momentum in underlying growth, strong margin expansion, double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Our consolidated revenue increased 9% in the first quarter to $6.5 billion, underlying growth of 9%. Operating income was $1.9 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 11% to $2 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 80 basis points to 32%, and we expect higher margin expansion for the rest of the year, particularly in the second half. GAAP EPS was $2.82, and adjusted EPS was $2.89, up 14% [Technical Difficulty] last year. Looking at Risk and Insurance Services, first quarter revenue was $4.3 billion, up 9% compared with a year ago on both a reported and underlying basis. This result marks the 12th consecutive quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth in RIS and continues the best stretch of growth in two decades. RIS operating income was $1.6 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income was also $1.6 billion, up 11% over last year, and our adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 39.1%. At Marsh, revenue in the quarter increased 9% to $3 billion or 8% on an underlying basis. This comes on top of 9% growth in the first quarter of last year. In US and Canada, underlying growth was 8% for the quarter, reflecting solid renewal and new business growth. In international, underlying growth was strong at 8% and comes on top of 10% in the first quarter last year. EMEA was up 9%, Latin America grew 8%, and Asia-Pacific was up 6%. Guy Carpenter's revenue was $1.1 billion, up 7%, or 8% on an underlying basis, driven by growth across most regions and Global Specialties. This was the fifth straight quarter of 8% or higher underlying growth at Guy Carpenter. In the Consulting segment, first quarter revenue was $2.2 billion, up 9% on an underlying basis. Consulting operating income was $432 million, and adjusted operating income was $444 million, up 9%. Our adjusted operating margin in Consulting was 20.7% in the first quarter, an increase of 40 basis points. Mercer's revenue was $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 6% on an underlying basis. This was Mercer's 12th straight quarter of 5% or higher underlying growth and continues the best run of growth in 15 years. Health underlying growth was 10% and reflected strong momentum across all regions. Wealth grew 5%, driven by growth in both investment management and DB Consulting. Our assets under management were $489 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 17% sequentially and up 38% compared to the first quarter of last year. Year-over-year growth was driven by our transactions with Westpac and Vanguard, rebounding capital markets and positive net flows. Career revenue increased 1%, reflecting a tough comparison to a period of strong growth last year, as well as softness in the US. Oliver Wyman's revenue in the first quarter was $789 million, up 13% on an underlying basis from the slow start we had in the first quarter of last year, and reflected strength across all regions. Foreign exchange had very little impact on earnings in the first quarter. Assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, we expect FX to be a $0.02 headwind in the second quarter and a further $0.01 headwind in the second half. Total noteworthy items in the quarter were $49 million. The majority of these items were restructuring costs, mostly related to the program we began in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our other net benefit credit was $67 million in the quarter. For the full year, we expect our other net benefit credit will be approximately $265 million. Interest expense in the first quarter was $159 million, up from $136 million in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting higher levels of debt and higher interest rates. Based on our current forecast, we expect $158 million of interest expense in the second quarter and approximately $620 million for the full year. Our adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter was 23.9% compared with 25% in the first quarter of last year. Our tax rate benefited from favorable discrete items, the largest of which was the accounting for share-based compensation, similar to a year ago. Excluding discrete items, our adjusted effective tax rate was approximately 26.5%. When we give forward guidance around our tax rate, we do not project discrete items, which can be positive or negative. Based on the current environment, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of between 25.5% and 26.5% for 2024. Turning to capital management and our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total debt of $13.5 billion. Our next scheduled debt maturity is in the second quarter, when $600 million of senior notes mature. Our cash position at the end of the first quarter was $1.5 billion. Uses of cash in the quarter totaled $1 billion, and included $354 million for dividends, $347 million for acquisitions, and $300 million for share repurchases. We continue to expect to deploy approximately $4.5 billion of capital in 2024 across dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The ultimate level of share repurchase will depend on how our M&A pipeline develops. While there continues to be uncertainty in the outlook for the global economy, we feel good about the momentum in our business and the current environment remains supportive of growth. Overall, our strong start leaves us well-positioned for another good year in 2024. Based on our outlook today, for the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit or better underlying growth, margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted EPS. With that, I'm happy to turn it back to John. Yeah. Jimmy, there is a little season, as you pointed out. There is a little -- tends to be a little seasonality in our fiduciary balances. Q1 and Q4 tend to be seasonal lows modestly. So that would explain that. In terms of outlook, we'll see what happens to the rate environment. The interest -- our fiduciary interest income is going to be a function of balances and rates, and we've got about $11.5 billion of balances. So, depending on what you want to assume for the trajectory of rates, the math is pretty straightforward. Yeah, I think it's a great point that you're making and I think it reflects the strategy of the company. We've said we continually invest in positioning ourselves for the future. And over the last several years, we've talked about the heavy investments we've made organically in talent. And so, I think we've done a terrific job of really being thoughtful about all of our other operating expenses, functional costs, how we're leveraging things across the firm, T&E. Really some of the gains we made in the pandemic, we've harvested them. So, as you point out, a lot of our margin expansion over the last five years has come from being really disciplined on things far away from the client and investing heavily in client-facing talent. And so, I think that is a factor in our growth. And I think also as we look forward, there's going to be leverage in those investments, which is why we're optimistic about margins going forward."
