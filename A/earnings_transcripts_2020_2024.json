We look forward to having you join us on December 9. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Ankur, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call today. Today, I want to get straight to our quarterly results, because they tell a very compelling story. The Agilent team delivered a very strong close to 2020. We posted revenues of $1.48 billion during the quarter. Revenues are up 8% on a reported basis, and up 6% core. Operating margins are a healthy 24.9%. EPS of $0.98 is up 10% year-over-year. These numbers tell the story of a strong resilient company that's built for continued growth. Our better than expected results are due to the strength of our core business, along with signs of recovery in our end markets. Geographically, China continues to lead the way with double-digit growth. From an end-market view, both our pharmaceutical and food businesses grew double-digits. In addition, our chemical and energy business grew after two quarters of declines, exceeding our expectations. We also saw a rebound in U.S. sales during the quarter. Overall, COVID-19 tailwinds contributed just over two points of core growth. Achieving these results in the face of a global pandemic is a tribute to our team and the company we've built over the last five years. I couldn't be more pleased with the way the Agilent team has performed over the last quarter and throughout 2020. We have again proven our ability to work together and step up to meet any challenge that comes our way. During the quarter, all three of our business groups grew high single-digits on a reported basis. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $671 million in revenue, up 8% on a reported basis, and up 4% core. LSAG growth is broad-based. The cell analysis and mass spec businesses both grew at double-digit rates. In terms of end markets, chemical and energy returned to growth, food grew double-digits, and pharma high single-digits. LSAG remains extremely well-positioned and is outperforming the market. The Agilent CrossLab Group came in with revenues at $518 million. This is up a reported 9% and up 7% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based across end markets and geographies. Our focus on on-demand service is paying off as activities in our customer's labs continues to increase. The ACG team continues to build on it's already deep connections with our customers, helping them operate through the pandemic, and continue to drive improved efficiencies in lab operations. In the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, revenues were $294 million, up 9% reported, and up 7% core. Growth was broad-based, with NASD oligo manufacturing revenues up roughly 40%. The Genomics and pathology businesses continue to improve during the quarter. I'm also very proud of our NASD team for successfully ramping production at our new Frederick site this year. We have built a very strong position in this attractive market, with excellent long-term prospects for high growth. Let's now shift gears and look at our full-year fiscal 2020 results. Despite the disruption, uncertainty, and economic turmoil dealing with a global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered solid results. We generated $5.34 billion in revenue, up 3% on a reported basis, and up nearly 1% core. To put this in perspective, it's helpful to recall the progression of our growth. In Q1, we delivered 2% core growth, as you saw the first impact of COVID-19 in our business in China. Both Q2 and Q3 declined low single-digits as the pandemic spread across the globe and governments instituted broad shutdowns. With 6% core growth, 8% reported in Q4, we're seeing business and economies start to recover. As a result, we are clearly exiting 2020 with solid momentum. Our recurring types of businesses, represented by ACG and DGG prove resilient, growing low to mid single-digits for the year. In a very tough CapEx market, our LSAG instrument business declined only 2% for the year, and returned to growth in the final quarter. China led the way for our recovery with accelerating growth as the year progressed. In our end markets, pharma remained the most resilient, and food markets recovered most quickly. Full-year earnings per share grew 5% during fiscal 2020, to $3.28. The full-year operating margin of 23.5% is up 20 basis points over fiscal 2019. As we head into 2021 we do so with tremendous advantage. Our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy, with the focus of high growth markets continues to deliver. Our ability to respond quickly to rapidly changing conditions is also serving us well. The way our sales and service teams have been able to quickly pivot to meet customer requirements during the pandemic has been nothing short of remarkable. You know, last year this time, I used this call to remind you of the Agilent shareholder value creation model. Our approach is focused on delivering above market growth, while expanding operating margin, along with a balanced deployment of capital. We prioritized the plan of our capital both internally and externally on additional growth. A few proof points on our growth-oriented capital deployment strategy. A year ago, we spoke about recently closing the BioTek acquisition and the promise of growth that BioTek represented. Today, BioTek is no longer a promise, but a driver of growth. In total, the cell analysis business generated more than $300 million in revenue for us during the year, with double-digit growth in Q4, and continued strong growth prospects. Similar to last year, I was talking about ramping up our new Frederick site facility, a $185 million capital investment. In addition to successfully ramping Frederick as we planned, we did so with an expanding book of business. We also recently announced additional $150 million investment to add future manufacturing capacity. We are aggressively adding capacity to capture future growth opportunities in this high-growth market. Even in the face of a pandemic, we stayed true to our build and buy strategy. We have clearly seen the advantages of our approach. I'm confident our strategy will continue to produce strong results for us. The strength of our team and resilience of our business model has served us well, and as you can see from the numbers, our growth strategy is producing outstanding results for our customers, employees, and shareholders. While uncertainty remains as we being fiscal 2021, we're operating from a position of strength. Because of this, we're cautiously optimistic about the future. We have built and will sustain our track record of delivering results, and working as a one Agilent team on behalf of our customers and shareholders. As I noted earlier, I couldn't be more pleased with the results the Agilent team delivered in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Thank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob, you're up.\nBob McMahon: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional revenue detail, and take you through the fourth quarter income statement, and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021, and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results as we saw strong growth exceeding our expectations, especially considering the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19. For the quarter, revenue was $1.48 billion, reflecting core revenue growth of 5.6%. Reported growth was stronger, at 8.5%, currency contributed 1.7%, while M&A added 1.2 points of growth. From an end market perspective, pharma, our largest market, showed strength across all regions, and delivered 12% growth in the quarter. Both small and large molecule businesses grew, with large molecule posting strong double-digit growth. We continue to invest and build capabilities in faster growth biopharma markets, and offer leading solutions across both small and large molecule applications. The food market also experienced double-digit growth during the quarter, positing a 16% increase in revenue. While our growth in food business was broad-based, China led the way. And as Mike noted earlier, our chemical and energy market exceeded our expectations growing 3% after two quarters of double-digit declines. Well, one quarter does not a trend make, we are certainly pleased with this result, and the growth came primarily from the chemical and materials segment. Diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 1% during Q4 led by recovery in the U.S. and Europe. We continue to see recovery in non-COVID '19 testing as expected, although the levels that are still slightly below pre-COVID levels. Academia and government was flat to last year, continuing the steady improvement in this market, and revenue in the environmental and forensics market declined mid single-digits against a strong comparison to last year. On a geographic basis, all regions returned to growth. China continues to lead our results with broad based growth across most end markets. For the quarter, China finished with 13% growth, and ended the full-year up 7% just a great result from our team in China. The Americas delivered a strong performance during the quarter, growing 5% with results driven by large pharma food and chemical and energy, and in Europe, we grew 2% as we saw lab activity improved sequentially benefiting from our on-demand service business in ACG, as well as from a rebound in pathology and genomics as elective procedures and screening started to resume. However, while improving CapEx demand still lags are servicing consumables business. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, fourth quarter gross margin was 55%. This was down 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily by a shift in revenue mix and an unfavorable impact of FX on margin. In terms of operating margin, our fourth quarter margin was 24.9%. This is down 20 basis points from Q4 of last year. As we made some incremental growth focused investments in marketing and R&D, which we expect to benefit us in the coming year. The quarter also capped off with full-year operating margin of 23.5%, an increase of 20 basis points over fiscal 2019. Now wrapping up the income statement, our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in at $0.98, up 10% versus last year. Our full-year earnings per share of $3.28 increased 5%. In addition, our operating cash flow continues to be strong. In Q4, we had operating cash flow of $377 million, but more than $60 million over last year, and in Q4, we continued our balanced capital approach to repurchasing $2.48 million shares for $250 million. For the year, we repurchased just over 5.2 million shares for $469 million, and ended the fiscal year in a strong financial position with $1.4 billion in cash and just under $2.4 billion in debt; all-in-all, a very good end to the year. Now let's move on to our outlook for the 2021 fiscal year. We and our customers have been dealing with COVID-19 for nearly a full-year and are seeing our end markets recover. Visibility into the business cadence is improving, and as a result, we're initiating guidance for 2021. There is still a greater than usual level of uncertainty in the marketplace across most regions and so while we're providing guidance, we're doing so with a wider range than we have provided historically. It is with this perspective that we're taking a positive, but prudent view of Q1 in the coming year. For the full-year, we're expecting revenue to range between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 7% in core growth of 4% to 6%. This range takes into account the steady macro environment we're seeing. It does not contemplate any business disruptions caused by extended shutdowns like we saw in the first half of this year. In addition, we're expecting all three of our businesses to grow led by DGG. We expect DDG to grow high single-digits with the continued contribution of NASD ramp and the recovery in cancer diagnostics. We believe ACG will return to its historical high single-digit growth, while LSAG is expected to grow low to mid single-digits. We expect operating margin expansion of 50 to 70 basis points for the year, as we absorbed the build-out costs of the second line and our Frederick Colorado NASD site, and then helping you build out your models, we're planning for a tax rate of 14.75%, which is based on current tax policies, and 309 million of fully diluted shares outstanding, and this includes only anti-dilutive share buybacks. All this translates to a fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $3.57, and $3.67 per share, resulting in double-digit growth at the midpoint. Finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion to $1.05 billion and an increase in capital expenditures to $200 million, driven by our NASD expansion. We have also announced raising our dividend by 8%, continuing an important streak of dividend increases, providing another source of value to our shareholders. Now, let's finish with our first quarter guidance, but before we get into the specifics, some additional context. Many places around the world are currently seeing renewed spikes in COVID-19 that could cause some additional economic uncertainty, and while we're extremely pleased with the momentum we have built during Q4, we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook for Q1 because of the current situation with the pandemic. For Q1, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.42 billion to $1.43 billion, representing recorded growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, and core growth of 3.5% to 4.5% and first quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.88 per share. Before opening the call for questions, I want to conclude by echoing Mike's comments about the amazing work the Agilent team performed during fiscal 2020. To be where we are now, after knowing where we stood in March, is truly remarkable. Add to this the strong momentum we saw in Q4, I truly believe we are well-positioned to accelerate our growth in fiscal 2021. With that, Ankur, back to you for Q&A.\nAnkur Dhingra: Thanks, Bob. David, let's provide the instructions for Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys, congrats on the good prints here, and a couple of questions for me.\nMike McMullen: Hey, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: Mike, maybe first on the guidance part here, I guess with a Q1 guidance of 4.5% to 5.5% core, does it have -- does it assume any core tailwinds because, I guess you look at Q4, I mean 6% core, any reason why the core should slow down sequentially?\nMike McMullen: Yes, let me start with, Bob. So again, thanks for the earlier comments, Vijay. So how to characterize our Q1 guide is positive, but we're using a very prudent approach, and that we got a lot of confidence in that in terms of we're reinstating the guidance, and we had very good momentum in Q4, and we looked at the backlog, we feel very confident about reinstating guidance, but the virus is still out there, and we still think there's still a higher level of uncertainty that calls for a prudent approach, so hence the positive but prudent approach. If it turns out better we'd be -- we'd love to be in a position of being able to raise our outlook for the year, but we thought for the first guide for the year, including Q1, and we should take a positive and prudent approach, this is recognizing that the virus is still out there. Bob, I don't know if you'd like to add anything to that.\nBob McMahon: Yes, Vijay, I think a couple of things, you know, the thing that I would say is we didn't end the year with emptying the tank out, and feel really good about that, but that being said, we do have some business that is somewhat susceptible to some of these areas, and so we probably have greater visibility or variability in some of our diagnostics businesses. So, as Mike said, we're taking kind of prudent approach there, and the other area is we want to see more than just one quarter in the chemical and energy business. I think that's one of the areas where I think -- we think we're biased to the upside and the way we're kind of thinking about the business, but it's certainly with a recovery. We do expect some COVID tailwinds, to your point. It's probably on the order of roughly about one-and-a-half to two points, kind of consistent with what we've seen in the last -- the last several quarters. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Bob; and Mike, one bigger picture question for you. I think you mentioned NASD was up 40% in the quarter. Did that business accelerate NASD, and I'm curious, the longer-term opportunity here when you think about it, how -- can this end up being a $500 million product for Agilent as you look at four or five years out? I'm curious to know your thoughts, and Bob, I think you mentioned the 50 to 70 basis points of margin expansion inclusive of investments in Frederick facility. What do you think the impact was of those investments on the margins, or I guess what I'm asking is what should margin expansion have been without those investments? Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Hey, Bob -- thanks for the questions, Vijay. How about I take the first part, and then you can take the second part. So that's not out of the realm of reason, your first question in terms of the longer-term potential total revenue for Agilent. We kind of put a teaser out there earlier about our December analyst and investor day, so we'll talk a bit more about NASD when we meet, but as you know, we are really pleased with -- and we've talked about in the past in terms of getting to that exit rate of over $200 million business, and while our capacity in terms of the physical capacity is built, we're now just finishing up the first year of operations, so we're -- just like we did with our Boulder site continue to find ways to drive more productivity and efficiency out of that asset, and we just announced another expansion of another production line within that existing facility. So I hope what you're hearing is a very bullish tone, both in terms of the market growth but also our ability to get our -- more of our unfair share, if you will, to the capital share in a growing market.\nBob McMahon: Yes, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to build on that, what Mike talked about, the beauty of that business is it continues to accelerate throughout the year, and that 40% -- that roughly 40% in Q4 was the highest it was all year, and that team has done just a fantastic job of scaling that business, and we're not done, and as Mike said, we're making incremental investments in building out that capacity, which we'll continue to make throughout the course of next year. That is probably about a 20 basis point headwind next year and in the operating margin just rough numbers there, Vijay, but extremely pleased with the work that that team has been able to do, and continuing to drive that growth, and so we feel very good about that business.\nVijay Kumar: Thank you, guys.\nMike McMullen: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, hi, Bob and Mike. Thanks for taking the question. So, Bob, actually on one of the question on guidance, and this is probably a favorite topic for you, the Chinese Lunar New Year.\nMike McMullen: Oh yes. That's the New Year again, isn't it?\nPuneet Souda: That time of the year. So, this time, obviously, you are seeing how the troops are acting on the ground, how things are there, and I would suspect it would be a lesser impact this year, lesser travel, but correct me if I'm wrong on that, and then in light of that, I mean the guidance again appears conservative. Is there anything that we ought to keep in mind for a market that is growing double-digit for you already, and is a sizable portion of your revenue? So just walk us through how are you thinking about the Lunar New Year impact here.\nBob McMahon: Yes, that's a great question, Puneet, and as you accurately state, our expectation is the impact is going to be much less this year than it was last year for all the things that you just talked about, less travel, timing of when it is, and so forth, relative to Q1, and what we're seeing is actually very strong continued recovery and performance in our China business, and I would say that there's -- Q1 is no different, and so, the story there certainly remains in tact, and I would expect it to be very strong performance in Q1. I think what we're trying to do is there's nothing in particular, but I think we're just probably taking a little more prudent approach in Europe, and as we're seeing some of the shutdowns, particularly in some of these areas. And I think as we look at where are the things that could potentially be upsides or downsides, I think that continued recovery in chemical and energy across the business, also continued performance in Americas. We're expecting kind of an average budget flush, so to speak. That's another question that's probably -- if people are thinking about by -- for the end of the year and both of those things could be better than expected.\nMike McMullen: Yes, Bob, I could just jump into that, just amplify the point, Puneet, that Bob made. We're very, very happy with our China business, and we exited the year with momentum, and that's carrying forward into 2021. We're positioning ourselves with a wait-and-see moment on C&E, and that could be a source of upside for the year, and like I said earlier, we're fully prepared to reflect that in a revised outlook, and I would just use the word, maybe, prudent as a way to describe as the adjective Bob and I have been using to describe our guide.\nPuneet Souda: Okay, that's -- no, that's very helpful, thanks, and if I could get a sense on the -- in the cell analysis business, that business continues to be really strong for you, BioTek, [indiscernible] horse, other products in that product line, just wanted to get a sense of what are some of the key drivers there, is it largely the cell and gene therapy, the cellular product and drug product market, or is there something in the academic end that is driving that growth or specifically in China? Would appreciate and helping frame what's exactly happening there, and the opportunity there longer-term.\nMike McMullen: Yes, Puneet, thanks for the question, and as I mentioned in my call script, we're really pleased with how we've been able to integrate the BioTek team, make them part of the Agilent family, and then how that collective has lead to having us have a very healthy cell analysis, just north of $300 million, growing nicely for us, and I know that Jacob would love to be able to have an opportunity to talk a little bit more about the cell analysis, back to Jacob, your thoughts on the specific questions that Puneet put forward?\nJacob Thaysen: First of all, let me just echo that I think it's very impressive what Agilent has been doing here the past year, and the growth actually stems from many multiple dimensions here. First of all, we have seen, so first of all, with the testing that a lot of our BioTek portfolio has been using for that for the ELISA testing, and -- but we also see, generally speaking, imaging being very relevant in the academic markets, but also in the biopharma markets, and the [CS] [ph] portfolio with the flow of tachometry is also seeing quite a lot of interest. So it's really broad across both academic and biopharma and COVID-related that we see interest. Lifestyle analysis was where we felt a few years ago that this was an area that would continue to see in our growth. Particularly that point about immune-oncology, we're pleased that has moved into a broader understanding on the immune system, right now on COVID, but generally speaking I think would be a focus for many years to come. So very pleased, and we continue to expect good growth in that business.\nMike McMullen: Yes, and hey, Puneet, just one thing because you mentioned China, and we see really China as a huge opportunity for us going forward. The real growth has been primarily in the U.S. and Europe. I mean it's growing in China as well, but it's off a very small base. So when we think about the opportunities going forward, leveraging the large infrastructure that Agilent has is really a big opportunity for us for many, many years to come in the cell analysis space.\nPuneet Souda: Great. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, good afternoon. Mike, I wondering if you could talk a little more on the biopharma strength, 12% on a 7% comp is obviously phenomenal. I know you had 2% from NASD, and you just talked about cell analysis, but can you maybe just talk more broadly on the strength in biopharma. Was any of this a catch-up from slower setting in the first-half of the year? And how do you think about the sustainability of demand. I know you mentioned you're thinking about an average budget flush, but can you just talk to the broader strength in biopharma?\nMike McMullen: Yes, sure, happy to do so, Tycho, and without giving away too many of the tidbits that I want to talk about more -- in more depth in a few weeks. There was no catch-up here. This is part of this continued strength in the biopharma area. It's an area of focus, and we'll go into some more detail with you in a few weeks, but it's an area of focus in terms of increased investments relative to our biopharma tools, but the instrumentation along with chemistry platform, a real workflow focus there across the whole value chain, but we're getting growth, as you mentioned earlier, NASD, but that's -- the story is much bigger, and bigger, and that's to be honest with you. And then, obviously, we're picking up some growth here in the cell analysis. So I think it's really a multifaceted strategy that really driving this growth. We think it's sustainable. We think a double-digit outlook on the biopharma portion of Agilent's business is quite reasonable. We're really excited, and it's an investment priority for us.\nBob McMahon: Yes, and Tycho, maybe if I can add to Mike's point, in terms of -- because it's not only the platforms in the portfolio that we have on the instrument basis, which we've been making some heavy investments in, but it's also been the informatics and the software piece, which is has allowed us to be able to kind of plug in to the labs, the analytical labs, and then you bring in the ACG services portfolio that helped them manage the labs, and particularly with everything that's going on right now, the last thing they want is their scientists to be managing the instrumentation. They want them to be doing the science, and so, we think we've got a very compelling software and tools offering, and I think it's showing up in the marketplace across multiple technology platforms really.\nTycho Peterson: Great, and then Mike, you used the phrase, wait and see mode for C&E a couple minutes ago, and it's good to see that back to growth, can you maybe just talk on some of the data points you're watching in your customer base and how you're thinking about the recovery curve there?\nMike McMullen: Yes, thanks Tycho. So, my comments come back from my first year as a CEO when I tried to call the trend of the C&E business, and eventually it turned out I think it was all by several quarters. So I learned my lesson, so to speak. So as Bob mentioned, one quarter trend does not make but we're very encouraged by that, because it's the first time we've seen some growth after those two double-digit declines earlier this year. And we look at a couple of things, Tycho one is the PMIs and the positive moves in the PMIs are indicative of improved end market strength, particularly in C&E, we also look at what we estimate to be the age of the installed base, because a lot of aged equipment out there, and that's been probably at very high levels, and then we look at the deal flow. So, kind of all those factors, the macro outlook from PMIs what we know to be the current environment for customers in terms of the age of their installed base, and then also overseen in our funnels, and you know, Agilent has a real strength in this market. So I think we will benefit from returned to growth, again we're not ready yet to put it into numbers for Q1 in the full-year, but we're hopeful that that trend will continue. There're some indications that it could, but let's give it another quarter or so.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, and then lastly before I hop off, one quick one on China, one of your coolest companies, Mettler, talked about pent-up demand kind of suggested that what they saw may not be sustainable. Have you seen anything in your order book that would suggest what you're seeing in China?\nMike McMullen: Yes, no, Tycho really appreciate you asking that question because not at all, I mean, this has been a continuing steady flow of business. We think the end markets are really strong here. We see a lot of strength in China Government funding to make sure they stimulate the economy, and then we talked earlier about just overall their investments in improving the quality of life, you noticed the strong growth in the food market, continued strength in pharma. So no, we've seen this. Now, I think we really look closely at the pacing and it's all nothing unusual.\nBob McMahon: Yes, Tycho, I think we've been extraordinarily pleased with the way our China businesses performed throughout the course of this year, and when you think about kind of our cadence through Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, we've seen accelerated growth. So we saw our lowest growth in the first quarter where we saw the impact of COVID-19, but then what we've seen is improvements as opposed to this real huge increase, and then kind of a drop-off. So, we're not expecting any drop-off, and we haven't seen that in our order book or any of the conversations that we've had with our customers that there was sort of a material catch-up.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.\nMike McMullen: You're quite welcome, Tycho.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon; Mike, a couple of questions on LSAG.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nBrandon Couillard: I'm curious, if you could speak to the order book in the fourth quarter, and to the extent that you may have built some backlog there, and curious to speak to perhaps the margin compression in the fourth quarter, but that was mostly mix or is today's dynamics there?\nMike McMullen: Happy to see you, Brandon. So, one of the reasons why we were able to reinstate guidance this year was what we saw in the LSAG order book, and as you know, we stopped a few years ago talking about specifics around orders, but I think in today's call, it's really prudent for us to give you a sense of why Bob and I have this confidence around the outlook. So we didn't guessed as we ran across the finish line for 2020, order book was strong in LSAG and as continued into the fairly few weeks of this year. So again, all the other caveats aside being prudent and recognition of the virus, we feel pretty good about our ability to reinstate guideline because as we mentioned earlier reinstate guidance as mentioned earlier, LSAG was one where we hit the most early on the year, and I think we're feeling pretty good about that. And Bob, as I recall, most of the gross margin is really just a mix of the various instrument platforms.\nBob McMahon: Yes, that's right. I mean, I think Brandon, to read what Mike is saying, I mean we feel very good, orders exceeded revenue and exceeded our expectations, and so, it was a bit of a mix shift that is impacting that, but we would expect that to kind of normalize out throughout the course of next year, and so, we feel very good about kind of where that business is going into 2021.\nMike McMullen: Yes, Brandon, just one additional thought here which is, we've seen a real change in the price environment. So, that's why we can say pretty common that has happened to be the mix product this quarter.\nBrandon Couillard: Super, and one more for Bob, you mentioned currency with the drag to margins in the fourth quarter, could you quantify that, the magnitude of the operating line, and then what you penciled in for impact of FX to operating margins in '21?\nBob McMahon: Yes, it was roughly about 40-ish, 45-ish on the COGS line, and some of that was offset through the bottom line, and for next year less impactful, much less impactful than that, probably less than about 10 points, 10 basis points.\nBrandon Couillard: Super, thanks.\nMike McMullen: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. So, to start off, on the guidance, a question for probably you Bob, you've touched on this in pieces, but can you give us at a high level what your key assumptions are, by region and by end-markets?\nBob McMahon: Yes, so by at the highest level, we're expecting steady improvement throughout the course of the year from the standpoint of the economic perspective, if I think about it from a geography first, China's going to lead the way with high single-digit growth continuing the momentum that we've seen, we ended this year FY '20 about 7%, and we're expecting that or better into next year, and then what you would see as a recovery in the Americas getting back to kind of mid to high single-digits, and then followed by Europe, which would be kind of the low to mid single-digits. So that's kind of on an end market perspective, how we would think about it, it's predicated on that continued recovery, and that we would as I mentioned before, not have any extended periods of shutdown that would disrupt business. I think the good thing is what we're seeing not only ourselves, but our customers are being able to operate in a different environment than they had the first time these were shut down. So we're not expecting any material impact there, and from an end-market perspective, the strength is really going to be the continued strength that we've seen in the last several years really driven behind our pharma business, which is probably high single-digits with biopharma as one of the earlier questions came out, probably growing double-digits going forward. And then food, we'll probably expect maybe a little tempering, where it'd be great to have 16% every quarter, but we're not ready to put that into our plan, but I would expect continued recovery there probably in the mid-single-digits and also recovery in our diagnostics and clinical business, particularly in that same kind of mid-single-digits, and probably ramping throughout the course of the year, probably more muted on the academia, and government probably flattish to low, and as we talked about before chemical and energy flattish, but that's really one where we're hoping that we're biased, and there's more upside than downside here, but certainly given the momentum, but one quarter is too early to put a forecast on there, and so, we're assuming roughly flat and then probably recovery in the environmental and forensics market low-single-digits.\nDan Leonard: Okay, thanks for that overview, and that's my follow-up, you touched on there being a wider range of outcomes in '21 and typical and mentioned at the bottom end doesn't capture any threats around reestablishment of lockdowns or whatnot. Do you feel the high-end of guidance really captures all the benefits from easy comparisons, any potential upside there might be or how would you frame, what you're capturing in the high-end there?\nBob McMahon: Yes, I'd say it's continued momentum, but I think that there's probably more upsides and downsides in the way that we're trying to capture that certainly exiting at a 6% growth rate, there are we're probably the biggest areas are around chemical and energy and the pace of recovery in academia and government, and if those continue, I would say - let me put it this way, if chemical and energy continued at 3% and growing, we'll be that number.\nDan Leonard: Yes, absolutely. Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDouglas Schenkel: Hi, good afternoon guys.\nMike McMullen: Good evening, Doug.\nDouglas Schenkel: Maybe I have a few cleanup guidance questions, but before I get to that one, I just wanted to talk about your performance specific to your mass spec product line. You talked about another quarter of double-digit growth. I'm just wondering if you'd be willing to unpack that a bit more and just talk about what's driving this, and specifically is China and more specifically China food, a major driver, I guess I'm just trying to get at which segments of the portfolio or specific end markets or geographies that really stand out within a pretty robust and impressive growth rate there?\nMike McMullen: Hi, Doug really appreciate the opportunity to have Jacob comment more deeply on that, but as you know, I highlighted that in my script, we were able to call out that double-digit growth. We're extremely proud of that. And Jacob, I think you've got some additional insights that you could share with Doug.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, that's a great question, and I'm certainly proud of what the team has been doing over the past years, because this is not only a quarterly effect here, but we have done a quiet and overhaul of our master portfolio, particularly the LC/MS portfolio over the last few years, both on the high-end triple quad, but also the single quad, and [indiscernible] the team applications, and this is really what the customer is looking for right now. So, you can really see that the investments we have done really resonates with our customer base, and right now, I would say in most geographies and in most end markets, but if you look into it's biopharma and China is definitely a big part of this story, but -- and the other element into it is that we pivoted very quickly to remote customer engagement during this beginning of this year, and when the customer has to shut down the laboratories, we were there for them. We did support them when the tough times, and you can see that pay dividends today that they also continue with the partnership with accidents. So, I actually believe that we are in a quite good momentum here with the mass aide business.\nDouglas Schenkel: Yes, all right.\nDouglas Schenkel: Yes, that sure does. Thank you for that, and then maybe just a few guidance questions, yes, so this'll be kind of a speed round in a way, because you have got some questions about these already, but on China, did you expect double-digit growth in fiscal '21? On gross margin, you talked about some of the headwinds you saw in Q4 becoming less pronounced moving forward. So, do you expect gross margin overall to get back up to the 56 plus level? And then on COVID-19, I think you talked about just over two points of COVID tailwinds in the quarter. I'm just wondering if looking forward either fiscal Q1 or for the full-year, if you could see a scenario where this would accelerate over time if serology volumes began to inflect in a positive way and same thing on the antibody business, could those in combination drive more of a tailwind moving forward, so China gross margin and COVID-19?\nBob McMahon: Yes, so China, high single-digits, maybe low double-digits based on the range that we gave you in terms of COVID what I would say is, we are expecting less incremental the growth, but certainly the things that you talked about are baked into our guidance. So more serology our antigen based testing or even vaccine driven volume is not fully baked into the numbers that we are -- it's just too early to tell, but those are certainly be things that are potential upsides, and then the last one, I know which was your second question around gross margin, I would expect it to stabilize and not see this the same level of decline. Now, what I would say is you will have some mix shifts, right, because our ACG business, which is lower gross margin than the instrument business, but much higher operating margin helps us with that. So, you do see a dampening effect on the gross margin side, but you will more than make up for it on the operating margin side.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay, Bob. Sorry.\nBob McMahon: Doug specific to COVID-19 we'll hit a little bit more of that when we have our Analyst Day, but we are planning to launch in early 2021 our serology test, and there are some things that we're working on that aren't baked into the guide. We'll see how that they play out.\nDouglas Schenkel: Okay, that's great. Thank you guys for all the time and happy Thanksgiving everybody.\nBob McMahon: Same to you.\nDouglas Schenkel: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi, good afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Hi, Derik.\nBob McMahon: Hi, Derik.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi, so I'm going to do this similar to Doug. I've got a couple of focus questions. I got one guidance cleanup. So I guess specifically, Bob, you mentioned some software pushes in business between the pharma business. Can you be a little bit more specific on that? I mean, is OpenLab taking share against Empower, you winning have be replaced Empower and some of the accounts there, I'm just sort of curious on what the dynamics are in the CDS market?\nMike McMullen: Yes. What I would say Doug, excuse me, Derik, is that we feel very good about our competitive positioning with OpenLab and the rest of our products.\nDerik de Bruin: Okay. Now I'll live with that I guess. Yes, and by the way, I'm better looking than Doug. On the Core Genomics business, I mean, we don't really have talk about that. I mean, you talk about the NASD and some other things here, but what is going on in your Core Genomics business, you've got SureSelect, I mean, you've had some pressures and some of that end market there. What is that underlying business growing?\nBob McMahon: Yes, actually a great question because we didn't highlight that, but actually when you look at sequential performance, that was one of the things that was very, very positive in the DDG business. It recovered very nicely into Q4, and maybe I'll let Sam talk about some of the details there.\nSam Raha: Yes, sure. Thanks, Bob. As you said, as we went into the heavy part of the pandemic, if you will, late Q2, Q3, some of the Genomics business also serves clinical diagnostic customers be it for SureSelect being the backbone and some of the leading cancer diagnostic and US-based tests as well as other inherited diseases. So we definitely saw the effect of that, but coming into Q4, we've seen a steady stream of increase there, and we've also seen a positive effect in parts of our portfolio that are related to qPCR be it instruments, be it our consumables that are used and also we have the leading Genomics QC portfolio as you're probably aware of, and we see a number of those products, including our fragment analyzer being used increasingly for picking up conventional or sorry, would the pickup of conventional clinical testing, but also being used for example for some siRNA vaccines that are in development. So, all-in-all, the trend is looking encouraging for our Core Genomics business.\nDerik de Bruin: Great, and then just one housekeeping question. For '21, the other income expense line, how should we think about that for '21? Bob do you want to handle that or you want to take that?\nBob McMahon: Yes, that'd be slightly better than where it is this year.\nDerik de Bruin: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nMike McMullen: Hello, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Thanks. Hi, good afternoon. Let me go back to biopharm, Mike, I was curious if you're seeing any change in terms of customer spending patterns at all, because of COVID-19, there is just been such a focus on bioprocessing, the support vaccines and therapeutics. What's that doing in small molecule if you can call out any trends?\nMike McMullen: Jack, great question. So, to our delight, it really hasn't seen them cause any kind of material shift. I mean, we're seeing -- in fact, I think Bob in his script, where we saw strength across small molecule and bio -- large molecule. Now the small molecule is not growing as fast as large molecules, it was growing, and\u2026\nBob McMahon: Yes, Jack to give you some numbers, I mean for Q4 small molecule grew high single-digits, and for the year it grew low single-digits. So despite all the hoopla, small molecule is not dead.\nJack Meehan: Yes. Great, and maybe just to build on that, so the high teens ACG growth in China, could you just parse out for us? How did food do versus how did maybe generics do in terms of some of that consolidation there?\nMike McMullen: Bob, as I recall, and I'd like Padraig on this, I think it was broad-based across all end-markets. Everything was in that double-digit range, and Padraig anything you could add to that?\nPadraig McDonnell: No, I think you said it well, Mike, I think across both sides of the business, both the chemistries serves as very strong demand in all markets, and we see certainly a strong demand for our installation familiarization and startup services. So I'm really strong across the board in China.\nJack Meehan: Great, thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Let me follow-up on the --\nMike McMullen: Hi, Patrick.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, Mike, just on the chemical and energy side, it certainly sounds like that's the biggest area of upside, maybe the biggest variable for next year. Sounds like chemicals and material things are improving, can you just give a bit more detail around the customer tone there, and then is energy the bigger variable for '21 maybe just talk through kind of the scenario analysis as you guys think about it certainly seems like there's upside, but maybe just kind of what parts of the business you feel like are the biggest variable there?\nMike McMullen: Yes, I think that sort of all the kind of this always helpful reminder, but in a kind of our mix, so it's 70:30, 70:30 in chemicals and materials, and 30% energy. Actually the upside on the chemical and material, energy lags, and we aren't really seeing a lot of indications of why that would, that would pick up, but you have to remember some of the chemical companies are actually providing products and such into end markets that support COVID-19. They're feeling, what drives this marketplace? Yes, we talked about PMIs, but really all the PMIs are really related to the view of global growth, and I think that customer base is feeling more confident about where the economy is going and things this shut really slowed down earlier this year just for a must kind of purchases, but I think it's a prove view of the overall economic outlook for the chemical and materials side plus the fact that they have some kind of COVID-19 tailwind to help out. I wouldn't say that's the entire story is just the element of it. I think the biggest part here is just the fact that there's much more common in the customer base about the growth environment from an economic standpoint, Bob anything you would add to that?\nBob McMahon: Thank you, Mike. I don't.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay, yes, that's very helpful, and then maybe just on a capital deployment side. You guys always take the balanced approach, and I'm sure we'll hear more about it in a couple of weeks, but how are things trending in the pipeline on the M&A side, your cash flow has actually been pretty strong? How active should we expect you guys to be on that front? Any changes and thoughts around the size of deals you want to pursue, and any metrics you can throw out there would be helpful? Thanks.\nMike McMullen: No, no we continue to be very interested in deploying capital for growth standpoint along all the dimensions we talked about earlier. We said that the BioTek size deal, which we were really quite happy with that, that was largest deal we've done to-date. That doesn't mean that would be the largest deal we would do. We've always said, I think it was not magnitudes of delta, and although we didn't closed any deals this year, I think that really was somewhat tied into some of the COVID-19 challenges of doing due diligence and working with potential targets, but we still see this as a key part of our, what we call, our build and buy growth strategy, and think that M&A can be a nice attitude to our core growth businesses. So you guessed right, so we'll talk more about it in a few weeks. We still have aspirations in the space, but really sticking to the model, the framework that we've been using before, which is M&A in markets at a higher growth investor company that aligns strategically with us where they can benefit by our scale and are accretive to the P&L.\nBob McMahon: Yes, I would say Patrick, just to build on what Mike was saying. I mean, we feel very good about the acquisitions that we made, the last two which was BioTek and ACEA were probably the fastest growing parts of our business, if you take out NASD, and so, I think it validates the space that we're looking at, and we don't see a reason to need to change our M&A framework.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Beuchaw: Hi, thanks for sneaking me in here. I'll just ask one maybe I guess it's a two-parter; one part for Mike, one part for Bob, and\u2026\nMike McMullen: Okay, I'll be giving easy one.\nSteve Beuchaw: I think you're going to like it. I think you are going to like it.\nMike McMullen: Okay.\nSteve Beuchaw: Mike, so last call, you raised this concept, you called it a flight to quality, and you talked about how the team with the execution has been able to drive share gains, I wonder if you could talk about whether you think that as the pandemic subsided in some ways and labs are opening up again, if you think that dynamic has become any more or less acute, and if you think it's sticky, I'm going to go ahead and ask the second part of my -- I guess I'll call it COVID discovery question for Bob; Bob, like a lot of CFOs, you've had a chance to see how much you can save within operating expenses, as we're all working remotely and being more digital. Have you thought about putting any numbers around how much of the savings that you've discovered here could end up being permanent? Thanks a bunch, everybody.\nMike McMullen: Yes, thanks, Steve. So, in regards to the first one, we probably talked about the flight to quality when money is tight, but we also think tied it to stability, and how we protected our overall field team and our ability to support our customers during the pandemic. So, I think those two things are going to carry us forward. So we think that the stickiness will remain there, and I don't think that the quality will fall out of fashion, and I think as you continue to grow your position in the installed base, it just gives you an upper hand in terms of next buy when they get around to making the next capital purchasing decision.\nBob McMahon: Yes, I would agree with that, Mike, and I think that, you know, I think two things; one is, we were there when the customers needed us the most, and our team particularly in the field, helping support critical operations and so forth, and that flight to quality on the instrumentation side only pays dividends going forward. So, I think there is no -- there will be no follow-up there, I truly believe that. On the cost side, we're still working through some of those things, a big thing, probably the biggest variable here, and it's got a couple of different tentacles to it would be around travel, and I think we had talked about before at one point in time we're spending roughly $10 million a month in travel, and that that is down, I would say substantially, and our goal is that will be back to $10 million a month, and so, that doesn't say that we're going to necessarily drop it all to the bottom line, but reinvest in some areas that will drive growth going forward, but certainly those, and then there will be more efficient ways of doing things like marketing outreach to our customers, and even operating, one of the things is we still operated and launched new products, despite not having been in the labs for the most part for nine months out of the year, and so, our teams are finding innovative ways to continue to actually move things around without having to spend incremental dollars, so more to come on that.\nMike McMullen: We think [some things] [ph] are going to stick. Particularly, as it relates to your digital engagement with customers, because there's a huge element of being responsive, and we think that digital cable is a big part of that story, and yes, it has been accelerated by COVID, but we don't think there's any going back either.\nSteve Beuchaw: Got it. Thank you for all the color, guys.\nMike McMullen: You're quite welcome.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "content": "First of all, let me just echo that I think it's very impressive what Agilent has been doing here the past year, and the growth actually stems from many multiple dimensions here. First of all, we have seen, so first of all, with the testing that a lot of our BioTek portfolio has been using for that for the ELISA testing, and -- but we also see, generally speaking, imaging being very relevant in the academic markets, but also in the biopharma markets, and the [CS] [ph] portfolio with the flow of tachometry is also seeing quite a lot of interest. So it's really broad across both academic and biopharma and COVID-related that we see interest. Lifestyle analysis was where we felt a few years ago that this was an area that would continue to see in our growth. Particularly that point about immune-oncology, we're pleased that has moved into a broader understanding on the immune system, right now on COVID, but generally speaking I think would be a focus for many years to come. So very pleased, and we continue to expect good growth in that business. Yes, that's a great question, and I'm certainly proud of what the team has been doing over the past years, because this is not only a quarterly effect here, but we have done a quiet and overhaul of our master portfolio, particularly the LC/MS portfolio over the last few years, both on the high-end triple quad, but also the single quad, and [indiscernible] the team applications, and this is really what the customer is looking for right now. So, you can really see that the investments we have done really resonates with our customer base, and right now, I would say in most geographies and in most end markets, but if you look into it's biopharma and China is definitely a big part of this story, but -- and the other element into it is that we pivoted very quickly to remote customer engagement during this beginning of this year, and when the customer has to shut down the laboratories, we were there for them.

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks, Ankur, and thanks to everyone for joining us on our call today. Today, I want to get straight to our quarterly results, because they tell a very compelling story. The Agilent team delivered a very strong close to 2020. We posted revenues of $1.48 billion during the quarter. Revenues are up 8% on a reported basis, and up 6% core. Operating margins are a healthy 24.9%. EPS of $0.98 is up 10% year-over-year. These numbers tell the story of a strong resilient company that's built for continued growth. Our better than expected results are due to the strength of our core business, along with signs of recovery in our end markets. Geographically, China continues to lead the way with double-digit growth. From an end-market view, both our pharmaceutical and food businesses grew double-digits. In addition, our chemical and energy business grew after two quarters of declines, exceeding our expectations. We also saw a rebound in U.S. sales during the quarter. Overall, COVID-19 tailwinds contributed just over two points of core growth. Achieving these results in the face of a global pandemic is a tribute to our team and the company we've built over the last five years. I couldn't be more pleased with the way the Agilent team has performed over the last quarter and throughout 2020. We have again proven our ability to work together and step up to meet any challenge that comes our way. During the quarter, all three of our business groups grew high single-digits on a reported basis. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $671 million in revenue, up 8% on a reported basis, and up 4% core. LSAG growth is broad-based. The cell analysis and mass spec businesses both grew at double-digit rates. In terms of end markets, chemical and energy returned to growth, food grew double-digits, and pharma high single-digits. LSAG remains extremely well-positioned and is outperforming the market. The Agilent CrossLab Group came in with revenues at $518 million. This is up a reported 9% and up 7% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based across end markets and geographies. Our focus on on-demand service is paying off as activities in our customer's labs continues to increase. The ACG team continues to build on it's already deep connections with our customers, helping them operate through the pandemic, and continue to drive improved efficiencies in lab operations. In the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, revenues were $294 million, up 9% reported, and up 7% core. Growth was broad-based, with NASD oligo manufacturing revenues up roughly 40%. The Genomics and pathology businesses continue to improve during the quarter. I'm also very proud of our NASD team for successfully ramping production at our new Frederick site this year. We have built a very strong position in this attractive market, with excellent long-term prospects for high growth. Let's now shift gears and look at our full-year fiscal 2020 results. Despite the disruption, uncertainty, and economic turmoil dealing with a global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered solid results. We generated $5.34 billion in revenue, up 3% on a reported basis, and up nearly 1% core. To put this in perspective, it's helpful to recall the progression of our growth. In Q1, we delivered 2% core growth, as you saw the first impact of COVID-19 in our business in China. Both Q2 and Q3 declined low single-digits as the pandemic spread across the globe and governments instituted broad shutdowns. With 6% core growth, 8% reported in Q4, we're seeing business and economies start to recover. As a result, we are clearly exiting 2020 with solid momentum. Our recurring types of businesses, represented by ACG and DGG prove resilient, growing low to mid single-digits for the year. In a very tough CapEx market, our LSAG instrument business declined only 2% for the year, and returned to growth in the final quarter. China led the way for our recovery with accelerating growth as the year progressed. In our end markets, pharma remained the most resilient, and food markets recovered most quickly. Full-year earnings per share grew 5% during fiscal 2020, to $3.28. The full-year operating margin of 23.5% is up 20 basis points over fiscal 2019. As we head into 2021 we do so with tremendous advantage. Our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy, with the focus of high growth markets continues to deliver. Our ability to respond quickly to rapidly changing conditions is also serving us well. The way our sales and service teams have been able to quickly pivot to meet customer requirements during the pandemic has been nothing short of remarkable. You know, last year this time, I used this call to remind you of the Agilent shareholder value creation model. Our approach is focused on delivering above market growth, while expanding operating margin, along with a balanced deployment of capital. We prioritized the plan of our capital both internally and externally on additional growth. A few proof points on our growth-oriented capital deployment strategy. A year ago, we spoke about recently closing the BioTek acquisition and the promise of growth that BioTek represented. Today, BioTek is no longer a promise, but a driver of growth. In total, the cell analysis business generated more than $300 million in revenue for us during the year, with double-digit growth in Q4, and continued strong growth prospects. Similar to last year, I was talking about ramping up our new Frederick site facility, a $185 million capital investment. In addition to successfully ramping Frederick as we planned, we did so with an expanding book of business. We also recently announced additional $150 million investment to add future manufacturing capacity. We are aggressively adding capacity to capture future growth opportunities in this high-growth market. Even in the face of a pandemic, we stayed true to our build and buy strategy. We have clearly seen the advantages of our approach. I'm confident our strategy will continue to produce strong results for us. The strength of our team and resilience of our business model has served us well, and as you can see from the numbers, our growth strategy is producing outstanding results for our customers, employees, and shareholders. While uncertainty remains as we being fiscal 2021, we're operating from a position of strength. Because of this, we're cautiously optimistic about the future. We have built and will sustain our track record of delivering results, and working as a one Agilent team on behalf of our customers and shareholders. As I noted earlier, I couldn't be more pleased with the results the Agilent team delivered in the fourth quarter and throughout the year. Thank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob, you're up. Hey, Vijay. Yes, let me start with, Bob. So again, thanks for the earlier comments, Vijay. So how to characterize our Q1 guide is positive, but we're using a very prudent approach, and that we got a lot of confidence in that in terms of we're reinstating the guidance, and we had very good momentum in Q4, and we looked at the backlog, we feel very confident about reinstating guidance, but the virus is still out there, and we still think there's still a higher level of uncertainty that calls for a prudent approach, so hence the positive but prudent approach. If it turns out better we'd be -- we'd love to be in a position of being able to raise our outlook for the year, but we thought for the first guide for the year, including Q1, and we should take a positive and prudent approach, this is recognizing that the virus is still out there. Bob, I don't know if you'd like to add anything to that. Hey, Bob -- thanks for the questions, Vijay. How about I take the first part, and then you can take the second part. So that's not out of the realm of reason, your first question in terms of the longer-term potential total revenue for Agilent. We kind of put a teaser out there earlier about our December analyst and investor day, so we'll talk a bit more about NASD when we meet, but as you know, we are really pleased with -- and we've talked about in the past in terms of getting to that exit rate of over $200 million business, and while our capacity in terms of the physical capacity is built, we're now just finishing up the first year of operations, so we're -- just like we did with our Boulder site continue to find ways to drive more productivity and efficiency out of that asset, and we just announced another expansion of another production line within that existing facility. So I hope what you're hearing is a very bullish tone, both in terms of the market growth but also our ability to get our -- more of our unfair share, if you will, to the capital share in a growing market. You're welcome. Oh yes. That's the New Year again, isn't it? Yes, Bob, I could just jump into that, just amplify the point, Puneet, that Bob made. We're very, very happy with our China business, and we exited the year with momentum, and that's carrying forward into 2021. We're positioning ourselves with a wait-and-see moment on C&E, and that could be a source of upside for the year, and like I said earlier, we're fully prepared to reflect that in a revised outlook, and I would just use the word, maybe, prudent as a way to describe as the adjective Bob and I have been using to describe our guide. Yes, Puneet, thanks for the question, and as I mentioned in my call script, we're really pleased with how we've been able to integrate the BioTek team, make them part of the Agilent family, and then how that collective has lead to having us have a very healthy cell analysis, just north of $300 million, growing nicely for us, and I know that Jacob would love to be able to have an opportunity to talk a little bit more about the cell analysis, back to Jacob, your thoughts on the specific questions that Puneet put forward? Yes, and hey, Puneet, just one thing because you mentioned China, and we see really China as a huge opportunity for us going forward. The real growth has been primarily in the U.S. and Europe. I mean it's growing in China as well, but it's off a very small base. So when we think about the opportunities going forward, leveraging the large infrastructure that Agilent has is really a big opportunity for us for many, many years to come in the cell analysis space. Yes, sure, happy to do so, Tycho, and without giving away too many of the tidbits that I want to talk about more -- in more depth in a few weeks. There was no catch-up here. This is part of this continued strength in the biopharma area. It's an area of focus, and we'll go into some more detail with you in a few weeks, but it's an area of focus in terms of increased investments relative to our biopharma tools, but the instrumentation along with chemistry platform, a real workflow focus there across the whole value chain, but we're getting growth, as you mentioned earlier, NASD, but that's -- the story is much bigger, and bigger, and that's to be honest with you. And then, obviously, we're picking up some growth here in the cell analysis. So I think it's really a multifaceted strategy that really driving this growth. We think it's sustainable. We think a double-digit outlook on the biopharma portion of Agilent's business is quite reasonable. We're really excited, and it's an investment priority for us. Yes, thanks Tycho. So, my comments come back from my first year as a CEO when I tried to call the trend of the C&E business, and eventually it turned out I think it was all by several quarters. So I learned my lesson, so to speak. So as Bob mentioned, one quarter trend does not make but we're very encouraged by that, because it's the first time we've seen some growth after those two double-digit declines earlier this year. And we look at a couple of things, Tycho one is the PMIs and the positive moves in the PMIs are indicative of improved end market strength, particularly in C&E, we also look at what we estimate to be the age of the installed base, because a lot of aged equipment out there, and that's been probably at very high levels, and then we look at the deal flow. So, kind of all those factors, the macro outlook from PMIs what we know to be the current environment for customers in terms of the age of their installed base, and then also overseen in our funnels, and you know, Agilent has a real strength in this market. So I think we will benefit from returned to growth, again we're not ready yet to put it into numbers for Q1 in the full-year, but we're hopeful that that trend will continue. There're some indications that it could, but let's give it another quarter or so. Yes, no, Tycho really appreciate you asking that question because not at all, I mean, this has been a continuing steady flow of business. We think the end markets are really strong here. We see a lot of strength in China Government funding to make sure they stimulate the economy, and then we talked earlier about just overall their investments in improving the quality of life, you noticed the strong growth in the food market, continued strength in pharma. So no, we've seen this. Now, I think we really look closely at the pacing and it's all nothing unusual. You're quite welcome, Tycho. Sure. Happy to see you, Brandon. So, one of the reasons why we were able to reinstate guidance this year was what we saw in the LSAG order book, and as you know, we stopped a few years ago talking about specifics around orders, but I think in today's call, it's really prudent for us to give you a sense of why Bob and I have this confidence around the outlook. So we didn't guessed as we ran across the finish line for 2020, order book was strong in LSAG and as continued into the fairly few weeks of this year. So again, all the other caveats aside being prudent and recognition of the virus, we feel pretty good about our ability to reinstate guideline because as we mentioned earlier reinstate guidance as mentioned earlier, LSAG was one where we hit the most early on the year, and I think we're feeling pretty good about that. And Bob, as I recall, most of the gross margin is really just a mix of the various instrument platforms. Yes, Brandon, just one additional thought here which is, we've seen a real change in the price environment. So, that's why we can say pretty common that has happened to be the mix product this quarter. You're welcome. Thanks, Dan. Good evening, Doug. Hi, Doug really appreciate the opportunity to have Jacob comment more deeply on that, but as you know, I highlighted that in my script, we were able to call out that double-digit growth. We're extremely proud of that. And Jacob, I think you've got some additional insights that you could share with Doug. Hi, Derik. Yes. What I would say Doug, excuse me, Derik, is that we feel very good about our competitive positioning with OpenLab and the rest of our products. Hello, Jack. Jack, great question. So, to our delight, it really hasn't seen them cause any kind of material shift. I mean, we're seeing -- in fact, I think Bob in his script, where we saw strength across small molecule and bio -- large molecule. Now the small molecule is not growing as fast as large molecules, it was growing, and\u2026 Bob, as I recall, and I'd like Padraig on this, I think it was broad-based across all end-markets. Everything was in that double-digit range, and Padraig anything you could add to that? Hi, Patrick. Yes, I think that sort of all the kind of this always helpful reminder, but in a kind of our mix, so it's 70:30, 70:30 in chemicals and materials, and 30% energy. Actually the upside on the chemical and material, energy lags, and we aren't really seeing a lot of indications of why that would, that would pick up, but you have to remember some of the chemical companies are actually providing products and such into end markets that support COVID-19. They're feeling, what drives this marketplace? Yes, we talked about PMIs, but really all the PMIs are really related to the view of global growth, and I think that customer base is feeling more confident about where the economy is going and things this shut really slowed down earlier this year just for a must kind of purchases, but I think it's a prove view of the overall economic outlook for the chemical and materials side plus the fact that they have some kind of COVID-19 tailwind to help out. I wouldn't say that's the entire story is just the element of it. I think the biggest part here is just the fact that there's much more common in the customer base about the growth environment from an economic standpoint, Bob anything you would add to that? No, no we continue to be very interested in deploying capital for growth standpoint along all the dimensions we talked about earlier. We said that the BioTek size deal, which we were really quite happy with that, that was largest deal we've done to-date. That doesn't mean that would be the largest deal we would do. We've always said, I think it was not magnitudes of delta, and although we didn't closed any deals this year, I think that really was somewhat tied into some of the COVID-19 challenges of doing due diligence and working with potential targets, but we still see this as a key part of our, what we call, our build and buy growth strategy, and think that M&A can be a nice attitude to our core growth businesses. So you guessed right, so we'll talk more about it in a few weeks. We still have aspirations in the space, but really sticking to the model, the framework that we've been using before, which is M&A in markets at a higher growth investor company that aligns strategically with us where they can benefit by our scale and are accretive to the P&L. Okay, I'll be giving easy one. Okay. Yes, thanks, Steve. So, in regards to the first one, we probably talked about the flight to quality when money is tight, but we also think tied it to stability, and how we protected our overall field team and our ability to support our customers during the pandemic. So, I think those two things are going to carry us forward. So we think that the stickiness will remain there, and I don't think that the quality will fall out of fashion, and I think as you continue to grow your position in the installed base, it just gives you an upper hand in terms of next buy when they get around to making the next capital purchasing decision. We think [some things] [ph] are going to stick. Particularly, as it relates to your digital engagement with customers, because there's a huge element of being responsive, and we think that digital cable is a big part of that story, and yes, it has been accelerated by COVID, but we don't think there's any going back either. You're quite welcome."

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional revenue detail, and take you through the fourth quarter income statement, and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021, and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter results as we saw strong growth exceeding our expectations, especially considering the ongoing challenges associated with COVID-19. For the quarter, revenue was $1.48 billion, reflecting core revenue growth of 5.6%. Reported growth was stronger, at 8.5%, currency contributed 1.7%, while M&A added 1.2 points of growth. From an end market perspective, pharma, our largest market, showed strength across all regions, and delivered 12% growth in the quarter. Both small and large molecule businesses grew, with large molecule posting strong double-digit growth. We continue to invest and build capabilities in faster growth biopharma markets, and offer leading solutions across both small and large molecule applications. The food market also experienced double-digit growth during the quarter, positing a 16% increase in revenue. While our growth in food business was broad-based, China led the way. And as Mike noted earlier, our chemical and energy market exceeded our expectations growing 3% after two quarters of double-digit declines. Well, one quarter does not a trend make, we are certainly pleased with this result, and the growth came primarily from the chemical and materials segment. Diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 1% during Q4 led by recovery in the U.S. and Europe. We continue to see recovery in non-COVID '19 testing as expected, although the levels that are still slightly below pre-COVID levels. Academia and government was flat to last year, continuing the steady improvement in this market, and revenue in the environmental and forensics market declined mid single-digits against a strong comparison to last year. On a geographic basis, all regions returned to growth. China continues to lead our results with broad based growth across most end markets. For the quarter, China finished with 13% growth, and ended the full-year up 7% just a great result from our team in China. The Americas delivered a strong performance during the quarter, growing 5% with results driven by large pharma food and chemical and energy, and in Europe, we grew 2% as we saw lab activity improved sequentially benefiting from our on-demand service business in ACG, as well as from a rebound in pathology and genomics as elective procedures and screening started to resume. However, while improving CapEx demand still lags are servicing consumables business. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, fourth quarter gross margin was 55%. This was down 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily by a shift in revenue mix and an unfavorable impact of FX on margin. In terms of operating margin, our fourth quarter margin was 24.9%. This is down 20 basis points from Q4 of last year. As we made some incremental growth focused investments in marketing and R&D, which we expect to benefit us in the coming year. The quarter also capped off with full-year operating margin of 23.5%, an increase of 20 basis points over fiscal 2019. Now wrapping up the income statement, our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in at $0.98, up 10% versus last year. Our full-year earnings per share of $3.28 increased 5%. In addition, our operating cash flow continues to be strong. In Q4, we had operating cash flow of $377 million, but more than $60 million over last year, and in Q4, we continued our balanced capital approach to repurchasing $2.48 million shares for $250 million. For the year, we repurchased just over 5.2 million shares for $469 million, and ended the fiscal year in a strong financial position with $1.4 billion in cash and just under $2.4 billion in debt; all-in-all, a very good end to the year. Now let's move on to our outlook for the 2021 fiscal year. We and our customers have been dealing with COVID-19 for nearly a full-year and are seeing our end markets recover. Visibility into the business cadence is improving, and as a result, we're initiating guidance for 2021. There is still a greater than usual level of uncertainty in the marketplace across most regions and so while we're providing guidance, we're doing so with a wider range than we have provided historically. It is with this perspective that we're taking a positive, but prudent view of Q1 in the coming year. For the full-year, we're expecting revenue to range between $5.6 billion and $5.7 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 7% in core growth of 4% to 6%. This range takes into account the steady macro environment we're seeing. It does not contemplate any business disruptions caused by extended shutdowns like we saw in the first half of this year. In addition, we're expecting all three of our businesses to grow led by DGG. We expect DDG to grow high single-digits with the continued contribution of NASD ramp and the recovery in cancer diagnostics. We believe ACG will return to its historical high single-digit growth, while LSAG is expected to grow low to mid single-digits. We expect operating margin expansion of 50 to 70 basis points for the year, as we absorbed the build-out costs of the second line and our Frederick Colorado NASD site, and then helping you build out your models, we're planning for a tax rate of 14.75%, which is based on current tax policies, and 309 million of fully diluted shares outstanding, and this includes only anti-dilutive share buybacks. All this translates to a fiscal year 2021 non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $3.57, and $3.67 per share, resulting in double-digit growth at the midpoint. Finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion to $1.05 billion and an increase in capital expenditures to $200 million, driven by our NASD expansion. We have also announced raising our dividend by 8%, continuing an important streak of dividend increases, providing another source of value to our shareholders. Now, let's finish with our first quarter guidance, but before we get into the specifics, some additional context. Many places around the world are currently seeing renewed spikes in COVID-19 that could cause some additional economic uncertainty, and while we're extremely pleased with the momentum we have built during Q4, we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook for Q1 because of the current situation with the pandemic. For Q1, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.42 billion to $1.43 billion, representing recorded growth of 4.5% to 5.5%, and core growth of 3.5% to 4.5% and first quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.88 per share. Before opening the call for questions, I want to conclude by echoing Mike's comments about the amazing work the Agilent team performed during fiscal 2020. To be where we are now, after knowing where we stood in March, is truly remarkable. Add to this the strong momentum we saw in Q4, I truly believe we are well-positioned to accelerate our growth in fiscal 2021. With that, Ankur, back to you for Q&A. Yes, Vijay, I think a couple of things, you know, the thing that I would say is we didn't end the year with emptying the tank out, and feel really good about that, but that being said, we do have some business that is somewhat susceptible to some of these areas, and so we probably have greater visibility or variability in some of our diagnostics businesses. So, as Mike said, we're taking kind of prudent approach there, and the other area is we want to see more than just one quarter in the chemical and energy business. I think that's one of the areas where I think -- we think we're biased to the upside and the way we're kind of thinking about the business, but it's certainly with a recovery. We do expect some COVID tailwinds, to your point. It's probably on the order of roughly about one-and-a-half to two points, kind of consistent with what we've seen in the last -- the last several quarters. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Yes, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to build on that, what Mike talked about, the beauty of that business is it continues to accelerate throughout the year, and that 40% -- that roughly 40% in Q4 was the highest it was all year, and that team has done just a fantastic job of scaling that business, and we're not done, and as Mike said, we're making incremental investments in building out that capacity, which we'll continue to make throughout the course of next year. That is probably about a 20 basis point headwind next year and in the operating margin just rough numbers there, Vijay, but extremely pleased with the work that that team has been able to do, and continuing to drive that growth, and so we feel very good about that business. Yes, that's a great question, Puneet, and as you accurately state, our expectation is the impact is going to be much less this year than it was last year for all the things that you just talked about, less travel, timing of when it is, and so forth, relative to Q1, and what we're seeing is actually very strong continued recovery and performance in our China business, and I would say that there's -- Q1 is no different, and so, the story there certainly remains in tact, and I would expect it to be very strong performance in Q1. I think what we're trying to do is there's nothing in particular, but I think we're just probably taking a little more prudent approach in Europe, and as we're seeing some of the shutdowns, particularly in some of these areas. And I think as we look at where are the things that could potentially be upsides or downsides, I think that continued recovery in chemical and energy across the business, also continued performance in Americas. We're expecting kind of an average budget flush, so to speak. That's another question that's probably -- if people are thinking about by -- for the end of the year and both of those things could be better than expected. Yes, and Tycho, maybe if I can add to Mike's point, in terms of -- because it's not only the platforms in the portfolio that we have on the instrument basis, which we've been making some heavy investments in, but it's also been the informatics and the software piece, which is has allowed us to be able to kind of plug in to the labs, the analytical labs, and then you bring in the ACG services portfolio that helped them manage the labs, and particularly with everything that's going on right now, the last thing they want is their scientists to be managing the instrumentation. They want them to be doing the science, and so, we think we've got a very compelling software and tools offering, and I think it's showing up in the marketplace across multiple technology platforms really. Yes, Tycho, I think we've been extraordinarily pleased with the way our China businesses performed throughout the course of this year, and when you think about kind of our cadence through Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, we've seen accelerated growth. So we saw our lowest growth in the first quarter where we saw the impact of COVID-19, but then what we've seen is improvements as opposed to this real huge increase, and then kind of a drop-off. So, we're not expecting any drop-off, and we haven't seen that in our order book or any of the conversations that we've had with our customers that there was sort of a material catch-up. Yes, that's right. I mean, I think Brandon, to read what Mike is saying, I mean we feel very good, orders exceeded revenue and exceeded our expectations, and so, it was a bit of a mix shift that is impacting that, but we would expect that to kind of normalize out throughout the course of next year, and so, we feel very good about kind of where that business is going into 2021. Yes, it was roughly about 40-ish, 45-ish on the COGS line, and some of that was offset through the bottom line, and for next year less impactful, much less impactful than that, probably less than about 10 points, 10 basis points. Yes, so by at the highest level, we're expecting steady improvement throughout the course of the year from the standpoint of the economic perspective, if I think about it from a geography first, China's going to lead the way with high single-digit growth continuing the momentum that we've seen, we ended this year FY '20 about 7%, and we're expecting that or better into next year, and then what you would see as a recovery in the Americas getting back to kind of mid to high single-digits, and then followed by Europe, which would be kind of the low to mid single-digits. So that's kind of on an end market perspective, how we would think about it, it's predicated on that continued recovery, and that we would as I mentioned before, not have any extended periods of shutdown that would disrupt business. I think the good thing is what we're seeing not only ourselves, but our customers are being able to operate in a different environment than they had the first time these were shut down. So we're not expecting any material impact there, and from an end-market perspective, the strength is really going to be the continued strength that we've seen in the last several years really driven behind our pharma business, which is probably high single-digits with biopharma as one of the earlier questions came out, probably growing double-digits going forward. And then food, we'll probably expect maybe a little tempering, where it'd be great to have 16% every quarter, but we're not ready to put that into our plan, but I would expect continued recovery there probably in the mid-single-digits and also recovery in our diagnostics and clinical business, particularly in that same kind of mid-single-digits, and probably ramping throughout the course of the year, probably more muted on the academia, and government probably flattish to low, and as we talked about before chemical and energy flattish, but that's really one where we're hoping that we're biased, and there's more upside than downside here, but certainly given the momentum, but one quarter is too early to put a forecast on there, and so, we're assuming roughly flat and then probably recovery in the environmental and forensics market low-single-digits. Yes, I'd say it's continued momentum, but I think that there's probably more upsides and downsides in the way that we're trying to capture that certainly exiting at a 6% growth rate, there are we're probably the biggest areas are around chemical and energy and the pace of recovery in academia and government, and if those continue, I would say - let me put it this way, if chemical and energy continued at 3% and growing, we'll be that number. Yes, so China, high single-digits, maybe low double-digits based on the range that we gave you in terms of COVID what I would say is, we are expecting less incremental the growth, but certainly the things that you talked about are baked into our guidance. So more serology our antigen based testing or even vaccine driven volume is not fully baked into the numbers that we are -- it's just too early to tell, but those are certainly be things that are potential upsides, and then the last one, I know which was your second question around gross margin, I would expect it to stabilize and not see this the same level of decline. Now, what I would say is you will have some mix shifts, right, because our ACG business, which is lower gross margin than the instrument business, but much higher operating margin helps us with that. So, you do see a dampening effect on the gross margin side, but you will more than make up for it on the operating margin side. Doug specific to COVID-19 we'll hit a little bit more of that when we have our Analyst Day, but we are planning to launch in early 2021 our serology test, and there are some things that we're working on that aren't baked into the guide. We'll see how that they play out. Same to you. Hi, Derik. Yes, actually a great question because we didn't highlight that, but actually when you look at sequential performance, that was one of the things that was very, very positive in the DDG business. It recovered very nicely into Q4, and maybe I'll let Sam talk about some of the details there. Yes, that'd be slightly better than where it is this year. Yes, Jack to give you some numbers, I mean for Q4 small molecule grew high single-digits, and for the year it grew low single-digits. So despite all the hoopla, small molecule is not dead. Thank you, Mike. I don't. Yes, I would say Patrick, just to build on what Mike was saying. I mean, we feel very good about the acquisitions that we made, the last two which was BioTek and ACEA were probably the fastest growing parts of our business, if you take out NASD, and so, I think it validates the space that we're looking at, and we don't see a reason to need to change our M&A framework. Yes, I would agree with that, Mike, and I think that, you know, I think two things; one is, we were there when the customers needed us the most, and our team particularly in the field, helping support critical operations and so forth, and that flight to quality on the instrumentation side only pays dividends going forward. So, I think there is no -- there will be no follow-up there, I truly believe that. On the cost side, we're still working through some of those things, a big thing, probably the biggest variable here, and it's got a couple of different tentacles to it would be around travel, and I think we had talked about before at one point in time we're spending roughly $10 million a month in travel, and that that is down, I would say substantially, and our goal is that will be back to $10 million a month, and so, that doesn't say that we're going to necessarily drop it all to the bottom line, but reinvest in some areas that will drive growth going forward, but certainly those, and then there will be more efficient ways of doing things like marketing outreach to our customers, and even operating, one of the things is we still operated and launched new products, despite not having been in the labs for the most part for nine months out of the year, and so, our teams are finding innovative ways to continue to actually move things around without having to spend incremental dollars, so more to come on that."

The Agilent team delivered excellent results in the third quarter in the midst of a historic global pandemic. Against this backdrop, Agilent's performance once again highlights the strength and resiliency of our team and our business. Agilent's Q3 revenues are $1.26 billion. Our revenues are down just 1% on a reported basis, despite COVID-19 headwinds in what we expect to be the year's most challenging quarter. On a core basis, revenues are down 3%. These results demonstrate the strong resilience we have built into our business over the past several years. EPS is $0.78 per share. This is a 3% year-over-year increase. Operating margin grew 90 basis points over last year to 23.7%. Our Q3 results are further evidence of the success of our profitable build-and-by growth strategy. We continue to build a more resilient growth oriented business. Last quarter, I talked to you about the four key priorities we're focused on during the COVID-19 pandemic: Protecting our people; being open for business for our customers; taking decisive action to deliver our P&L and balance sheet; and unwavering commitment to growth. Staying focused on these priorities has helped us navigate through the COVID-19 effects on our team, customers and business. Our customers continue to respond very favorably to our team's engagement and enhanced digital capabilities. In fact, Q3 customer satisfaction rankings are at all-time highs. In all regions, we're seeing improvement in lab access for our customers and increase non-COVID-19 testing volumes. There are, however, regional and end-market differences in the pacing of improvement. Labs access improved through the quarter, although still not at pre-COVID-19 levels. Globally, lab access remains limited in academia, non-COVID-19 research and testing labs. We're also seeing continued limited access at some private sector research labs in Europe and United States. Similarly, non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing volumes improved throughout the quarter, but remained down from prior levels. Hospital access in Europe and the U.S. is improving, although disrupted at times by virus flare up. While there are indications of improvement in economic growth at varying degrees across the globe, caution remains at customer capital expenditure decisions. Consistent with our thinking coming into the quarter, the pace of recovery varied by region. As expected, China led the way for us and exceeded our expectations with revenues up 11%. China's growth in the quarter is broad-based across all end market and for all business groups. While improving the rate of recovery in Europe, and the Americas lags China, given the timing when these reasons first felt the brunt of the pandemic, European revenues are down 5%. Americas market conditions trailed both China and Europe with revenues declining 10%. However, as we exited the quarter, we are seeing signs of improvement in service activity, consumables and diagnostic testing volumes. On a total Company basis, we exited July with modest growth across all major markets. Now, let's talk about our performance by business groups. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group grew 2% on a reported basis and declined 4%. Our team is focused and determined to gain market share despite a constrained capital environment. The strength of our portfolio coupled with an energized and stable sales team is paying dividends. I'm also very proud of contributions are selling our cell analysis technologies are making in COVID-19 virus research. Our M&A strategy is working and making a difference in the pandemic fight. Our CrossLab Group revenues grew 1%. Increase in customer activity led to increased sales of consumables and an uptake of on-demand services. The CrossLab team continues to win large, multiyear contracts for enterprise laboratory management that will benefit us moving forward. We will continue to increase our competitiveness in this space. Our Diagnostics and Genomics Group revenues declined 8%. While our overall pathology and genomics businesses are down for the quarter, we did see gradual improvement in diagnostic testing volumes and non-COVID-19 lab openings. Partially offsetting this, our nucleic acid solution business delivered another strong quarter, growing almost 25%. We are very excited about the future of our NASD business. As we announced earlier today, we plan to more than double oligo manufacturing capacity and our new Frederick, Colorado site. This expansion helps us meet significantly increasing customer demand. We are growing double-digit and expect to continue this rate of growth in the coming years. We continue to advance in our portfolio across all our businesses. Highlights during the quarter included LSAG launching two new LC/MS products in Agilent 6470B Triple Quad and the Agilent RapidFire 400 systems. Both products are in high throughput labs, driving productivity and superior resolution. We launched our CrossLab Asset Monitoring service, which is a new subscription service using instrument sensor technologies to provide data driven usage insights. This helps drive improved customer economics and lab productivity. While early, we are seeing strong interest from customers in this service. During the quarter, our PD-L1 assay was approved by the FDA for expanded use of non-small cell lung cancer, helping guide physicians in selecting treatments using specific immunotherapies. Our team is very proud of the role their company is playing in the global COVID-19 play. We are supporting COVID-19 research, testing and therapeutic of vaccine development. Our efforts in the global fight against the virus delivered 2 percentage points of reported growth. We are accelerating efforts to make a difference in the battle against COVID-19 and have mobilized across Agilent team to maximize customer support. Let me close with few comments on our outlook in the coming quarter. While there's still significant uncertainty regarding the continued pace of recovery, we expect the July trend of gradual improvement in our business to continue into Q4. By region, China will continue to be a positive story for us and lead return to growth. Europe is starting to trend upward. The Americas are also expected to improve but at lower rate than China and Europe. Globally, improved lab access, increasing non-COVID-19 testing and a slowly recovering global economy are all positive signs. I remain absolutely convinced Agilent will emerge from this pandemic with a stronger position in the marketplace. Our continued focus action on four priorities, protect the team; support our customers; preserve our P&L and balance sheet; and our unwavering investment in growth are delivering. Entering Q4, we are operating from a position of strength and with momentum. Yes, this pandemic remains unpredictable. However, I am cautiously optimistic about our continued gradual recovery and return to growth. Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'd like to pause and share my hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. Thanks for being on the call. I look forward to taking your question after Bob's remarks. And now, Bob, over to you.\nBob McMahon: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the third quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. And then, I'll finish up with a framework for thinking about Q4. As with last quarter, there are still too many unknowns. So, we're not going to provide formal forward-looking guidance today. However, we will provide a framework for how we see things potentially playing out in Q4. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike mentioned, our revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, down 1% on a reported basis. On a core basis, revenue declined 3.1% in the quarter, currency negatively affected revenue by 1.3 percentage points, while acquisitions added 3.4 percentage points to growth. As Mike talked about the regional performance, I'll speak to the end-market performance. In terms of our end markets, pharma grew 2% in Q3 against a very strong comparison of 13% from last year. Both, small and large molecule applications grew and biopharma improved throughout the quarter as drug development labs increased production and access. We experienced softness in diagnostics and clinical, as anticipated. Revenues declined 10%, primarily due to conditions in the U.S., driven by COVID-19-related disruptions to patient visits and diagnostic lab opportunities. Encouragingly, we did see an improvement in routine testing throughout the quarter, especially in China and Europe, while the U.S. lagged. Chemical and energy was down 10%, consistent with our thinking. Revenues were generally flat sequentially with conditions largely similar to what we saw in Q2. As we've talked about previously, we expect this segment to ramp more slowly than others. The food segment was a bright spot, up 8%. We're seeing ongoing signals that the market in China has stabilized with the transition of more testing by commercial labs. The food market was just one of several bright spots that contributed to double-digit growth in China, including growth in the low-teens for our pharma business. Our environmental and forensics business declined mid-single-digits against the double-digit compare and the academic and government segments declined mid-single-digits, while improving on a sequential basis in Q3. Strength in cell analysis and liquid handling for viral research partially offset the widespread impact of the ongoing academic lab closes. Now, let's turn to the rest of the P&L. I'm extremely proud of how the Agilent team has responded to the challenging environment. During the quarter, we continued our focus on managing expenses, while ensuring we continue to invest in our key growth opportunities. These expense management actions we initiated last quarter were on full display in Q3. In addition, our customer engagement model using digital tools continued to gain traction, while also delivering savings in SG&A. As a result, operating margins of 23.7% improved 90 basis points over last year on declining revenues. Gross margin at 55.1% was down 130 basis points versus the prior year, largely due to mix, and higher logistics costs. However, strong cost management and operating expenses more than offset the decline in gross margin. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.78 per share, up nearly 3% from the number we posted a year ago. From a balance sheet perspective, we generated $290 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is $48 million improvement over last year. In terms of capital spending, we spent $25 million, lower than last year and in line with our revised look in Q2. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.3 billion in available liquidity, including $1.36 billion in cash. Also during the quarter, we took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced $0.5 billion in short-term debt with a 10-year bond and a 2.1% coupon, the lowest coupon in our portfolio. As you know, we paused share buybacks in Q2, pending improvement in business conditions. In Q3, our visibility into business trends and cash flow improved, and we resumed anti-dilutive share repurchases late in the quarter. In the quarter, in total, we repurchase 360,000 shares for $33 million. Going forward, we intend to resume our normal pattern of regular anti-dilutive repurchases, along with additional opportunistic buying. Our overall capital deployment approach remains balanced with the primary focus on growth M&A opportunities, while also returning the cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. As we look to Q4, business and trends have gradually improved, but significant uncertainty remains around the evolution of this pandemic. However, let me provide a framework for how we see a range of possible revenue growth scenarios in the coming quarter. We generally expected trajectory of gradual improvement in business results to continue across all regions. Areas where we see a broader range of scenarios include research spending, both in academia and other markets, non-COVID diagnostic testing, especially in the U.S., and the general CapEx environment. The combination of these factors could result in scenarios where our revenue performance could range from a 4% decline to 1% core growth. Also, as a reminder, the BioTek acquisition closed midway through Q4 of last year. So, the M&A impact in Q4 will be smaller than in previous quarters, roughly 1 point growth and currency is forecasted to be positive in the quarter. The low end of this range envisions COVID-19 flare-ups occurring in the fall in various geographies, limiting and in some cases, reversing the recovery gains we've seen in a period of time. In this scenario, one might expect to see slower or stalled improvements in research, academia and other markets as continued tight cash management leading to lower CapEx spending in the U.S. and Europe. We hope this bottom end of the range is overly conservative, but we wanted to let you know, we have plans in place in case this happens. The higher end of the range assumes continued recovery by region, building on what we have seen in July, with the biggest impact coming from the U.S. This would include a continual increase in elective medical procedures such as cancer screenings, as well as continued lab openings. This view would also include continued China momentum, along with the continued improvement in Europe and other areas in the Americas. Again, this is not guidance, but should provide a sense for some of the variables we see for Q4. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy continues its path to recovery. With that, I'll turn over things to Ankur to direct the Q&A. Ankur?\nAnkur Dhingra: Thanks, Bob. Robert, if you can provide the instructions for the Q&A, please?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.\nMike McMullen: Hey, Doug. How are you doing?\nDoug Schenkel: I\u2019m doing well. Nice work in a tough environment. Can we maybe just start with a clean-up question right off the bat which is just about the prepared remarks. I don't think you quantified COVID-19 tailwinds in the quarter. Again, I may have missed that. But, it just would be helpful to get that so we could try to normalize there?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Sure, Doug. I touched on it briefly in my comments. So, there's two points of reported growth in Q3.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. That\u2019s great. And then, on China, just a couple, I'm just curious if you would share the exit rate. And as we look ahead, I know you're not guiding, I'm just wondering if you think based on what you're seeing, if you think that double-digit growth can be sustained, from here, at least a term. And then, specific on food, it\u2019s great to see it return to solid quarter first time [Technical Difficulty] seeing some stabilization last quarter. Can the high-single-digit growth rate you saw this quarter be sustained moving forward, given favorable multiyear comparisons? Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Hey Doug. Thanks for those questions. So, just to make sure it came through the audience. The question was about our view on the growth rate of China for the rest of the year as well as can that high-single-digit growth rate in food be sustained. We think the answer is yes on both. We're really pleased with our performance in China. It was broad based. I tried to really accentuate that in my comments. We saw basically double-digit growth across all end markets in China. And we think that a double-digit growth rate is within the realm of possibility for Q4 in China. And I have to say, Doug, it's wonderful we talking about China food from a different vector. We've been talking about it probably last 18, 24 months of one that will return to growth. We saw some early indications in Q2, we saw strong Q3, and we think that are all numbers probably sustainable for the rest of this year. Want to say something, Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes. I would just say, Doug, to add, I mean, one of the things that was very positive about China was it was pretty consistent across the quarter, and in fact exited slightly higher than that overall 11%, but we saw solid growth all three months.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Mike or Bob, just maybe on the guidance here. If I step back, the third quarter guidance, down mid-single to down mid-teens, this down low-single was up, came well above expectations I would say, perhaps not surprising than peers, but nonetheless solid execution. Maybe Q4, down 4 to plus 1 implies declines. What\u2019s the cause of declines, just given in light of performance? Is that that the minus 4 at the low end, is that assuming that Life Sciences [Technical Difficulty]?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Vijay, this is Bob. I'll take that. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we hope that that is overly conservative. What that would imply is actually a retrenchment -- and in COVID-19 flare-ups here in the U.S. as we go back -- as we move into the fall, and you start seeing some elements of shutdown. So, we certainly would hope that we would do better than that. But, we wanted to provide, hey, that's within the realm of kind of how we're thinking about our spending and so forth. Our July results -- or our exit rate of the quarter was much higher than that. And so, we're aiming to do better. But there's still uncertainty in the world with the pandemic, people going back to school and so forth, so.\nMike McMullen: And Bob, I think it\u2019s probably fair to say, the wildcard is United States, right?\nBob McMahon: Yes, absolutely.\nMike McMullen: And we were encouraged by the movement in PMIs. You probably noticed that. But, let's see how that translates into business in the coming quarter. And again, we have to keep in mind ourselves, as pleased as we are with the result we just delivered, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there because the virus is unpredictable at times.\nBob McMahon: Yes. That's right, Mike. I mean, if you looked at each one of the major markets, each one of the major markets got better in Q3 versus Q2 with the exception of the U.S., which we expected given kind of the state of affairs with the pandemic.\nVijay Kumar: That helpful perspective. So, the minus 4 implies that things get worse. Was July flattish or positive? And I'm curious Mike that you mentioned NASD doubling up a while ago. I know, if you turn back the page, we were doubling capacity. So, is this now versus six months of a quadrupling capacity versus where we were last year? Is that the right way to think about the revenues going from 100, 200 to perhaps, is that the math here?\nBob McMahon: No, it's slightly different math. I think, we've been consistent with our view of needing to double our capacity. What we ended up doing is actually triggering the decision to initiate expansion earlier than we thought, just given the robust nature of the end market. And as well as we have worked our way to be able to -- in the same space, we challenged ourselves to find ways to drive as much revenue in the same physical space. So, we are investing a little bit more capital than we initially thought. But, we're also building something slightly different than our first train, which is going to give us actually more volume than our current train A. So, it's a really -- we thought it was really positive signal. And that\u2019s why sent out the press release this morning, because we're super excited about our prospects here.\nMike McMullen: Yes. And Vijay, let me kind of frame into kind of the numbers. What we were talking about is the Frederick site has the potential of roughly $100 million worth of revenue. And we added capacity that more than doubles that $100 million to give you a frame of the numbers. So, it's not 100, 200, 400, it's 100, 200 and more than 300 to kind of give you a sense. And in terms of July, we actually came in with growth across all three groups in exiting in July.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: I\u2019ll start with the COVID commentary. I guess, if I go back to last quarter, there was some talk about launching the serology test. You guys obviously have an installed base of real-time PCR instruments. We've got the questions that why you haven\u2019t launched a PCR test. So, can you just talk a little bit about, how you think about those tailwinds going forward and how you think about your capabilities on diagnostics side?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Tycho, I'll make some initial comments and then the group presidents are kind of quiet today. So, I\u2019ll pull Sam in here as well, to provide his perspective. But, we think that there's still tailwinds in front of us and now two points of growth, and we think we can sustain that at a minimum. That's why I tried to put fairly bullish comments about our stepped up efforts across the Company. Some of these things are going to take a little bit longer. We think there's still room for our own test of quality tests with some different features. But, I think maybe a few comments there, Sam, from your perspective?\nSam Raha: Yes. Sure, Mike. Hi, Tycho. As you -- I think you\u2019d have seen a good pickup in terms of our qPCR instruments, which are our Aria systems, as well as our bioreagents related to qPCR both reverse transcriptase master mixes. On the antibody side, we\u2019ve definitely also seen an increase in IgA, IgG and those antibodies. In terms of our own tests, we are very actively exploring the possibilities of developing those. So, more to share in due course.\nMike McMullen: And Tycho, I guess, what I\u2019d just close off here is a broad-based nature of our portfolio is allowing us to play in multiple aspects of this COVID-19. Some of these things may take a little bit longer to actually turn into revenue, right? So, if you're working with, say, a pharma partner or something in the therapeutic area, it may take a while for that to come to market. So, we think these tailwinds are here to stay for some time. And we're stepping up our efforts here because it plays right into the broad nature of our portfolio.\nTycho Peterson: I guess, that's a good segue on the NASD expansion. Could you maybe draw to what degree that's tied to the COVID vaccine, and any updates from your add-on capabilities on APIs for mRNA or siRNA vaccines?\nMike McMullen: Do you want to take that one, Sam?\nSam Raha: Yes, sure. No problem. Tycho, I'd start by reiterating a little bit of what Mike and Bob were talking about. It's interesting that it was just last June that we did a ribbon cutting and starting of the new Frederick, Colorado facility. And quite frankly, we've seen demand that exceeded our expectations, just 12 months ago. So, building really -- sorry, the new manufacturing line that we're building, you can consider it, as we call it, training on steroids as our general. But, it is very-differentiated, both in throughput and the molecules it can do, which is a segue to your -- a little bit of your question that we're able to do multiple iterations or types of siRNA or RNA. We're also actively looking at other different versions of molecules that are oligo based. Though I can't reveal the details, we have had a lot of interest related to COVID-19, all of those used for either COVID-19-related therapeutics or even for vaccines. So, I can say that we have started to work on some of those programs now.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And maybe Sam to add. That being said, the capacity expansion isn't tied to COVID-19. We have plenty of demand outside of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. And so, this is a broad-based capacity expansion.\nTycho Peterson: And then, just last one, I know we don't have official guidance, but there's a framework for the quarter -- for the fourth quarter. As we think about C&E and then also pharma biotech, should we expect any kind of material change in either of those end markets for the coming quarter? I know, you talked about restoring activities for C&E. I wasn't sure if that was maybe a positive improvement in trajectory there?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Probably -- C&E is probably the one that's -- I would expect it to be pretty stable and that down 10ish percent -- 8% to 10% in that range. We do expect pharma to continue to improve. So that 2% certainly even in the low scenario would stay there and then on the high scenario would accelerate, which is consistent with the trends we've seen throughout the quarter of Q3.\nMike McMullen: And Tycho, the supply chain consideration and discussions still happen and it gets added a level of stability, albeit down to this -- into the space. And, again, as you look ahead for the future, this is an area where eventually it'll come back, and again, too early to call. But, I'd say we're pretty confident about the improvement rate in pharma.\nBob McMahon: Yes. The way to think about those reshoring is those are opportunities and discussions that could happen through the order book, and then will happen actually in '21 and beyond in terms of investments are being made. So, that's more future looking.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: So, first question is just on NASD, [ph] it\u2019s obviously strong in the quarter, but that would imply Dako and clinical business, obviously you pointed that out, it was down in the quarter. But that's a significant decline. Maybe just could you parse that out for us? What is -- it's the COVID impact, for sure, but is there anything beyond that in terms of the way market is fundamentally potentially shifting here to NGS maybe? And if you could just maybe elaborate a little bit of that, clarify? Thanks.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Happy to do so. So, it's all market, it\u2019s all access to labs and patients going for the diagnostic test. So, it's real all market. I think, we're seeing different pace of pacing throughout the quarter. All of our geographies in the diagnostic testing front ended up with positive growth in July, but it was down sharply in May and June, particularly in the U.S. And keep in mind also, we -- part of our business in our genomics front is so select into NGS-based diagnostic labs and for genetic disorders, for example, those tests aren't getting done either. So, it's really all market. \nBob McMahon: Yes. I was going to say, Puneet, actually if you bifurcate those two and look at our performance, actually, pathology performed better than NGS testing volumes, given what Mike was just talking about, as well as some of the academic institutions.\nMike McMullen: That's good point, Bob. Thanks.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Thanks for that. And if you could, I know you quantified it last quarter, Bravo contribution. I was wondering if you can provide that for Bravo Magnis liquid handling system, sort of how much of that contribution happened in the quarter?\nMike McMullen: Yes. That's part of the story for our COVID-19 tailwinds. And I think probably the biggest contribution this quarter actually came from BioTek, Bob, if I remember correctly?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Between BioTek and Bravo.\nMike McMullen: Bravo. So, it's kind of like, now we like a one-two punch kind of going there on the core instrumentation. I\u2019d also remind you, with the Bravo platform comes an ongoing revenue stream associated with the tips that go with those liquid handlers.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. And last one on just ACG. I mean, could you just elaborate on -- in these times, you mentioned, there are some larger contracts -- service contracts and likes that you\u2019re getting into. Sort of what are those sort of COVID-driven, what's behind those and maybe if you can elaborate on geography there?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Puneet, happy to have Padraig jumping on here and provide his perspective on that. So, Padraig, in the call script I talk a bit about the large enterprise deals you guys won. So, why don\u2019t you talk about that a little more detail?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, thanks, Mike. We launched our CrossLab Asset Monitoring service, which has seen a big uptick. And what we're seeing from customers is a large demand for sourcing from one vendor. And because of our capabilities in terms of the asset monitoring capability, relocation services and our core delivery services, which are extremely in strong demand. We're seeing a big uptick from large customers, and we expect that to continue as we go through the quarter, next quarter.\nMike McMullen: Yes. And I was going to say that I think the geography Puneet is largely in the U.S., but there are some global opportunities as well. It\u2019s really non-COVID-19 related. I mean, this is part of the core growth strategy for Padraig\u2019s business to continue to expand our market share on the Enterprise Services front. And we're really delighted that we made some big pharma deals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerik de Bruin: So, a couple of questions. Very impressive margin expansion in the third quarter. How should we think about the operating margin into Q4? And then, I guess, how much of these costs are permanent removals versus what has to come back in '21?\nBob McMahon: Let me take that, Derik. It's great question and we certainly are very pleased with how the team has responded, as I mentioned before. As we talked about, a large amount of the cost, we have not done things like furloughs. We stabilized the team. We have not reduced base pay and things like that. So, these are discretionary expenses that a lot of them we think had the opportunity to stay away, be travel and things like that, which our digital tools have enabled us to really continue to support our customers. And so, there aren't any kind of one time things that happened in the quarter.  In terms of going forward to Q4, we are looking at probably less of a margin -- incremental margin improvement because we are looking for ways to continue to invest to drive growth as the economy recovers. We also have some startup costs in the NASD new facility as well. So, it's probably less than what we've had historically had, which is call it 30% to 40% incremental. But it's really to drive growth.\nMike McMullen: Hey Bob, if I could maybe add a comment on your -- on the first remark. So, this is really, Derik, all about a new way of working in Agilent. So, I'm preparing for a manager's call later this week. And what we're talking to our team about is more digital, less travel. And we're really going to make sure that when we get on the other side of COVID-19 pandemic that we don't revert to our old ways of traveling. And we know from our customer satisfaction scores, they love the responses we have now with our digital platforms.\nDerik de Bruin: And two questions on LASG (sic) [LSAG]. I guess, the first question is, if you look at your numbers in China versus some of your major peers in that area, I mean, you really outshone in China. Can you just talk about just share dynamics there that are going on? I mean, as I said, there was a pretty stark comparison between you and your main LC competitor there. And I guess, also along those lines, can you talk about potentially any sign of a budget -- any sign of a budget flush into sort of thinking about 4Q trends? What are you hearing in terms of people with budgets? And are they going to be allowed to roll things over and to -- or are they going to have to use it or lose it? Just some dynamics in terms of growth on the fourth quarter and just sort of to your general thoughts on what customer spending habits are?\nMike McMullen: I'm going to have Jacob handle the first question. And Jacob, you can pass it back to Bob and I for the second question. And I know Jacob would be just delighted to talk about the share dynamics in China, which we think are very positive for Agilent?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Thanks for that. And the number speaks for itself. It's clear that both in China but I think actually globally that we right now will be taking care. And this doesn\u2019t come like coincidence. We have been executing our strategy to make a deal over the past year. And the customers are really buying into our value proposition. We are playing a game where we are leveraging our whole portfolio, not going after one product line versus each other and the customer really likes that we\u2019re outcome based. So that's what is happening right now. And we see here in the crisis that not only are they excited about the investments we have done over the past year, but also, as Mike talked about, in the digital world, into the work world, we have been very optimistic and super responsive they have taken off the digital, we take challenge variable very, very good and the customers responded very, very positive to it. They know that when they work with Agilent that we are there for them in this crisis.\nMike McMullen: And then, on the other question, Derek, what we're hearing from our customers, particularly in the public sector and we\u2019re seeing it in our order book, and while I'll offer my perspective here, and feel free to build on my comments here. But, there's a real sense of making sure they commit to the budgets. So, we're seeing it both in our order book as well as order activity, where there is a lot of uncertainty what's going to happen post elections as we go into 2021. So, they want to commit those funds. And it's actually quite amazing the amount of deal activity that's going to occur without visiting a customer face to face. So Bob, I don\u2019t know what you're hearing from field\u2026\nBob McMahon: The only thing I would add is just reiterate what Jacob was saying, because it's not just China. I think, when you look at our LSAG portfolio, I think what people don't fully appreciate is, is how we've actually changed the portfolio to technology platforms, they're probably the best -- in the best shape they have been in probably five years in terms of new products and so forth. And I think you're seeing that across the globe. And when we think about where we ended up in Q3, LSAG was certainly the standout relative to where we thought they were going to be. In a capital constrained environment only down 4% on a core basically speaks to our responsiveness to customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Couillard: Bob, on the gross margin line, you mentioned higher logistics cost in the third quarter. Is that a new trend? And then, could you help us just think through some of the puts and takes, whether it's logistics costs or mix and how those puts and takes might evolve in the fourth quarter?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Sure. We\u2019re hoping that's not a trend that's going to be around for a while, but it certainly was exacerbated in the Q3. That being said, I would say three quarters of that was probably mix, when you look at the various businesses across each one of the groups. But, where we saw logistics, challenges are, it's lower capacity and freight and air capacity. But we would expect that -- and we actually saw that through the quarter to kind of relax. And I think as you\u2019re starting to see more intercontinental travel, both from a passenger standpoint as well as freight standpoint we would expect that to kind of relax over time.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. And then, Bob or Mike, you're not quite giving formal forward-looking guidance yet, but you do feel comfortable enough to restart the buyback program. Just what are your latest thoughts just around comfort as far as capital deployment goes and maybe your appetite for M&A right now and what the funnel might look like there?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Sure, Brandon. And I'll start off here, and Bob, feel free to jump in. But, we felt quite comfortable resuming our share repurchase program on the non-dilutive perspective, and we'll be looking at opportunistic as well. And cash flow remains strong. We felt for some time that the third quarter of this year would be the toughest quarter for us for the year. We\u2019re through that now. And the third quarter actually was significantly better than we had thought. And we saw positive growth across all the businesses in July. So, we think, okay, barring some kind of major flare-up, we should be able to continue to see this gradual improvement of growth in the fourth quarter, sort of our message. So, we have the comp. We also narrowed the framework that we provided, it\u2019s more narrower than it was in Q3. But again, I think we need to keep in mind ourselves that we still -- there's still a lot of uncertainty associated with the pandemic. I think, our capital deployment approach remains unchanged, which is, we certainly wanted a balanced approach to capital deployment across dividends, cash, share repos and with the prioritization of investment in business, we just made a significant commitment in capital with our new NASD expansion. And we're still on the hunt for deals that make sense for Agilent. So, our approach to capital deployment really fundamentally remains unchanged. We paused a bit in the second quarter just because -- on the share repo because of the -- in the early part of the third quarter, given what was going on in the environment outside of Agilent. So, we feel pretty good about where we are right now and have a reasonable level of confidence, and there is decent level of stability about the business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDan Leonard: So, maybe just to circle back\u2026\nMike McMullen: Hey Dan.\nDan Leonard: Hi Mike. So, maybe this is a question for Bob, talking again about the Q4 framework. So, if your business grew in July and the world improves month to month through October, what does that imply then the high end should be above that 1% organic growth number?\nBob McMahon: It could be. I'll just leave it at that. There's still a lot of uncertainty and so forth. But certainly, we wouldn't complain if it was better than that.\nDan Leonard: Okay. And then, my follow-up, whoever wants to take it, on the NASD business. Can you elaborate on, what's the lead time for that announced expansion? Is it something that would take a year or multiple years to put in the new line, or is it a quicker turn? And can you comment on your willingness to commit capital inorganically in that business in addition to your organic commitments?\nBob McMahon: I'll take the first one just real quick. And then, Mike, if you want to add something on the second one. We announced that we would make that $150 million investment and we would expect it to go live towards the end of 2022. So, it's taking a little longer than just a regular train. Sam mentioned train A on steroids. So, it's bigger, and probably take a little more capital. And obviously with COVID-19 there's some activity there in terms of little long lead time. But, we feel like we have the capacity to be able to manage us through that time, and then that will come online at the end of 2020.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think, it\u2019s perhaps end of '22. And don\u2019t specifically talk about specific targets or areas of focus, certainly, but it's not out of the realm of reason that I would say, why wouldn\u2019t we want to further expand this business inorganically as well? So, that's not out of the realm. I'm not singling anything near-term happening. But we think we're operating from a position of strength here in this business. We had a first -- get our new factory up and running and build for that. So, we now think we have a, if you will, a beachhead to build from both, organically and inorganically.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open.\nCatherine Schulte: I guess, first, despite the relatively good LSAG results in the quarter, it sounds like the outlook on the capital equipment side is still a bit uncertain. Can you just talk to how the services and consumable side of the business trended in July, and what your expectations are for instrumentation trends in the coming quarters?\nBob McMahon: Yes. I think -- Catherine, this is Bob, all three of our businesses actually performed better in July than they did in May and June, which was very positive. The ACG business actually led the charge in terms of that, as you would expect, given the resumption of activities. There's some catch up there, in terms of -- we saw that kind of phenomenon actually in China, in April. But ultimately ACG was there. I think, LSAG capital is going to continue to be constrained. But I think what we've seen in our business is we've talked about this in the past kind of this flight to quality. And with our instrumentation and the reputation that we have, I think in a capital constrained environment, those dollars are precious. And we think our positioning is very good vis-\u00e0-vis the market.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I tried to hit that in my remarks, which as I really say, hey listen, we know we're picking up share in a tight market. And I think you saw that on C&E, right, which is if a C&E capital purchase is going down, it's coming Agilent\u2019s way. And that's why -- and the market is still cautious, but you see PMI starting to creep up a bit, so.\nBob McMahon: Yes, Catherine, just one last thing, to give you maybe a little more color. If we look across the groups, we would expect LSAG to still be negative in Q4. I mean, it's probably going to lag, given the [Multiple Speakers] big fourth quarter last year as well.\nCatherine Schulte: And then, Mike, you mentioned seeing growth in all regions for the non-COVID diagnostics business exiting the quarter. Can you just give us a sense of where those activity levels are in the U.S. versus China and where they bottomed out across the different regions?\nMike McMullen: Sure. So, I think, I\u2019d say China is in lead position in terms of if you -- almost full recovery. Europe is second and the U.S. is trailing. So for the first -- throughout the quarter, if I look at Sam's business in the U.S., for example, the first two months were negative of diagnostic testing values in pathology. But we saw actually improvement to growth in July. So, I think that's sort of the pattern of how the pandemic has flowed around the world. China is back. Europe's on its way. And I'd say, U.S. is still in the early stages of recovery.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And I would say, in the U.S. it\u2019s probably -- and keep me honest, Sam it\u2019s -- we're probably still at about 80% pre-COVID levels from a diagnostics perspective, but improving where it was. It was below that at the beginning of the quarter, so. Does that sound, Sam?\nSam Raha: It does.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Willoughby: Just one question for you. A lot of my other questions have already been answered. 90 days ago, you made a brief comment about potential onshoring back in the U.S. Just was wondering if there's any update on that at all?\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Steve. Happy to comment on that. I think, that's still going to happen. And these things take time. But, there's active discussion. And, by the way, I wouldn't say it's just confined I the United States. I mean, many geographies are now looking at the security of their supply chain, both in the pharma side as well as in the chemical marketplace where they're providing precursors into the APIs for the pharma chains. So, there's nothing significant to announce relative to the impact on business, but there does seem to be an overall trend in this regard. And I can say also from an Agilent perspective, we're working hard to make sure that our supply chain is secure as well. So, I think that the COVID-19 pandemic is a real wake up call to really some vulnerabilities in some aspects of supply chain. So, we're kind of working both sides of it, which are to ensure our own ability to deliver product under multiple scenarios, as well as we do see some market trends underway. Bob, I know you take a look at this pretty\u2026\nBob McMahon: Yes. Just to build on that, we talked a little bit about earlier in the call. We would expect that to see some of that opportunity show in our order book. And that's probably more a \u201821 timeframe for revenue. I wouldn't expect any of that to happen in Q4, just given the kind of timing. But you're seeing it in multiple end markets in multiple regions. We think this is a trend that will continue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Maybe first question just on chemical and energy, obviously, you've already highlighted a few comments throughout the call. But just wondering if you can kind of walk through a little more color separate trends within that segment by customer in chemical and if it's worth seeing if there's going to be divergence here between chemical and A&P and R&M? And then secondarily, maybe just remind us of how much of that business is tied towards like QA/QC versus R&D and kind of what are we looking for to determine whether or not this down 10% begins to improve more reliably, or if it's going to save the slow steady progress that you believe?\nMike McMullen: Hey, Bob, why don't I make some initial comments, and then we can check our notes to see if I missed anything. But, I think unlike the last quarter, the mix here -- and I think both the chemical and the energy later side had about the same dynamics where both were down about the same, primarily on the instrument side. And on one hand, the chemical side of the business was really benefiting -- continues benefit from the low oil prices. But, some of their end markets are weak, whether be automotive or some of the other markets that they service are weak. Some of them are getting a little bit of help on COVID-19 related products. But overall, I'd say both, the chemical side, as well as the energy side of that are down about the same, but stable. And I have to say that Bob and I had talked to at some length about this in our last call. And our prediction at the time was we thought we were going to be in a stable situation relative to this. That wasn\u2019t going to get any worse. That was sort of the question we were getting last call. So, I think we're really pleased to see that that came through this quarter. And we expect that eventually this thing will start to move back to grow. I think it's probably a 70-30 mix, where most of it\u2019s in QA/QC. And that's why these facilities are running, albeit maybe not at full volume. So, QA/QC equipment will be needed as well as consumer services that go with it. So, they can only hold off the depots on that side for so long. There is an element of research. But I think in the chemical and energy space, the biggest driver for that is the QA/QC side of the business.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And the only thing I\u2019d add, Dan is we would expect this, as you said, kind of steady slow progress going forward.\nDan Brennan: Okay. And then, maybe one different follow-up, I know -- a couple of questions on China. But maybe could you just go a little bit more into detail on what you saw in food and generics? Obviously COVID is impacting the globe and the recovery. But, you've got some pretty unique issues with food and generics that are maybe a little different. So, dependent upon the improvement or lack thereof, that could drive notable changes in China. So, what did you see there? And what's the outlook as we look forward to those segments?\nBob McMahon: Yes. I was going to say, Dan, one of the things we were incredibly proud of in China was all three of the business groups grew and all of our end markets grew, really led by food, which was up over 20%. It's been a while since we've been able to say that. And so, we think that -- we talked about kind of the moves away from the government labs or the central labs into the commercial labs, and we think that that's stabilized, and team has really been able to garner share, or our view of capacity in that space. And then, in pharma, it continues to perform very well. Actually, pharma was up roughly 10% in China, and that's a combination of both, large and small molecule. And I think that our thesis around that continues to play out, which is that the winners of the 4 plus 7 or the tendering process are -- customers that where we are over indexed, and we continue to see that positive momentum, we actually saw acceleration from Q2 to Q3 in both, food and pharma, and the rest of the businesses were positive as well. So, I think, it\u2019s broad-based.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Mike, maybe just one for you on -- I know, there\u2019s been a few questions in July obviously. But with all the businesses returning to growth, I guess, is it safe to assume you guys didn't see too much of a pullback around the second wave here in the U.S., even the first few weeks of August? It sounds like you're a little more cautious on Americas versus other geographies. But, just wondering, any surprises on an end market basis in the U.S., as you went through July and even early August, given the reoccurrence of virus?\nMike McMullen: No, I'll jump in on this. But from our perspective, I don't know real surprises. Maybe we're -- like all of us are watching what was happening with the pandemic as it worked its way across throughout the U.S. and we saw the case numbers go up and lab access was down really sharply April, May, June and we started seeing some recovery. So, I think no real surprises versus what we thought.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I would agree. I mean, Patrick, this is Bob. The Americas, as Mike said earlier, is in fact the biggest variable because it's further along in its recovery than both Europe and China. And I think, the thing that we're watching is those COVID flare-ups and the potential impact on elective procedures, which would impact our diagnostics business. That's probably got the biggest variability going into Q4 relative to LSAG and ACG. But, to Mike's point, we did not see any significant change with these flare-ups in August -- or excuse me in July and early August.\nPatrick Donnelly: And then, bunch of that good commentary on the chemical and energy and industrial side. Just want to and just clarify, I mean it certainly seems like the industrial sentiment feels like it might have bottomed. It seems like your tone is little bit better from three months ago. Even though, again, chemical and energy is probably going to be down similar this quarter and again next quarter. But, I guess what you're hearing from customers there on spend plans? Again, it sounds like you're a little more optimistic and talking a little more bullishly about '21. So, I'm just wondering, I guess, as we enter into the end of this fiscal year into '21, are you seeing things improve a little bit? Obviously, you\u2019ll come up against very easy comps, but it does seem like the tone is a little more positive. So, are you hearing from customers, things that are trending a little bit better into '21?\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think that's a fair assessment of what I was trying to communicate today. First of all, the fact that we do think it's bottomed. And that was our thesis when things started going directly down and the pandemic hit. So, we do see that. Again, I don't want to get too far out and describe some big dramatic increase in growth in this space. But, customers are working on the plans. Chevron actually is making some big investments in Iraq. So capital -- these are ongoing concerns, and they can hold back their capital for a while, but they're going to want to maintain their operations at the highest capabilities. So, we're hopeful that the budget environment will be a little bit different in '21. I think once we get a little bit more clarity, once our customers feeling more clarity in their view where the economy's gone, then they can make their decisions with a lot more confidence. So, the PMIs are good view of how some of them may be changing. So, again, don't over interpret this for fourth quarter, but it does point to '21 being perhaps a better environment.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: So, I wanted to go back to the NASD business and just get a little bit more color. Are you working on any of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine? I guess, curious because the trials are going so quickly. I was curious to get your take if one [indiscernible] and into commercial within the next six months, how would you manage the business to deliver on the capacity that customer might need for that?\nMike McMullen: Hey, Sam, I\u2019m going to pass that to you.\nSam Raha: Yes. no problem, Mike. So, I can't comment specifically on the molecule or the molecule of the projects that we're doing related to COVID-19. But, two things I will point out. As Bob indicated earlier, this is business separate for or different than the business we're already doing or it's not taking the place of business, if you will. And we believe, we have the capacity and that's -- if the demand is there related to certain things playing out related to COVID-19 and the molecule that we happen to be working on, we believe we will be in a position to be able to supply that material as the volume required.\nJack Meehan: And then, one more follow-up on LSAG. I'm just curious, as you're looking at the research labs around the globe, kind of in this conversation around deferral versus cancellation, what are customers telling you? Is it still mostly deferrals versus cancellations? And on the deferral side, when do you expect these, how far out is it getting pushed something that you think it hits before the end of the year or probably more likely in calendar '21?\nMike McMullen: Hey Jack. Happy to answer this question. This is something we've been monitoring pretty closely, deferrals versus cancellations. And we've really been pleased, our cancellations are actually lower than last year. And our thesis is they\u2019re being pushed and actually funds will be deployed this calendar year.\nBob McMahon: Yes. That's what we actually -- we saw that -- Jack, some of that actually happened in Q3. And as people are going back into the labs physically there, then they can install the instrumentation. But to Mike's point, we've seen no cancellation or lower cancellations than what we would have last year. There's always some level of it. I would say that we've been extraordinarily pleased. And I would expect it to happen this calendar year.\nOperator: This concludes the allotted time for our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ankur for any closing remarks.\nAnkur Dhingra: Yes. So, that concludes the call for today. Thanks, everyone for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sam Raha",
            "content": "Yes. Sure, Mike. Hi, Tycho. As you -- I think you\u2019d have seen a good pickup in terms of our qPCR instruments, which are our Aria systems, as well as our bioreagents related to qPCR both reverse transcriptase master mixes. On the antibody side, we\u2019ve definitely also seen an increase in IgA, IgG and those antibodies. In terms of our own tests, we are very actively exploring the possibilities of developing those. So, more to share in due course. Yes, sure. No problem. Tycho, I'd start by reiterating a little bit of what Mike and Bob were talking about. It's interesting that it was just last June that we did a ribbon cutting and starting of the new Frederick, Colorado facility. And quite frankly, we've seen demand that exceeded our expectations, just 12 months ago. So, building really -- sorry, the new manufacturing line that we're building, you can consider it, as we call it, training on steroids as our general. But, it is very-differentiated, both in throughput and the molecules it can do, which is a segue to your -- a little bit of your question that we're able to do multiple iterations or types of siRNA or RNA. We're also actively looking at other different versions of molecules that are oligo based. Though I can't reveal the details, we have had a lot of interest related to COVID-19, all of those used for either COVID-19-related therapeutics or even for vaccines. So, I can say that we have started to work on some of those programs now. It does. Yes. no problem, Mike. So, I can't comment specifically on the molecule or the molecule of the projects that we're doing related to COVID-19. But, two things I will point out. As Bob indicated earlier, this is business separate for or different than the business we're already doing or it's not taking the place of business, if you will.

We are playing a game where we are leveraging our whole portfolio, not going after one product line versus each other and the customer really likes that we\u2019re outcome based. So that's what is happening right now. And we see here in the crisis that not only are they excited about the investments we have done over the past year, but also, as Mike talked about, in the digital world, into the work world, we have been very optimistic and super responsive they have taken off the digital, we take challenge variable very, very good and the customers responded very, very positive to it.

The Agilent team delivered excellent results in the third quarter in the midst of a historic global pandemic. Against this backdrop, Agilent's performance once again highlights the strength and resiliency of our team and our business. Agilent's Q3 revenues are $1.26 billion. Our revenues are down just 1% on a reported basis, despite COVID-19 headwinds in what we expect to be the year's most challenging quarter. On a core basis, revenues are down 3%. These results demonstrate the strong resilience we have built into our business over the past several years. EPS is $0.78 per share. This is a 3% year-over-year increase. Operating margin grew 90 basis points over last year to 23.7%. Our Q3 results are further evidence of the success of our profitable build-and-by growth strategy. We continue to build a more resilient growth oriented business. Last quarter, I talked to you about the four key priorities we're focused on during the COVID-19 pandemic: Protecting our people; being open for business for our customers; taking decisive action to deliver our P&L and balance sheet; and unwavering commitment to growth. Staying focused on these priorities has helped us navigate through the COVID-19 effects on our team, customers and business. Our customers continue to respond very favorably to our team's engagement and enhanced digital capabilities. In fact, Q3 customer satisfaction rankings are at all-time highs. In all regions, we're seeing improvement in lab access for our customers and increase non-COVID-19 testing volumes. There are, however, regional and end-market differences in the pacing of improvement. Labs access improved through the quarter, although still not at pre-COVID-19 levels. Globally, lab access remains limited in academia, non-COVID-19 research and testing labs. We're also seeing continued limited access at some private sector research labs in Europe and United States. Similarly, non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing volumes improved throughout the quarter, but remained down from prior levels. Hospital access in Europe and the U.S. is improving, although disrupted at times by virus flare up. While there are indications of improvement in economic growth at varying degrees across the globe, caution remains at customer capital expenditure decisions. Consistent with our thinking coming into the quarter, the pace of recovery varied by region. As expected, China led the way for us and exceeded our expectations with revenues up 11%. China's growth in the quarter is broad-based across all end market and for all business groups. While improving the rate of recovery in Europe, and the Americas lags China, given the timing when these reasons first felt the brunt of the pandemic, European revenues are down 5%. Americas market conditions trailed both China and Europe with revenues declining 10%. However, as we exited the quarter, we are seeing signs of improvement in service activity, consumables and diagnostic testing volumes. On a total Company basis, we exited July with modest growth across all major markets. Now, let's talk about our performance by business groups. Our Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group grew 2% on a reported basis and declined 4%. Our team is focused and determined to gain market share despite a constrained capital environment. The strength of our portfolio coupled with an energized and stable sales team is paying dividends. I'm also very proud of contributions are selling our cell analysis technologies are making in COVID-19 virus research. Our M&A strategy is working and making a difference in the pandemic fight. Our CrossLab Group revenues grew 1%. Increase in customer activity led to increased sales of consumables and an uptake of on-demand services. The CrossLab team continues to win large, multiyear contracts for enterprise laboratory management that will benefit us moving forward. We will continue to increase our competitiveness in this space. Our Diagnostics and Genomics Group revenues declined 8%. While our overall pathology and genomics businesses are down for the quarter, we did see gradual improvement in diagnostic testing volumes and non-COVID-19 lab openings. Partially offsetting this, our nucleic acid solution business delivered another strong quarter, growing almost 25%. We are very excited about the future of our NASD business. As we announced earlier today, we plan to more than double oligo manufacturing capacity and our new Frederick, Colorado site. This expansion helps us meet significantly increasing customer demand. We are growing double-digit and expect to continue this rate of growth in the coming years. We continue to advance in our portfolio across all our businesses. Highlights during the quarter included LSAG launching two new LC/MS products in Agilent 6470B Triple Quad and the Agilent RapidFire 400 systems. Both products are in high throughput labs, driving productivity and superior resolution. We launched our CrossLab Asset Monitoring service, which is a new subscription service using instrument sensor technologies to provide data driven usage insights. This helps drive improved customer economics and lab productivity. While early, we are seeing strong interest from customers in this service. During the quarter, our PD-L1 assay was approved by the FDA for expanded use of non-small cell lung cancer, helping guide physicians in selecting treatments using specific immunotherapies. Our team is very proud of the role their company is playing in the global COVID-19 play. We are supporting COVID-19 research, testing and therapeutic of vaccine development. Our efforts in the global fight against the virus delivered 2 percentage points of reported growth. We are accelerating efforts to make a difference in the battle against COVID-19 and have mobilized across Agilent team to maximize customer support. Let me close with few comments on our outlook in the coming quarter. While there's still significant uncertainty regarding the continued pace of recovery, we expect the July trend of gradual improvement in our business to continue into Q4. By region, China will continue to be a positive story for us and lead return to growth. Europe is starting to trend upward. The Americas are also expected to improve but at lower rate than China and Europe. Globally, improved lab access, increasing non-COVID-19 testing and a slowly recovering global economy are all positive signs. I remain absolutely convinced Agilent will emerge from this pandemic with a stronger position in the marketplace. Our continued focus action on four priorities, protect the team; support our customers; preserve our P&L and balance sheet; and our unwavering investment in growth are delivering. Entering Q4, we are operating from a position of strength and with momentum. Yes, this pandemic remains unpredictable. However, I am cautiously optimistic about our continued gradual recovery and return to growth. Before I hand the call over to Bob, I'd like to pause and share my hope that you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy. Thanks for being on the call. I look forward to taking your question after Bob's remarks. And now, Bob, over to you. Hey, Doug. How are you doing? Yes. Sure, Doug. I touched on it briefly in my comments. So, there's two points of reported growth in Q3. Hey Doug. Thanks for those questions. So, just to make sure it came through the audience. The question was about our view on the growth rate of China for the rest of the year as well as can that high-single-digit growth rate in food be sustained. We think the answer is yes on both. We're really pleased with our performance in China. It was broad based. I tried to really accentuate that in my comments. We saw basically double-digit growth across all end markets in China. And we think that a double-digit growth rate is within the realm of possibility for Q4 in China. And I have to say, Doug, it's wonderful we talking about China food from a different vector. We've been talking about it probably last 18, 24 months of one that will return to growth. We saw some early indications in Q2, we saw strong Q3, and we think that are all numbers probably sustainable for the rest of this year. Want to say something, Bob? And Bob, I think it\u2019s probably fair to say, the wildcard is United States, right? And we were encouraged by the movement in PMIs. You probably noticed that. But, let's see how that translates into business in the coming quarter. And again, we have to keep in mind ourselves, as pleased as we are with the result we just delivered, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there because the virus is unpredictable at times. Yes. And Vijay, let me kind of frame into kind of the numbers. What we were talking about is the Frederick site has the potential of roughly $100 million worth of revenue. And we added capacity that more than doubles that $100 million to give you a frame of the numbers. So, it's not 100, 200, 400, it's 100, 200 and more than 300 to kind of give you a sense. And in terms of July, we actually came in with growth across all three groups in exiting in July. Yes. Tycho, I'll make some initial comments and then the group presidents are kind of quiet today. So, I\u2019ll pull Sam in here as well, to provide his perspective. But, we think that there's still tailwinds in front of us and now two points of growth, and we think we can sustain that at a minimum. That's why I tried to put fairly bullish comments about our stepped up efforts across the Company. Some of these things are going to take a little bit longer. We think there's still room for our own test of quality tests with some different features. But, I think maybe a few comments there, Sam, from your perspective? And Tycho, I guess, what I\u2019d just close off here is a broad-based nature of our portfolio is allowing us to play in multiple aspects of this COVID-19. Some of these things may take a little bit longer to actually turn into revenue, right? So, if you're working with, say, a pharma partner or something in the therapeutic area, it may take a while for that to come to market. So, we think these tailwinds are here to stay for some time. And we're stepping up our efforts here because it plays right into the broad nature of our portfolio. Do you want to take that one, Sam? And Tycho, the supply chain consideration and discussions still happen and it gets added a level of stability, albeit down to this -- into the space. And, again, as you look ahead for the future, this is an area where eventually it'll come back, and again, too early to call. But, I'd say we're pretty confident about the improvement rate in pharma. Yes. Happy to do so. So, it's all market, it\u2019s all access to labs and patients going for the diagnostic test. So, it's real all market. I think, we're seeing different pace of pacing throughout the quarter. All of our geographies in the diagnostic testing front ended up with positive growth in July, but it was down sharply in May and June, particularly in the U.S. And keep in mind also, we -- part of our business in our genomics front is so select into NGS-based diagnostic labs and for genetic disorders, for example, those tests aren't getting done either. So, it's really all market. That's good point, Bob. Thanks. Yes. That's part of the story for our COVID-19 tailwinds. And I think probably the biggest contribution this quarter actually came from BioTek, Bob, if I remember correctly? Bravo. So, it's kind of like, now we like a one-two punch kind of going there on the core instrumentation. I\u2019d also remind you, with the Bravo platform comes an ongoing revenue stream associated with the tips that go with those liquid handlers. Yes. Puneet, happy to have Padraig jumping on here and provide his perspective on that. So, Padraig, in the call script I talk a bit about the large enterprise deals you guys won. So, why don\u2019t you talk about that a little more detail? Yes. And I was going to say that I think the geography Puneet is largely in the U.S., but there are some global opportunities as well. It\u2019s really non-COVID-19 related. I mean, this is part of the core growth strategy for Padraig\u2019s business to continue to expand our market share on the Enterprise Services front. And we're really delighted that we made some big pharma deals. Hey Bob, if I could maybe add a comment on your -- on the first remark. So, this is really, Derik, all about a new way of working in Agilent. So, I'm preparing for a manager's call later this week. And what we're talking to our team about is more digital, less travel. And we're really going to make sure that when we get on the other side of COVID-19 pandemic that we don't revert to our old ways of traveling. And we know from our customer satisfaction scores, they love the responses we have now with our digital platforms. I'm going to have Jacob handle the first question. And Jacob, you can pass it back to Bob and I for the second question. And I know Jacob would be just delighted to talk about the share dynamics in China, which we think are very positive for Agilent? And then, on the other question, Derek, what we're hearing from our customers, particularly in the public sector and we\u2019re seeing it in our order book, and while I'll offer my perspective here, and feel free to build on my comments here. But, there's a real sense of making sure they commit to the budgets. So, we're seeing it both in our order book as well as order activity, where there is a lot of uncertainty what's going to happen post elections as we go into 2021. So, they want to commit those funds. And it's actually quite amazing the amount of deal activity that's going to occur without visiting a customer face to face. So Bob, I don\u2019t know what you're hearing from field\u2026 Yes. Sure, Brandon. And I'll start off here, and Bob, feel free to jump in. But, we felt quite comfortable resuming our share repurchase program on the non-dilutive perspective, and we'll be looking at opportunistic as well. And cash flow remains strong. We felt for some time that the third quarter of this year would be the toughest quarter for us for the year. We\u2019re through that now. And the third quarter actually was significantly better than we had thought. And we saw positive growth across all the businesses in July. So, we think, okay, barring some kind of major flare-up, we should be able to continue to see this gradual improvement of growth in the fourth quarter, sort of our message. So, we have the comp. We also narrowed the framework that we provided, it\u2019s more narrower than it was in Q3. But again, I think we need to keep in mind ourselves that we still -- there's still a lot of uncertainty associated with the pandemic. I think, our capital deployment approach remains unchanged, which is, we certainly wanted a balanced approach to capital deployment across dividends, cash, share repos and with the prioritization of investment in business, we just made a significant commitment in capital with our new NASD expansion. And we're still on the hunt for deals that make sense for Agilent. So, our approach to capital deployment really fundamentally remains unchanged. We paused a bit in the second quarter just because -- on the share repo because of the -- in the early part of the third quarter, given what was going on in the environment outside of Agilent. So, we feel pretty good about where we are right now and have a reasonable level of confidence, and there is decent level of stability about the business. Hey Dan. Yes. I think, it\u2019s perhaps end of '22. And don\u2019t specifically talk about specific targets or areas of focus, certainly, but it's not out of the realm of reason that I would say, why wouldn\u2019t we want to further expand this business inorganically as well? So, that's not out of the realm. I'm not singling anything near-term happening. But we think we're operating from a position of strength here in this business. We had a first -- get our new factory up and running and build for that. So, we now think we have a, if you will, a beachhead to build from both, organically and inorganically. Yes. I tried to hit that in my remarks, which as I really say, hey listen, we know we're picking up share in a tight market. And I think you saw that on C&E, right, which is if a C&E capital purchase is going down, it's coming Agilent\u2019s way. And that's why -- and the market is still cautious, but you see PMI starting to creep up a bit, so. Sure. So, I think, I\u2019d say China is in lead position in terms of if you -- almost full recovery. Europe is second and the U.S. is trailing. So for the first -- throughout the quarter, if I look at Sam's business in the U.S., for example, the first two months were negative of diagnostic testing values in pathology. But we saw actually improvement to growth in July. So, I think that's sort of the pattern of how the pandemic has flowed around the world. China is back. Europe's on its way. And I'd say, U.S. is still in the early stages of recovery. Thanks, Steve. Happy to comment on that. I think, that's still going to happen. And these things take time. But, there's active discussion. And, by the way, I wouldn't say it's just confined I the United States. I mean, many geographies are now looking at the security of their supply chain, both in the pharma side as well as in the chemical marketplace where they're providing precursors into the APIs for the pharma chains. So, there's nothing significant to announce relative to the impact on business, but there does seem to be an overall trend in this regard. And I can say also from an Agilent perspective, we're working hard to make sure that our supply chain is secure as well. So, I think that the COVID-19 pandemic is a real wake up call to really some vulnerabilities in some aspects of supply chain. So, we're kind of working both sides of it, which are to ensure our own ability to deliver product under multiple scenarios, as well as we do see some market trends underway. Bob, I know you take a look at this pretty\u2026 Hey, Bob, why don't I make some initial comments, and then we can check our notes to see if I missed anything. But, I think unlike the last quarter, the mix here -- and I think both the chemical and the energy later side had about the same dynamics where both were down about the same, primarily on the instrument side. And on one hand, the chemical side of the business was really benefiting -- continues benefit from the low oil prices. But, some of their end markets are weak, whether be automotive or some of the other markets that they service are weak. Some of them are getting a little bit of help on COVID-19 related products. But overall, I'd say both, the chemical side, as well as the energy side of that are down about the same, but stable. And I have to say that Bob and I had talked to at some length about this in our last call. And our prediction at the time was we thought we were going to be in a stable situation relative to this. That wasn\u2019t going to get any worse. That was sort of the question we were getting last call. So, I think we're really pleased to see that that came through this quarter. And we expect that eventually this thing will start to move back to grow. I think it's probably a 70-30 mix, where most of it\u2019s in QA/QC. And that's why these facilities are running, albeit maybe not at full volume. So, QA/QC equipment will be needed as well as consumer services that go with it. So, they can only hold off the depots on that side for so long. There is an element of research. But I think in the chemical and energy space, the biggest driver for that is the QA/QC side of the business. No, I'll jump in on this. But from our perspective, I don't know real surprises. Maybe we're -- like all of us are watching what was happening with the pandemic as it worked its way across throughout the U.S. and we saw the case numbers go up and lab access was down really sharply April, May, June and we started seeing some recovery. So, I think no real surprises versus what we thought. Yes. I think that's a fair assessment of what I was trying to communicate today. First of all, the fact that we do think it's bottomed. And that was our thesis when things started going directly down and the pandemic hit. So, we do see that. Again, I don't want to get too far out and describe some big dramatic increase in growth in this space. But, customers are working on the plans. Chevron actually is making some big investments in Iraq. So capital -- these are ongoing concerns, and they can hold back their capital for a while, but they're going to want to maintain their operations at the highest capabilities. So, we're hopeful that the budget environment will be a little bit different in '21. I think once we get a little bit more clarity, once our customers feeling more clarity in their view where the economy's gone, then they can make their decisions with a lot more confidence. So, the PMIs are good view of how some of them may be changing. So, again, don't over interpret this for fourth quarter, but it does point to '21 being perhaps a better environment. Hey, Sam, I\u2019m going to pass that to you. Hey Jack. Happy to answer this question. This is something we've been monitoring pretty closely, deferrals versus cancellations. And we've really been pleased, our cancellations are actually lower than last year. And our thesis is they\u2019re being pushed and actually funds will be deployed this calendar year."

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the third quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. And then, I'll finish up with a framework for thinking about Q4. As with last quarter, there are still too many unknowns. So, we're not going to provide formal forward-looking guidance today. However, we will provide a framework for how we see things potentially playing out in Q4. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike mentioned, our revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, down 1% on a reported basis. On a core basis, revenue declined 3.1% in the quarter, currency negatively affected revenue by 1.3 percentage points, while acquisitions added 3.4 percentage points to growth. As Mike talked about the regional performance, I'll speak to the end-market performance. In terms of our end markets, pharma grew 2% in Q3 against a very strong comparison of 13% from last year. Both, small and large molecule applications grew and biopharma improved throughout the quarter as drug development labs increased production and access. We experienced softness in diagnostics and clinical, as anticipated. Revenues declined 10%, primarily due to conditions in the U.S., driven by COVID-19-related disruptions to patient visits and diagnostic lab opportunities. Encouragingly, we did see an improvement in routine testing throughout the quarter, especially in China and Europe, while the U.S. lagged. Chemical and energy was down 10%, consistent with our thinking. Revenues were generally flat sequentially with conditions largely similar to what we saw in Q2. As we've talked about previously, we expect this segment to ramp more slowly than others. The food segment was a bright spot, up 8%. We're seeing ongoing signals that the market in China has stabilized with the transition of more testing by commercial labs. The food market was just one of several bright spots that contributed to double-digit growth in China, including growth in the low-teens for our pharma business. Our environmental and forensics business declined mid-single-digits against the double-digit compare and the academic and government segments declined mid-single-digits, while improving on a sequential basis in Q3. Strength in cell analysis and liquid handling for viral research partially offset the widespread impact of the ongoing academic lab closes. Now, let's turn to the rest of the P&L. I'm extremely proud of how the Agilent team has responded to the challenging environment. During the quarter, we continued our focus on managing expenses, while ensuring we continue to invest in our key growth opportunities. These expense management actions we initiated last quarter were on full display in Q3. In addition, our customer engagement model using digital tools continued to gain traction, while also delivering savings in SG&A. As a result, operating margins of 23.7% improved 90 basis points over last year on declining revenues. Gross margin at 55.1% was down 130 basis points versus the prior year, largely due to mix, and higher logistics costs. However, strong cost management and operating expenses more than offset the decline in gross margin. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.78 per share, up nearly 3% from the number we posted a year ago. From a balance sheet perspective, we generated $290 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is $48 million improvement over last year. In terms of capital spending, we spent $25 million, lower than last year and in line with our revised look in Q2. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.3 billion in available liquidity, including $1.36 billion in cash. Also during the quarter, we took advantage of low interest rates and refinanced $0.5 billion in short-term debt with a 10-year bond and a 2.1% coupon, the lowest coupon in our portfolio. As you know, we paused share buybacks in Q2, pending improvement in business conditions. In Q3, our visibility into business trends and cash flow improved, and we resumed anti-dilutive share repurchases late in the quarter. In the quarter, in total, we repurchase 360,000 shares for $33 million. Going forward, we intend to resume our normal pattern of regular anti-dilutive repurchases, along with additional opportunistic buying. Our overall capital deployment approach remains balanced with the primary focus on growth M&A opportunities, while also returning the cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. As we look to Q4, business and trends have gradually improved, but significant uncertainty remains around the evolution of this pandemic. However, let me provide a framework for how we see a range of possible revenue growth scenarios in the coming quarter. We generally expected trajectory of gradual improvement in business results to continue across all regions. Areas where we see a broader range of scenarios include research spending, both in academia and other markets, non-COVID diagnostic testing, especially in the U.S., and the general CapEx environment. The combination of these factors could result in scenarios where our revenue performance could range from a 4% decline to 1% core growth. Also, as a reminder, the BioTek acquisition closed midway through Q4 of last year. So, the M&A impact in Q4 will be smaller than in previous quarters, roughly 1 point growth and currency is forecasted to be positive in the quarter. The low end of this range envisions COVID-19 flare-ups occurring in the fall in various geographies, limiting and in some cases, reversing the recovery gains we've seen in a period of time. In this scenario, one might expect to see slower or stalled improvements in research, academia and other markets as continued tight cash management leading to lower CapEx spending in the U.S. and Europe. We hope this bottom end of the range is overly conservative, but we wanted to let you know, we have plans in place in case this happens. The higher end of the range assumes continued recovery by region, building on what we have seen in July, with the biggest impact coming from the U.S. This would include a continual increase in elective medical procedures such as cancer screenings, as well as continued lab openings. This view would also include continued China momentum, along with the continued improvement in Europe and other areas in the Americas. Again, this is not guidance, but should provide a sense for some of the variables we see for Q4. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy continues its path to recovery. With that, I'll turn over things to Ankur to direct the Q&A. Ankur? Yes. I would just say, Doug, to add, I mean, one of the things that was very positive about China was it was pretty consistent across the quarter, and in fact exited slightly higher than that overall 11%, but we saw solid growth all three months. Yes. Vijay, this is Bob. I'll take that. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we hope that that is overly conservative. What that would imply is actually a retrenchment -- and in COVID-19 flare-ups here in the U.S. as we go back -- as we move into the fall, and you start seeing some elements of shutdown. So, we certainly would hope that we would do better than that. But, we wanted to provide, hey, that's within the realm of kind of how we're thinking about our spending and so forth. Our July results -- or our exit rate of the quarter was much higher than that. And so, we're aiming to do better. But there's still uncertainty in the world with the pandemic, people going back to school and so forth, so. Yes, absolutely. Yes. That's right, Mike. I mean, if you looked at each one of the major markets, each one of the major markets got better in Q3 versus Q2 with the exception of the U.S., which we expected given kind of the state of affairs with the pandemic. No, it's slightly different math. I think, we've been consistent with our view of needing to double our capacity. What we ended up doing is actually triggering the decision to initiate expansion earlier than we thought, just given the robust nature of the end market. And as well as we have worked our way to be able to -- in the same space, we challenged ourselves to find ways to drive as much revenue in the same physical space. So, we are investing a little bit more capital than we initially thought. But, we're also building something slightly different than our first train, which is going to give us actually more volume than our current train A. So, it's a really -- we thought it was really positive signal. And that\u2019s why sent out the press release this morning, because we're super excited about our prospects here. Yes. And maybe Sam to add. That being said, the capacity expansion isn't tied to COVID-19. We have plenty of demand outside of COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines. And so, this is a broad-based capacity expansion. Yes. Probably -- C&E is probably the one that's -- I would expect it to be pretty stable and that down 10ish percent -- 8% to 10% in that range. We do expect pharma to continue to improve. So that 2% certainly even in the low scenario would stay there and then on the high scenario would accelerate, which is consistent with the trends we've seen throughout the quarter of Q3. Yes. The way to think about those reshoring is those are opportunities and discussions that could happen through the order book, and then will happen actually in '21 and beyond in terms of investments are being made. So, that's more future looking. Yes. I was going to say, Puneet, actually if you bifurcate those two and look at our performance, actually, pathology performed better than NGS testing volumes, given what Mike was just talking about, as well as some of the academic institutions. Yes. Between BioTek and Bravo. Let me take that, Derik. It's great question and we certainly are very pleased with how the team has responded, as I mentioned before. As we talked about, a large amount of the cost, we have not done things like furloughs. We stabilized the team. We have not reduced base pay and things like that. So, these are discretionary expenses that a lot of them we think had the opportunity to stay away, be travel and things like that, which our digital tools have enabled us to really continue to support our customers. And so, there aren't any kind of one time things that happened in the quarter.  In terms of going forward to Q4, we are looking at probably less of a margin -- incremental margin improvement because we are looking for ways to continue to invest to drive growth as the economy recovers. We also have some startup costs in the NASD new facility as well. So, it's probably less than what we've had historically had, which is call it 30% to 40% incremental. But it's really to drive growth. The only thing I would add is just reiterate what Jacob was saying, because it's not just China. I think, when you look at our LSAG portfolio, I think what people don't fully appreciate is, is how we've actually changed the portfolio to technology platforms, they're probably the best -- in the best shape they have been in probably five years in terms of new products and so forth. And I think you're seeing that across the globe. And when we think about where we ended up in Q3, LSAG was certainly the standout relative to where we thought they were going to be. In a capital constrained environment only down 4% on a core basically speaks to our responsiveness to customers. Yes. Sure. We\u2019re hoping that's not a trend that's going to be around for a while, but it certainly was exacerbated in the Q3. That being said, I would say three quarters of that was probably mix, when you look at the various businesses across each one of the groups. But, where we saw logistics, challenges are, it's lower capacity and freight and air capacity. But we would expect that -- and we actually saw that through the quarter to kind of relax. And I think as you\u2019re starting to see more intercontinental travel, both from a passenger standpoint as well as freight standpoint we would expect that to kind of relax over time. It could be. I'll just leave it at that. There's still a lot of uncertainty and so forth. But certainly, we wouldn't complain if it was better than that. I'll take the first one just real quick. And then, Mike, if you want to add something on the second one. We announced that we would make that $150 million investment and we would expect it to go live towards the end of 2022. So, it's taking a little longer than just a regular train. Sam mentioned train A on steroids. So, it's bigger, and probably take a little more capital. And obviously with COVID-19 there's some activity there in terms of little long lead time. But, we feel like we have the capacity to be able to manage us through that time, and then that will come online at the end of 2020. Yes. I think -- Catherine, this is Bob, all three of our businesses actually performed better in July than they did in May and June, which was very positive. The ACG business actually led the charge in terms of that, as you would expect, given the resumption of activities. There's some catch up there, in terms of -- we saw that kind of phenomenon actually in China, in April. But ultimately ACG was there. I think, LSAG capital is going to continue to be constrained. But I think what we've seen in our business is we've talked about this in the past kind of this flight to quality. And with our instrumentation and the reputation that we have, I think in a capital constrained environment, those dollars are precious. And we think our positioning is very good vis-\u00e0-vis the market. Yes, Catherine, just one last thing, to give you maybe a little more color. If we look across the groups, we would expect LSAG to still be negative in Q4. I mean, it's probably going to lag, given the [Multiple Speakers] big fourth quarter last year as well. Yes. And I would say, in the U.S. it\u2019s probably -- and keep me honest, Sam it\u2019s -- we're probably still at about 80% pre-COVID levels from a diagnostics perspective, but improving where it was. It was below that at the beginning of the quarter, so. Does that sound, Sam? Yes. Just to build on that, we talked a little bit about earlier in the call. We would expect that to see some of that opportunity show in our order book. And that's probably more a \u201821 timeframe for revenue. I wouldn't expect any of that to happen in Q4, just given the kind of timing. But you're seeing it in multiple end markets in multiple regions. We think this is a trend that will continue. Yes. And the only thing I\u2019d add, Dan is we would expect this, as you said, kind of steady slow progress going forward. Yes. I was going to say, Dan, one of the things we were incredibly proud of in China was all three of the business groups grew and all of our end markets grew, really led by food, which was up over 20%. It's been a while since we've been able to say that. And so, we think that -- we talked about kind of the moves away from the government labs or the central labs into the commercial labs, and we think that that's stabilized, and team has really been able to garner share, or our view of capacity in that space. And then, in pharma, it continues to perform very well. Actually, pharma was up roughly 10% in China, and that's a combination of both, large and small molecule. And I think that our thesis around that continues to play out, which is that the winners of the 4 plus 7 or the tendering process are -- customers that where we are over indexed, and we continue to see that positive momentum, we actually saw acceleration from Q2 to Q3 in both, food and pharma, and the rest of the businesses were positive as well. So, I think, it\u2019s broad-based. Yes. I would agree. I mean, Patrick, this is Bob. The Americas, as Mike said earlier, is in fact the biggest variable because it's further along in its recovery than both Europe and China. And I think, the thing that we're watching is those COVID flare-ups and the potential impact on elective procedures, which would impact our diagnostics business. That's probably got the biggest variability going into Q4 relative to LSAG and ACG. But, to Mike's point, we did not see any significant change with these flare-ups in August -- or excuse me in July and early August. Yes. That's what we actually -- we saw that -- Jack, some of that actually happened in Q3. And as people are going back into the labs physically there, then they can install the instrumentation. But to Mike's point, we've seen no cancellation or lower cancellations than what we would have last year. There's always some level of it. I would say that we've been extraordinarily pleased. And I would expect it to happen this calendar year."

I'm glad he could be here with us on the call.  Last quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn't changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas.  Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered the global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.  It should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities, promote technical assistance to urgently delivering Bravo liquid handler systems for their COVID-19 test or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We're doubling down on our efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.  Our third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured [indiscernible] order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn't shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses.  We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritize and sustained our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk. Bob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.  The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margin of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.  Before covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth. Our Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach to investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor and help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\u2019ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics. Let\u2019s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\u2019s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business, as COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%, however, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities. Our China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect that China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Some quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\u2019s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical. The food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one-point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized across Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth. Thank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\u2019re up.\nBob McMahon: Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said and hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3. Given the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\u2019re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process and how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Reported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varies significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures, being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March, driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduce lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carry through the month of April resulting in double digit declines for the month in those regions. On the other hand, and as we had anticipated business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China, as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline. Before getting into some additional group details, it\u2019s also important to note while we have seen some order push outs, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations in both March and April cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the Academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays and installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\u2019m pleased to say that our DDG business delivered 5% growth during Q2, and it was on track for double digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions except for the U.S. where the affects of delayed and non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%. Now let\u2019s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost trucker through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continue to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leverage digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focus most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year, mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share flat with the number we posted a year ago. Now in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all our share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we've taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year. In addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio as defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won't be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity is very similar to April and the business activity we've seen in the first few weeks of the month confirmed that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery, relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue to remain resilient. And we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery and demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1$ contribution in Q2. On the higher end of the decline, we\u2019re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S., and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S., and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward. In Q3, we expect a two-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a three-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers. Before I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\u2019s performance for the first two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\u2019d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\u2019ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future. And with that, I believe Mike would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike?\nMike McMullen: Yes, thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The Agilent team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace. And, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you.\nAnkur Dhingra: Thank you. Jody, if you can open the line for Q&A, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Thanks. I'm going to start by asking about the guide. You said China is plateauing. So what I guess sequentially is getting worse here since you captured April in the prior quarter. Why should things be deteriorating for the upcoming quarter? And then, on the COVID tailwinds did the 35% growth you called out in NASD, does that capture anything around COVID manufacturing? Or can you maybe just touch on what drove the strength there too?\nMike McMullen: Do you want to take that one?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob, I'll take the question. I'll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It's mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened. And we're very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing. On the first question that you had, again, this isn't guidance it's kind of a range of scenarios that we're planning. And we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15% would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And but if there are relapses, if China does relapse, or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So it's a wider range than we would normally have. But there's obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast.\nTycho Peterson: And on the uncertainty, chemical and energy, you mentioned customer shifting supply chains. Can you maybe just talk about how much of the sequential step down here at C&E and given the volatility in oil purchase, how much of a factor that is?\nMike McMullen: Sure. Yes, Bob, I'll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume than it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we're starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really cause many parts of world to rethink their supply chain. So we're seeing early indications of moving of on shoring ensuring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside I think. But basically, we're assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3.\nBob McMahon: Yes, Tyco, if you look \u2013 if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn't have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. So academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now albeit down.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then one clarification point\u2026\nMike McMullen: Okay. Sorry, I was going to add to that. I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it's important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing.\nTycho Peterson: And then just one clarification before I hop off on Lasergen, again, it sounds like, this is a full write down, is that correct? You're kind of abandoning your project. That seems a little bit different than what you talked about back at our conference in January. So can you clarify, what changed there?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Well, actually you reference your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own. And Bob, I'll let you comment on the financial side of that.\nBob McMahon: Yes. It is a full shut down and we will have a write-off in Q2.\nTycho Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSteve Beuchaw: Thanks for your time here. I wanted to ask, first of all, on the strategic activity in this space. One thing that we've seen across tools and devices is this upwelling of interest in capital raise in part with a view that there is an opportunity for accelerated capital deployment, given potential for opportunity here. You guys have a uniquely strong balance sheet comparatively, certainly plenty of liquidity. I wonder if you could speak to how you think about capital deployment and the intensity of capital deployment in the next year. And then I have two follow-ups. Thanks.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we'd like to deploy capital in M&A, that makes sense for the company. And we've talked about our criteria around end markets that we know, where companies that we've acquired and have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. But we have noticed as some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I'd also tell you the valuations haven't moved much. So this is not a buyer's market and you can buy things on the cheap, so you really have to be think through what you're looking at and does it make sense for the company? Anything else you'd add to that, Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or\u2026\nSteve Beuchaw: Yes. Sorry. I thought Bob might chime in there. But I have two follow-ups. One is, I wonder if you could speak to activity on a month-to-month basis and the extent to which you think there might've been any sort of April snapback. You commented on it specifically in China, but any snapback activity in other parts of the world and the extent to which people might be trying to ramp quickly and how that might reflect, not just in China, but on \u2013 growth as a trend line prospectively for non-China regions. And then one just quick one, I am curious how you guys are thinking about planning for growth in CrossLab given that CrossLab historically been a very strong grower and some component of the CrossLab growth story has been penetration into new categories, is that penetration story still active in the current environment. Thanks so much.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I'll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you're right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has \u2013 I wouldn't call it a snapback, but it's a recovery. And we're actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it's actually coming back faster. And then the U.S., and now we're starting to see some of the U.S., it\u2019s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that \u2013 that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I'll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\u2019s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks, Bob. And I think yes, very, very strong demand. We're seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong tracks which really help our customers be productive and help with startup services and actually achieve a critical component in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback up on in terms of a demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we've developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing, I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab about our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well. And also we really shows that the customer need for productivity in these times on beyond going forward is going to be very strong.\nBob McMahon: And Steve, let me add just one other thing. In the case, obviously ACG grew 1%, it would have been stronger \u2013 several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn't install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and it will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4.\nSteve Beuchaw: Okay. In Q2, this particular quarter was not a good indicator. Much appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks guys. Mike, maybe one for you on the C&E segment, certainly encouraging to hear there was no real deterioration in April. Can you just talk through the exposure there? Obviously, E&P pretty correlated to oil prices. Maybe on the refining side, how has that reacting to the oil decline? I know typically low oil could actually be a positive if it's over supply. It feels like at least part of what's going on now is low demand, but maybe just talk through what you're seeing there and the expectations going forward.\nMike McMullen: Yes. That\u2019s a great question. And what we also try to think through, what\u2019s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\u2019ve got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\u2019m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\u2019ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. And then maybe on the other side of COVID, obviously, academic labs closing during this understandable that they should snapback quickly. I guess, how do you feel about the C&E segment? Does it feel different where, again, labs reopening, demand comes back quickly, do you think this will linger because of the oil prices? What\u2019s your outlook, maybe again? Not asking for guidance by any means, but over the next 6 months to 12 months, does this have the potential to linger versus some of the other ones that should snapback?\nMike McMullen: In my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\u2019s really just tied to events that I\u2019m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\u2019s supply chain. And we\u2019re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\u2019t get too excited. This \u2013 I would just say, let\u2019s assume that it\u2019s going to stay subdued for a while as we\u2019re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation\u2026\nMike McMullen: Yes, yes, yes, absolutely.\nBob McMahon: And we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business.\nMike McMullen: Absolutely.\nPatrick Donnelly: That\u2019s really helpful. And then a very quick cleanup on NASD, following up Tycho\u2019s question there. Do you guys have capacity to increase the address demand from COVID? Or are you already kind of maxed out in terms of the build out and just as you build out capacity, it\u2019s kind of addressing?\nMike McMullen: We are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\u2019t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\u2019t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks a lot, Mike.\nMike McMullen: You are quite welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMike McMullen: Hey, Derik.\nDerik de Bruin: Hello, good afternoon. Hi. Couple of questions, just a couple of cleanups. The NASD base now in 2Q, what\u2019s that \u2013 where are we in terms of revenues? That was up 35%. I\u2019m just curious on the base.\nMike McMullen: Yes. It\u2019s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the \u2013 or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\u2019s tracking well to that.\nDerik de Bruin: Great. And what are you going to do with the \u2013 are you reinvesting the Lasergen money into the business? Or is that going to drop through? Are you going to \u2013 and can you remind us on what you were spending on that I think it was around $50-ish million.\nMike McMullen: Yes. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\u2019ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\u2019ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\u2019re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results.\nBob McMahon: That\u2019s correct.\nMike McMullen: And there\u2019s some real talent in that team, and there\u2019s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\u2019re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned.\nDerik de Bruin: So you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing some of your chemical customers think about their supply chains and move around. What about the pharmaceutical customers? I mean, obviously, there\u2019s a push looking about bringing API manufacturing back, and you\u2019re a big player there. And this also sort of dovetails with another question on geopolitical tensions. And are you worried about the longer-term impacts of what\u2019s happening now between the U.S. and China in terms of your China business?\nBob McMahon: Yes. I\u2019ll \u2013 hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\u2019ll take the first one, and I\u2019ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\u2019re actually watching that very closely. It\u2019s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\u2019s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think \u2013 we\u2019re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\u2019s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen.\nMike McMullen: And without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\u2019re actively scenario planning. We \u2013 under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\u2019t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now.\nDerik de Bruin: And if I can squeeze one more in.\nMike McMullen: Sure, sure.\nDerik de Bruin: While Agilent doesn\u2019t do \u2013 you don\u2019t supply testing products for COVID-19. I mean, obviously, how are you thinking about testing and deploying testing for your employees? And I\u2019m sort of curious about, are your customers demanding that you get tested or people come in? Because there\u2019s some very large numbers being thrown around in terms of the size of the testing market. And so I\u2019m just curious in terms of what you\u2019re thinking.\nMike McMullen: Yes, a couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\u2019t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\u2019ve got a good feel for the demand that we\u2019re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\u2019re not requiring employees to be tested for \u2013 return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\u2019re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\u2019re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\u2019s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\u2019re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now. Relative \u2013 it\u2019s funny. We keep asking that question of our \u2013 particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\u2019re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\u2019re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\u2019ve not yet seen that.\nDerik de Bruin: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. So hate to overanalyze one month, but I want to circle back to the month of April. So 6.5% down is not so bad for all of the news we\u2019ve seen. Can you \u2013 you mentioned strength in China. Can you quantify China? I mean I was doing some back of the envelope, but it looks like it might have been greater than 20% growth in April in China. Is that in the right ballpark?\nBob McMahon: Yes. You\u2019re in the ballpark.\nMike McMullen: You\u2019re pretty at good math, Dan.\nDan Leonard: Okay. And then maybe separately follow-up. Mike, it does seem like you don\u2019t trust the trend in China. And how much of that is just uncertainty around the virus trajectory versus the maybe geopolitical or any other things?\nMike McMullen: Dan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\u2019t come through that way in my remarks. So actually\u2026\nDan Leonard: Okay. There\u2019s the plateau earlier. I wasn\u2019t sure.\nMike McMullen: No, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\u2019s wrong, we \u2013 this is what the implications would be. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is \u2013 you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\u2019s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2.\nDan Leonard: Great. Thank you for that clarification.\nMike McMullen: Absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, good afternoon, guys.\nMike McMullen: Hey, Doug. How are you doing?\nDoug Schenkel: I\u2019m doing well, thank you. So maybe a quick follow-up to Dan\u2019s question, cutting it in a different way. Bob, you said May is going to be similar to April, but you acknowledged, again, in answering the last question that China continues to get better. Logically, I think that means something or somewhere still must be getting worse coming out of April into May. Maybe I\u2019m just being a bit too forensic with how you position this. But I\u2019m just wondering, are there areas where you saw and continue to see continued deterioration as we sit here in mid to late May?\nBob McMahon: Yes, we haven\u2019t seen any continue \u2013 again, these are one point out of the month, right, but \u2013 or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\u2019re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace.\nMike McMullen: And I think Bob, it\u2019s \u2013 maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\u2019t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes.\nDoug Schenkel: That\u2019s great. Helpful color. Regarding ACG trends, specifically on the consumable side, what did you see in April and then what was that trend into May. Consumable use picking up would be a really great sign that more people are getting into labs, and as you noted, a good leading indicator for future demands. So I\u2019m just wondering, recognizing it\u2019s an unusual time, if you\u2019d be willing to go to that level just because it\u2019s important for you in the group. And if so, if you\u2019d say anything about specific end markets and geographies?\nBob McMahon: Yes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\u2019ll just leave it at that.\nDoug Schenkel: And it\u2019s tied directly to the opening a facility.\nMike McMullen: You can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\u2019s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\u2019t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\u2019ve gotten the business. We know as they\u2019ve been opening up in Europe, we\u2019re getting the business. And then when they\u2019ve slowly been opened up in the U.S. but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\u2019t opening up right now, unless you\u2019re doing COVID-19 research.\nBob McMahon: Correct.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Super, helpful. Last one, cell analysis. Can you talk a bit more about trends in this business in the quarter? You had a good quarter. The business grew year-over-year. I think on the surface, that\u2019s a bit surprising just because of the heavy mix of heavy, the exposure to academic research. How are you able to pull that off?\nMike McMullen: Yes, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\u2019d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\u2019s going on there.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, absolutely. Thank you very much. And it is actually a good story. I mean, as you say, Doug, it is a tale of two cities that clearly academia and government has been challenged during this period of time. While our exposure in biopharma has really picked up here. And furthermore, we have also seen quite some interest for the BioTek ELISA and [indiscernible] in for the theology testing. So with that, that\u2019s actually quite good demand. We also see a flow, will have a tremendous growth. We see a lot of the flow instruments being used in the research sector right now to better understand the cytokine that is happening in \u2013 relates to the COVID-19. So overall, both the biopharma space is seeing strong demand. We\u2019ve seen demand into the diagnostic testing on the COVID-19. And then obviously, academia and government overall is challenging, but we do see pocket of interest still there. So overall, great performance.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Jacob.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay, great. Thanks, again.\nMike McMullen: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, thanks. Hi, Mike. First one on NASD.\nMike McMullen: Hi, Puneet. How are you doing.\nPuneet Souda: Great, great. Thanks, Mike. So the first one on NASD. Great to see the growth there, but just wondering, was there any element of stocking from the biopharma or biotech customers there just given heading into COVID?\nMike McMullen: Sam, I think the answer is no, but I\u2019m going to \u2013 you haven\u2019t had a chance to talk today. So why don\u2019t you confirm or deny this room or around.\nSam Raha: Yes, yes. Thank you. No, the answer is no, Mike. And Puneet, that business, it\u2019s a long lead business where we both contract with customers usually several months, sometimes quarters out the work because there\u2019s a lot of a proprietary work that has to be done in conjunction with them, scheduling all the pre-validation work. So no, there was no stocking work. We\u2019ve got things scheduled out for months ahead already. So, no stocking effect.\nBob McMahon: Hey, Puneet, this is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\u2019s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\u2019t seen any of that in our demand for NASD.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. That\u2019s great to hear. So Sam, if I could and Mike, you as well, if I could ask on cancer diagnostics, obviously a high growth area and expansion into liquid biopsies and other significant market opportunities there. Now with the decision on Lasergen, how are you thinking about the long-term focus for your genomics portfolio and overall market position longer term?\nMike McMullen: Yes, I\u2019ll make some initial comments, and I\u2019ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\u2019re overall very \u2013 we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based \u2013 cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\u2019s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\u2019re doing that doesn\u2019t require a \u2013 or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that.\nSam Raha: Yes, yes. Absolutely, Mike. As you said, we are \u2013 we remain the leading provider for library preparation, particularly target enrichment kits that are used as part of NGS-based cancer diagnostics. We have some of the leading workflow elements as it relates to NGS-quality control and so forth. And also our combination of our access to clinical diagnostic labs through our pathology franchise, our CDX business where we work with pharma partners to develop companion diagnostics from \u2013 we believe, together with what we have in genomics, it still gives us a unique capability set, which we are looking to deploy that capability set by bringing that together and there\u2019s partnering opportunities. So Puneet, we haven\u2019t really changed our thesis. And as Mike said earlier, we just don\u2019t believe we need to directly develop the sequencer ourselves. But our commitment to genomics, including arrays, including NGS continues, and we feel good about it.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And if I could squeeze last one then on the Bravo Liquid Handling robots that you have obviously are being used widely among the COVID testing community as well and genomics community. So trying to see if that was a meaningful number of this quarter. And is that something you expect to continue? And if you can \u2013 if there\u2019s something you can quantify for along those lines. And I wasn\u2019t sure, this is in Sam\u2019s bucket or it\u2019s actually in the LSAG bucket.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So\u2026\nMike McMullen: So that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. That\u2019s great. All right, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks guys for squeezing me in here.\nMike McMullen: Sure, Vijay. No problem.\nVijay Kumar: Mike, so I think I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. You guys say April was down 7%, because I\u2019m trying to figure it out, If May is in line with April 6.5%. So if May is, I guess, in line with April or even I guess, if the next \u2013 forward two months are in line with April. Like how do we get to minus 15%? Maybe just help us understand the range?\nBob McMahon: It wouldn\u2019t \u2013 Vijay, you wouldn\u2019t, that would be kind of the \u2013 towards the lower end, right? So what we\u2019re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\u2019t get any better in the U.S. and Europe and we didn\u2019t really have \u2013 there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\u2019re saying we don\u2019t expect that. We hope that that\u2019s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\u2019re saying, you don\u2019t get there, you get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5%.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. That\u2019s helpful, Bob. And then I guess, on that China topic, I know in the past you guys have or I guess, some of your peers have spoken about the stimulus \u2013 China stimulus. Any details around or thoughts around a potential for stimulus? And perhaps how that could benefit you guys?\nBob McMahon: Yes. We haven\u2019t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\u2019s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us.\nVijay Kumar: Perfect. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Thanks. Mike, I was hoping you could just touch on the small molecule pharma trends in the quarter and around capital equipments. Any disruption in places like India or other geographies?\nMike McMullen: No, significant disruption, but it\u2019s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\u2019s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side.\nBob McMahon: Yes. We \u2013 our business in India is fairly small today.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. Then just one follow-up for you, Bob, just around the P&L. Can you sort of speak to the cost structure breakdown through fixed and variable? And maybe how we should think about OpEx trends into the third quarter?\nBob McMahon: Yes. I would say, I mean, we\u2019ve been \u2013 we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs.\nMike McMullen: Yes, Bob I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\u2019re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\u2019t take shortcuts here. So we \u2013 there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\u2019ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for taking the question guys.\nMike McMullen: Sure, Dan.\nDan Brennan: I was hoping maybe to \u2013 hey, Mike, maybe to go back to China for a moment.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nDan Brennan: Can you break it down a little bit more, kind of what you\u2019re seeing in China? I know you kind of highlighted in the deck that food grew and I think you\u2019ve given some other tidbits. But maybe just give us a little flavor for your segments in China and then specifically if you could also just address maybe an update on food and generics, which had been two big drags for you guys.\nBob McMahon: Yes, I\u2019ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\u2019ve been very pleased with our performance in China.\nDan Brennan: And we throw, Bob, and thank you for that. The generic issue obviously maybe gets a little lost right now during COVID and did major\u2026\nBob McMahon: Yes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\u2019s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\u2019ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\u2019ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint.\nDan Brennan: Got it.\nJacob Thaysen: Well, I can add to that. The conservation just continued with the generics, but according to our expectations.\nDan Brennan: Yes. Got it. And I know there was already a question I think \u2013 thanks, Jacob. And then I know plenty to ask the question on the diagnostics business, but if you think about DGG ex-NASD business, obviously that business should be a lot less sensitive towards discretionary visits given the nature of what you\u2019re selling there. But can you just give us a little flavor for what you are seeing since there is such a focus on the ability for hospitals to open back up and patient visits? So what do we track there?\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think actually, hospital access for \u2013 and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\u2019s one of the areas of \u201cuncertainty\u201d we\u2019re looking at is when will those \u2013 when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\u2019ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business and that puts somewhat of a \u2013 that\u2019s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And Dan, that\u2019s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\u2019s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\u2019t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\u2019re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\u2019s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\u2019s one of the things that is still in front of us.\nDan Brennan: Terrific. Thank you, guys.\nBob McMahon: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And that\u2019s all the time that we have for questions. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

We're seeing, for example, in our service business, a lot of strong tracks which really help our customers be productive and help with startup services and actually achieve a critical component in the services. On the consumable side, we certainly saw a strong demand in China, a big snapback up on in terms of a demand for our products that are really supporting workflows. And we see this continue especially around a lot of the digital capabilities that we've developed and our way of interacting with customers. The last thing, I would mention is that also our productivity story in CrossLab about our lab enterprise business is doing extremely well.

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks, Ankur, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. I want to add my best wishes as well and hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I'm pleased to have Padraig McDonnell, our President of the Agilent CrossLab Group, joining us for the first time today. As I mentioned last quarter, Mark Doak has retired from the company and Padraig is now leading the ACG. I know you\u2019ll enjoy getting to know Padraig better in his new role. I'm glad he could be here with us on the call.  Last quarter, Agilent was among the first to discuss the business impacts of COVID-19. Since then, much has changed as COVID-19 is now a global pandemic. The world is a very different place than it was back in February. But what hasn't changed is the attitude and execution of the Agilent team and our unwavering focus in four key areas.  Let me first talk about how we are protecting our people. Our top priority is ensuring the health and safety of the Agilent team. Early on, we entered the global work-from-home policy and severely restricted travel. We implemented new work practices and safety protocols for our manufacturing teams and service engineers visiting customer laboratories. The team is really stepping up. True to the Agilent mission, our response to COVID-19 is driven by our commitment to our people and our customers.  It should be no surprise then that our second area of focus is unwavering commitment to our customers. We are and have been open for business. From the early stage of the pandemic, we took decisive action to secure our global business operations. We are using innovative and more efficient ways to support our customers, from leveraging our digital capabilities, promote technical assistance to urgently delivering Bravo liquid handler systems for their COVID-19 test or providing live online guidance to keep labs functioning. We're doubling down on our efforts to support our customers. This is especially true as their needs change and evolve.  Our third focus area is taking quick and decisive action to preserve a strong P&L and balance sheet. When we experienced significant disruption to business activity in late March, we made change in our supply chain, logistics and business operations. This ensured [indiscernible] order intake and our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. We also didn't shy away from taking swift action to reduce expenses.  We quickly put in place a cost management program while reprioritize and sustained our growth investments. As we continue to sharpen our plans, we will not put our future growth opportunities at risk. Bob will share more details, but the top priority is monitoring our liquidity and cash flow. We have taken actions to ensure a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.  The positive impact of our approach shows in our Q2 results. In the midst of the spread of the global pandemic, the Agilent team delivered Q2 revenues of $1.24 billion. This is flat on a reported basis and down a little less than 2% on a core basis. Our Q2 operating margin of 22.4% are up 50 basis points. We posted earnings per share of $0.71 during the quarter, flat versus our results a year ago.  Before covering additional Q2 detail, a few comments on our fourth key area of focus, our continued prioritization on growth. Our building and buying growth strategy remains firmly in place while we are taking decisive action on our cost structure to respond to the COVID-19 impact. We are continuing to prioritize investments in fast-growing markets such as biopharma that deliver incremental growth and help us create a more resilient business. When we all come out of this on the other side, Agilent will be poised for growth. Our Q2 pharma growth is being driven by the strength of our biopharma business. This is a direct result of our building and buying strategy in action. Our approach to investing for growth continue to serve us well and will be a major factor and help us emerge in the current environment stronger than ever. An example of our approach to continually assessing our growth investments is the decision we made regarding our cancer diagnostics strategy and the Lasergen sequencer development program. Given change in the marketplace, we believe we can now capture future growth in the NGS diagnostics space without the need our own sequencer platform. As a result, we made a decision to shutter our sequencer development program. We are redirecting our investments with the valuable intellectual property we\u2019ve created into areas of higher interest. Despite this program change, we remain optimistic about continued growth in NGS cancer diagnostics. Let\u2019s now take a closer look at the quarter as well as the future outlook in today\u2019s COVID-19 world. Last quarter, our attention and revised outlook was focused on our China team, customers and business, as COVID-19 spread to other parts of the world in the second quarter, the situation changed. During February and March, our overall business was up about 1%, however, in late March, we faced significant disruption in business activity as Europe and the Americas restricted access to facilities. Our China business is recovering better than forecasted. We posted 4% core growth in China with increasing strength throughout the quarter. In fact, in April, China posted strong growth, while all other geographies experienced declines. We expect that China growth recovery to continue throughout the year as lab operations and investments continue to resume. The near-term outlook in Europe and the U.S., however, remains challenging, particularly for new equipment parts across most end markets and non-COVID-19 diagnostic testing. Some quick highlights across our businesses, both DGG and ACG delivered core growth. DGG\u2019s 5% growth is driven by NASD, up 35% as the ramp of that business continues as planned. ACG was up 1%. Our LSAG business declined 7% as customers curtailed equipment purchases, although we did have pockets of growth in biopharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. From an end market perspective, pharma grew 5% in the quarter, followed by 4% growth in diagnostics and clinical. The food market continues its recovery with a modest 1% growth driven by China. Our environmental and forensics business is down 1% for the quarter. In Q2, academia and chemical and energy are the end markets that are most impacted, down 16% and 10%, respectively. We expect continued pressure in these markets throughout the rest of the year, although we are seeing some pockets of growth in chemical production regionally as some customers shift supply chains. Looking forward, we expect Q3 to be the most challenging quarter of the year, with gradual improvement during the course of the quarter and continuing into Q4. As a key player in the life science industry, Agilent also has an important role to play in the fight against COVID-19. Before closing, I\u2019d like to share a few thoughts on our COVID-19 offerings. While the COVID-19 virus is negatively affecting our overall growth at this time, Agilent is supporting several aspects of COVID-19 research and testing, along with therapeutic and vaccine development. In Q2, this resulted in a one-point tailwind of growth, primarily in providing instrumentation. There is potential that this will become a more meaningful tailwind in future quarters. To address this, we have mobilized across Agilent team to maximize support to customers around the globe fighting the virus. These offerings range from instrumentation, such as automation, PCR and marketplace testing to consumables and components necessary for testing as well as lab support to these customers. As we enter Q3, I want you to know that the global Agilent team is energized and remains focused on supporting our customers and driving growth. We have taken swift and decisive actions to ensure a continued strong P&L and balance sheet. We remain a diversified, resilient company with a bias for speed, execution and growth. Thank you for being on the call. I will have a few closing comments after Bob speaks, and then we look forward to taking your questions. And now, Bob, you\u2019re up. Yes, thanks, Bob. Before we take your questions, I want to close by saying that I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our Agilent team. The idea that difficult situations provide the opportunity for organizations and individuals to step up and exhibit strength, leadership and resiliency has never been more true at Agilent. The Agilent team has been tested during this crisis like no other time and they have not shied away from it. Instead, we have answered the call with world class execution, an even stronger focus on customer service and an inspired creativity that is second to none. I am absolutely convinced we will emerge from this pandemic as an even stronger force in the marketplace. And, with that, I will turn things over to Ankur so we can take your questions. Thank you. Do you want to take that one? Sure. Yes, Bob, I'll take that one. So I think for C&E for Q3, basically, we assume than it kind of looks like Q2 and with the potential that the investments that we're starting to see inclinations of a regional approach to this pandemic is really cause many parts of world to rethink their supply chain. So we're seeing early indications of moving of on shoring ensuring certain types of critical chemical components in certain geographies. So that could represent some upside I think. But basically, we're assuming kind of current situation continues into Q3. Okay. Sorry, I was going to add to that. I think when we talk about chemical and energy, it's important to keep in mind that about 70% of that segment is actually chemicals, including material testing. Yes. Well, actually you reference your conference a lot changed after the conference where we saw a number of new announcements indicating there were some changes in terms of how certain competitors in the space were thinking about access to the platform. So that caused us to rethink our current investments and we had an opportunity to really move our program forward without needing to invest directly in a sequencer platform of our own. And Bob, I'll let you comment on the financial side of that. Yes. I think from an Agilent perspective, our overall thesis of building and buying still stays intact where we'd like to deploy capital in M&A, that makes sense for the company. And we've talked about our criteria around end markets that we know, where companies that we've acquired and have higher levels of growth in the overall company average accretive. So that formula remains relatively unchanged. But we have noticed as some of these moves as well. So I think that speaks to a continued robust interest in the M&A pipeline across the industry. I'd also tell you the valuations haven't moved much. So this is not a buyer's market and you can buy things on the cheap, so you really have to be think through what you're looking at and does it make sense for the company? Anything else you'd add to that, Bob? Steve, do you have a follow-up or\u2026 Yes. That\u2019s a great question. And what we also try to think through, what\u2019s really behind the lower oil price. And I think this time, you\u2019ve got two things going on, right, which was oversupply and then really driven by, obviously, the COVID-19 and the slower growth in the economy and demand for those services. But I\u2019m really glad to get a chance to comment on the mix of our business because that segment is pretty subdued right now. But over the years, we\u2019ve continued to have more and more of our business move into the chemical side of that. So roughly about 70% of our business in C&E is in the chemical side and really saw much different dynamics in April, actually, almost all through all Q2, where the energy segment was pretty subdued where limited investment there, mainly business was carried forward through our ACG business, but really not a lot of demand on instruments, different kind of scenario on the chemical side. In my prepared remarks, we basically said we expect this segment to be subdued for the foreseeable future. So it\u2019s really just tied to events that I\u2019m just not smart enough to figure out myself, which is when does global growth start to get solidified and when does it start to turn. I think what we wanted to point out, there actually are some little glimmers of positive aspects of C&E business, particularly the COVID-19 has exposed the fragility of the world\u2019s supply chain. And we\u2019re seeing many customers and many governments, they want certain critical components made in their country and made in their region. So we are seeing indications across multiple industries of onshoring initiatives actually starting, which would speak to some longer-term growth prospects in this space. But don\u2019t get too excited. This \u2013 I would just say, let\u2019s assume that it\u2019s going to stay subdued for a while as we\u2019re thinking about it right now. Hence, the reason why we went through the guidance in Q2, because some of these are just too difficult to predict the timing of transition. Yes, yes, yes, absolutely. Absolutely. We are not capacity constrained. And now, we continue to build out the new facility in Frederick as well as optimizing our Boulder facility. And while I can\u2019t share specific names, I can tell you that there are programs underway that aren\u2019t in the revenue yet right now that are related to COVID-19 work. You are quite welcome. Hey, Derik. Yes. It\u2019s tracking well to the number that we talked about at the \u2013 or what people have estimated, ramping up to $150 million kind of run rate. It\u2019s tracking well to that. Yes. No, it was about $30 million a year. That was what was kind of forecasted this year. We\u2019ve spent basically half of that. So the second half of the year, that\u2019ll be a combination of reinvesting where appropriate and also managing the dynamic situation that we\u2019re in, in terms of COVID-19. Hey, Bob, I think we had the full cost of the program in our Q2 results, in our next quarter results. And there\u2019s some real talent in that team, and there\u2019s some really great intellectual property that we think we can really deploy in other programs. So we\u2019re looking to go forward that combo approach, as Bob mentioned. And without waiting in too deeply on the political dimension of things today, what I can tell you is we\u2019re actively scenario planning. We \u2013 under potential scenarios around changes in trade policies and supply chain. So we don\u2019t want to be caught in the reactive mode that we were when tariffs were first announced a few years ago. So our teams are really working through a number of different strategies right now. Sure, sure. Yes, a couple of things right now. So first of all, although we don\u2019t provide kits directly ourselves, we provide a lot of the components and ingredients, antibodies and other enzymes, that go into testing kits. So we\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve personally involved in a number of calls where customers and governments are looking for us to assure to supply to them. So I think we\u2019ve got a good feel for the demand that we\u2019re seeing out there. Relative to our own employees, right now, we\u2019re not requiring employees to be tested for \u2013 return in the office. Just a reminder, about 85% of the employees now are, for Agilent, are working from home, and we\u2019re going to be very, very careful on phasing in the return to office. So we\u2019re thinking this through. Once more routine testing does become available, that\u2019s probably something we would look at pretty closely. But we\u2019re in no hurry right now because our teams are working from home right now. Relative \u2013 it\u2019s funny. We keep asking that question of our \u2013 particularly our service teams, and that has not come up yet. So we\u2019re continuing to monitor. But right now, we\u2019re not seeing requests from our customers to have any type of testing done prior to our employees coming onto the site. Clearly, we have to follow that our safety protocols, and we offered our team with the right PPE and the right training. But on the testing side, we\u2019ve not yet seen that. You\u2019re pretty at good math, Dan. Dan, thanks for the follow-up question. I do trust the trend in China. So I hope that didn\u2019t come through that way in my remarks. So actually\u2026 No, no. That was sort of the worst-case scenario that Bob was trying to put together this framework, said, well, we could be wrong. And if it\u2019s wrong, we \u2013 this is what the implications would be. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re wrong. But if in case we were wrong, this is \u2013 you see that far end of the framework that Bob described. But in fact, Q2 China growth was better than we had expected, and we believe it\u2019s going to continue to return to higher levels of growth throughout the quarter. And I hope a few of you noticed that the China food also grew in Q2. Absolutely. Hey, Doug. How are you doing? And I think Bob, it\u2019s \u2013 maybe this is worth mentioning that we don\u2019t go in a lot of details on the order front, our order forecast have been tracking well for both April and through this point in time through May. So, yes. You can draw a parallel, where things are opening up. You see the consumables recovering. It\u2019s recovering much faster than the instrumentation. And that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s why we keep using word uncertainty, because we can\u2019t project exactly how certain facilities will open up. But we know when they opened up in China, we\u2019ve gotten the business. We know as they\u2019ve been opening up in Europe, we\u2019re getting the business. And then when they\u2019ve slowly been opened up in the U.S. but getting the business, with the exception being universities, which aren\u2019t opening up right now, unless you\u2019re doing COVID-19 research. Yes, Doug. Thanks for the observations there, because there is a big footprint of the business in academia, but the overall business did grow. And I think I\u2019d like to give the opportunity to Jacob to crow a little about what\u2019s going on there. Thanks, Jacob. Thanks. Hi, Puneet. How are you doing. Sam, I think the answer is no, but I\u2019m going to \u2013 you haven\u2019t had a chance to talk today. So why don\u2019t you confirm or deny this room or around. Yes, I\u2019ll make some initial comments, and I\u2019ll invite Sam to join in here as well. So I guess, first of all, important just to remind the audience we actually do have a cancer diagnosis business with day from an NGS perspective. So we provide a lot of components and sample prep and other instrumentation into these workflows today. We\u2019re overall very \u2013 we continue to be very, very bullish about the cancer diagnostics market for NGS-based \u2013 cancer-based diagnostics. And we think there\u2019s a path forward for incremental growth on top of what we\u2019re doing that doesn\u2019t require a \u2013 or having our own sequencer, because of some change in the external marketplace. And Sam, maybe you have some building comments on that. So that demand has not peaked, and it comes not only with instrumentation, but an ongoing supply of consumables associated with an instrumentation. Sure, Vijay. No problem. No, significant disruption, but it\u2019s relatively flattish I think for the quarter, that\u2019s about 70% of our pharma business, about 30% it was growing quite strongly in biopharma, small molecule is relatively flattish on the instrumentation side. Yes, Bob I could just jump in there. I mean, the fact that we were able to increase margins in the quarter in the midst of a pandemic, we\u2019re really quite pleased with that. And we didn\u2019t take shortcuts here. So we \u2013 there was no COVID-19 layoffs within Agilent. And we\u2019ve got a team that is not worried about their future employment. They are all worried about winning the marketplace and taking care of our customers. Thanks. Sure, Dan. Sure. Yes. I think actually, hospital access for \u2013 and patients willingness to go to the hospital, medical care outside of COVID-19 has put a damper on the U.S. business in pathology. So that\u2019s one of the areas of \u201cuncertainty\u201d we\u2019re looking at is when will those \u2013 when will patients start to return to hospital to get those procedures done. We saw that resume, I believe Bob in Europe. But we\u2019ve not yet seen it in the pathology U.S. business and that puts somewhat of a \u2013 that\u2019s put a drag on our Q2 results. We were quite pleased to post a 5% core growth in that business, despite this drag in the U.S., which we think eventually is going to come back. But again, this is when."

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I want to repeat what Mike and Ankur said and hoping that you are doing well and staying safe. Looking forward, I, for one, am confident we will get through this and look forward to the day when we can follow up these calls with face-to-face meetings again. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the second quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics, and then finish up with a framework for thinking about Q3. Given the current volatility and uncertainty that exists, we\u2019re not going to be providing specific forward-looking guidance today. That said, in the spirit of trying to be helpful and transparent, we will provide a glimpse into the evolution of our business during the second quarter and our thought process and how things may play out in the coming quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Reported revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, which was flat versus last year on a reported basis. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 1.6 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.3 percentage points to growth. On a core basis, revenue declined 1.7% in the quarter. The pacing of revenue during the quarter varies significantly by region driven by where each region was in the cycle of precautionary measures, being taken to slow their spread of the virus. As we previously disclosed, we saw overall business activity slow in late March, driven by the U.S. and Europe. The stay-at-home measures in those regions reduce lab operations and limited lab access and our ability to install equipment. This lower level of business activity carry through the month of April resulting in double digit declines for the month in those regions. On the other hand, and as we had anticipated business activity picked up throughout the quarter in China, as restrictions were slowly lifted. We saw strong growth in China in April, partially due to catch up from lower business volumes in February and March. Overall, China grew 4% for the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations at the start of Q2. In total for Q2, quarter-to-date results through March were up 1%, while April was down roughly 6.5%, resulting in the 1.7% core decline. Before getting into some additional group details, it\u2019s also important to note while we have seen some order push outs, we have not seen increased order cancellations. While there are always some level of cancellations in both March and April cancellations were actually lower than the previous year. Our resilient business model was extremely important to us as we navigated the effects of a challenging environment. As Mike mentioned, DGG and ACG both grew on a core basis, while LSAG instrument business declined. LSAG declined 7% core in the quarter, but did see some bright spots with growth in large molecule pharma, cell analysis and COVID-19 testing and research. In addition as Mike mentioned, we had modest growth in the food market. For LSAG the impact of COVID-19 related closures was most pronounced in the Academia and government and chemical and energy markets. ACG grew 1% with China growing in the high single digits. Our ACG results were negatively affected by delays and installations and lab closures in Europe and the Americas during the quarter. And I\u2019m pleased to say that our DDG business delivered 5% growth during Q2, and it was on track for double digit growth prior to the slowdown in U.S. and Europe. We saw sequential growth in genomics, boosted by products used to develop testing capabilities and for vaccine research into COVID-19. And as Mike mentioned, our NASD ramp remains on track and delivered excellent growth this quarter as well. The pathology business grew in all regions except for the U.S. where the affects of delayed and non-COVID-19 related medical procedures was more pronounced in April. On a geographic basis, all regions ranged from flat to down 4% for the quarter with Europe down 4%, Americas down 1% and Asia Pacific flat. And within Asia, as we mentioned, China grew 4%. Now let\u2019s turn to the rest of the P&L. As the expanded impact of the pandemic became apparent, we moved quickly and decisively to adjust our cost trucker through targeted discretionary spending program reductions. We continue to invest in our key growth opportunities and important capabilities, such as digital. For example, we leverage digital and virtual reality investments for our field service engineers to continue to support our customers where we did not have physical lab access. While we took actions across the P&L, we focus most of our effort on SG&A. R&D investments as a percentage of revenue were largely unchanged from the prior year. As a result operating margins of 22.4% improved 50 basis points over last year on flat revenue. Gross margin at 55.4% was down 60 basis points versus the prior year, mostly due to volume and the revenue mix shifting more towards services. In addition, we saw higher logistics costs as moving goods internationally became more expensive. This combination of factors resulted in non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.71 per share flat with the number we posted a year ago. Now in terms of the balance sheet, we were in the market early in the quarter, repurchasing 1.66 million shares for $126 million. In late March, however, we suspended all our share repurchases to maximize our liquidity and financial position. While not in our current plans for Q3, we continue to monitor and evaluate when repurchases will resume. We generated $313 in operating cash flow during the quarter, which is a $61 million improvement over last year, despite building some raw material inventory to assure supply. Additionally, we've taken steps to reduce our capital spending by roughly one-third for the rest of the year. In addition, we ended the quarter in a strong position with $2.1 billion in available liquidity, including $1.3 billion in cash and roughly $800 million available under our revolving credit facility. Our net leverage ratio as defined by net debt to EBITDA was 0.9 times. Given our cash flows and our strong financial position, there is no change to our dividend. As you may recall, we withdrew our 2020 guidance in mid-April due to the uncertainty surrounding the duration and severity of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the global economic environment. While various countries have started working towards reopening, the pace and effect of global reopening efforts is still unknown. So we won't be providing guidance for Q3 or the full year. However, we did want to provide a framework and a range of possibilities for how our business could unfold in the coming quarter. When we look at Q3, we expect May to be very similar and the business activity is very similar to April and the business activity we've seen in the first few weeks of the month confirmed that. We anticipate that China will remain ahead of the curve in terms of economic recovery, relative to the rest of the world. We expect pharma and our services, particularly contracted services, which make up the majority of our service revenue to remain resilient. And we will be following the consumables business very closely to monitor early signs of recovery and demand patterns. A combination of these factors could result in our revenues being down between 5% and 15% on a core basis. At the lower end of the decline, we assume activity in June and July will continue to improve, with the COVID-19 offerings Mike mentioned having a more significant impact than the 1$ contribution in Q2. On the higher end of the decline, we\u2019re building in the assumption that there would be no significant improvement throughout the course of the quarter in the U.S., and Europe, that non-COVID-19 testing would not recover, and China would plateau. While this is a wide range, there is still significant uncertainty in the pace of recovery as the U.S., and Europe are currently lifting restrictions. We hope that the 15% decline proves very conservative but wanted to provide you with some of the assumptions we are using to manage going forward. In Q3, we expect a two-point headwind due to exchange rates, and M&A should be a three-point tailwind. Again, this is not formal guidance, but should give you a sense for some of the variables we are looking at within the business and believe this is the best way to view the third quarter given the uncertainties that exist. As Mike said, we also believe that fiscal year as the world works through reopening the economy. Overall, I feel we are very well positioned to deal with this challenging environment, accelerate market share gains and come out even stronger as the global economy recovers. Before I turn the call back over to Mike, I want to conclude by saying Agilent\u2019s performance for the first two quarters truly shows the resiliency of our company. I also want to thank the Agilent team for remaining focused on supporting our customers during this time. And, I\u2019d be remiss without a shout out to the finance team for being able to close the books in such a professional manner with everyone working from home. We\u2019ve taken the actions that will serve us incredibly well through the rest of 2020 and into the future. And with that, I believe Mike would like to share some final thoughts before we move on to the Q&A. Mike? Yes. Thank you, Tycho. And this is Bob, I'll take the question. I'll actually take the second question first around NASD. The NASD growth is on the ramp that we had talked about previously. It actually had nothing to do with COVID-19 testing or research. It's mostly the activities that have continued in our pipeline of products and clinical testing that has happened. And we're very pleased with the progress there. So that has nothing to do with the COVID-19 testing. On the first question that you had, again, this isn't guidance it's kind of a range of scenarios that we're planning. And we hope that the bottom end of that or the minus 15% would be very conservative. If you look at, we are expecting May to be very similar to April, which would hopefully be the bottom and then improvement in June and July. And but if there are relapses, if China does relapse, or there is a slowdown in that growth that would be the bottom end of the range. So it's a wider range than we would normally have. But there's obviously very much a lot of uncertainty around the forecast. Yes, Tyco, if you look \u2013 if we took our chemical and energy end market and looked at the first two months versus April, they were roughly the same. So we said it was down 10% in the quarter. It didn't have a material change in April. One of the businesses that did was academia and government. So academia and government with the lab closures and so forth was worse in April than it was in other markets. But chemical and energy was pretty steady throughout the quarter now albeit down. Yes. It is a full shut down and we will have a write-off in Q2. Yes. I'll take the first question in terms of the pacing, Steve and you're right. What we have seen is that the pacing by region really follows kind of how the pandemic spread and then how the countries are coming back. And so what we saw was a more pronounced, obviously in China that has \u2013 I wouldn't call it a snapback, but it's a recovery. And we're actually seeing the same thing in Europe, where Europe, we felt more of the pain, and that it's actually coming back faster. And then the U.S., and now we're starting to see some of the U.S., it\u2019s still very early days in the U.S., but you are seeing kind of that \u2013 that kind of wave of recovery happening throughout the course of each one of the regions. And I'll turn it over to Padraig to give a chance to talk about the CrossLab\u2019s business, but we remain incredibly bullish about that business. And I think even more so now, given some of the proof points that we have in terms of being able to support our customers, both directly and through our digital means. Padraig? And Steve, let me add just one other thing. In the case, obviously ACG grew 1%, it would have been stronger \u2013 several points stronger. We did have some deferrals because we couldn't install the equipment and we recognize a portion of the price for the service, the training and installation and so forth. And so that is revenue that is on the balance sheet today and it will come back to us in the course of Q3 and Q4. Yes. And I would say, Patrick, just on that, obviously, the more subdued piece is the instrumentation\u2026 And we will see the snapback or the improvement first in the ACG business. That\u2019s correct. Yes. I\u2019ll \u2013 hey Derik, this is Bob. Yes. I\u2019ll take the first one, and I\u2019ll leave the second one to Mike. I think on the pharmaceutical one, we\u2019re actually watching that very closely. It\u2019s different than the chemical side because I think the chemical side will probably move a little faster than this. Obviously, there\u2019s regulations, but you are seeing discussions about that even as recently as earlier this week about the U.S. providing a contract here in the U.S. for some APIs and so forth. So we actually think \u2013 we\u2019re watching that closely, and we think that, that could be an opportunity for us as those new labs or capacity come out, because our offering here is, I think, second to none, and so more to come there. It\u2019s probably not as fast-moving, but we certainly is on our radar screen. Yes. You\u2019re in the ballpark. Yes, we haven\u2019t seen any continue \u2013 again, these are one point out of the month, right, but \u2013 or one point out of a year. But May is trending the way April trended in total. And so we\u2019re not seeing anything that is dramatically off pace. Yes. I would say, generally speaking, our consumables business has started to pick up. And I\u2019ll just leave it at that. Correct. Hey, Puneet, this is Bob. Just to add on to what Sam said, because there\u2019s been a lot of news about clinical trials being put on hold and so forth. We haven\u2019t seen any of that in our demand for NASD. Yes. Hey, Puneet. This is Bob. I\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s in the LSAG bucket. And that was the majority of the instrument of the COVID-19 testing that Mike talked about one-point tailwind in Q2 and growing. So\u2026 It wouldn\u2019t \u2013 Vijay, you wouldn\u2019t, that would be kind of the \u2013 towards the lower end, right? So what we\u2019re saying is, if things kind of backtracked, we didn\u2019t get any better in the U.S. and Europe and we didn\u2019t really have \u2013 there was a sort of a backtrack in China. So again, we\u2019re saying we don\u2019t expect that. We hope that that\u2019s very conservative. But things are just now opening up in U.S. and Europe. But if you do the math that you\u2019re saying, you don\u2019t get there, you get a lot better. You get towards the minus 5%. Yes. We haven\u2019t heard any specifics on that. So that clearly would be a boost to our view of market demand the latter part of this year, but that\u2019s not at all in our calculus right now when we talk about a recovering China marketplace for us. Yes. We \u2013 our business in India is fairly small today. Yes. I would say, I mean, we\u2019ve been \u2013 we were very pleased with our ability to kind of manage the kind of the cost structure here. If you looked at it kind of on a sequential basis, there was about a $35 million kind of reduction, about a third of that quite honestly was travel related. As we put the brakes on and I would expect that to be probably even more significant in Q3. Obviously variable and then discretionary spend and then we do have some element of our variable comps that reduces with performance. But what I would say is, Q3 is going to be more challenging because we are protecting those growth investments. But we are very pleased with our ability to kind of manage our costs. Yes, I\u2019ll take it Dan. What I would say is, in the quarter we were very pleased with the performance. All three business groups grew with DGG, albeit, the smallest one growing the fastest followed by ACG and LSAG was up a modest percentage, which is a great testament to the team there. Across the groups all, but I think Academia and government grew to varying levels. And food as we talked about was up in China and it helped drive the global food being up. So again, very good recovery there. And we\u2019ve been very pleased with our performance in China. Yes. From a generic perspective, pharma was up it\u2019s really driven by the biopharma business. But our small molecule was not significantly impacted. As Mike said, our small molecule business was roughly flat globally and it was not that far off in China as well. Again, we\u2019ve got the view that now COVID-19 kind of throws some variables in here, but we\u2019ve continued to have the view that this ultimately is a good thing long-term for the industry and ultimately for us because we continue to see the customers who win are disproportionally our customers. And nothing really changed in Q2 from that standpoint. Yes. And Dan, that\u2019s one of the variables that we were taking to account with the framework that we were talking about. If in fact, the large labs continue to focus on COVID-19 testing or there\u2019s not any resumption of non-COVID-19 medical procedures, then that will impact our pathology business because right now, biopsies aren\u2019t being done. Cancer screening is being deferred. And then if you have cancer, then you go for a biopsy and so forth. We\u2019re hoping that that will resume throughout the course of this quarter. But it\u2019s still very early days. Ultimately we see that as bad for the healthcare of the world, quite honestly. And so we hope not just as manufacturers, but as brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers that happens. But that\u2019s one of the things that is still in front of us. Welcome."

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And now, I would like to introduce you to the host for today's conference, Ankur Dhingra, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead. Thanks.\nAnkur Dhingra: Thank you Julianne. Welcome everyone to Agilent's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of Agilent's Life Science and Applied Markets Group and Sam Raha, President of Agilent's Diagnostics and Genomics Group. Due to certain personal engagements, Mark Doak, President of the Agilent's CrossLab Group, is unavailable to join us today. You can find the press release, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year. Revenue growth will be referred to on either reported or core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and the acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of January 31. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike McMullen: Thanks Ankur and thanks everyone, for joining us on our call today. I would like to start today's call with a reminder that Mark Doak, ACG Group President, will be retiring on May 1. While Mark and his wife are currently enjoying a long planned location and is not able join us today, I would be remiss in not taking the opportunity to recognize the outstanding accomplishments Mark has made in his stellar 38-year. His track record of results speak for itself. Thank you, Mark. We have a very strong bench at Agilent and have already named Mark's successor, Padraig McDonnell. Padraig knows the business well. He has been on Mark's staff for several years and is currently running out chemistries and supplies division. Padraig and Mark are already working on transition activities as Padraig prepares to take the helm of the ACG business at the start of fiscal Q3. Our congratulations to both Mark and Padraig. And now on to the quarterly results. The Agilent team delivered a strong start to 2020. Q1 revenues are above our expectations as business grew in all regions and markets. Total revenues of $1.36 billion are up 5.7% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2.4% on a core basis. We continue to translate our topline growth into strong bottomline earnings. Our EPS of $0.81 is up 7% and is at the high-end of our guidance. Before going into business units and market details of our quarterly results, I want to speak about two specific areas that highlight how our building and buying strategy of investing in fast-growing markets continues to deliver growth and help us create a more resilient business. First, I want to talk about our most recent acquisition, BioTek. This was the first quarter with the BioTek team onboard and the business is off to a very strong start with revenue growth above our expectations. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the cell analysis space and BioTek continues the strong momentum that originally got us interested in bring them into Agilent. The BioTek leadership team was just in Santa Clara for a few days of planned meetings and they are very energized and excited about the future possibilities to make it a great business even stronger as part of the Agilent. Second, the resiliency of our business model is on full display this quarter as Agilent delivered strong growth and earnings in the face of a negative Q1 impact from the Coronavirus outbreak in China. As this has dominated headlines, let me add a few additional comments regarding the Coronavirus and its impact on Agilent. Most importantly, our thoughts go out to all those affected by the Coronavirus. On the Agilent front, our team fortunately has not had any direct health impact and many returned to work last week. We are remotely supporting our customers as a number of them gradually resume operations. We have also restarted our in-country production activities and they are shipping products to customers within China and internationally, albeit at a reduced rate. On the business side, given that our first quarter ended January 31, we are seeing business impact across both fiscal quarters, Q1 and Q2. In Q1, our revenues are running ahead of expectations right up to Lunar New Year Holiday. However, the extensive Lunar New Year Holiday affects our customers' ability to transact and accept shipments during the last days of the quarter. This reduced our reported revenue by approximately $10 million in total for the quarter, primarily in our LSAG instrument business. We have since recognized the bulk of this revenue now in Q2. Looking ahead, we are projecting that Coronavirus will continue to impact our China business throughout Q2. Bob will share additional details, but we are anticipating delays in new equipment purchases and a slower uptake of consumables and services. The slower uptake is due to reduced number of selling days resulting from the extension of Lunar New Year, along with customer and logistics operations that are ramping, but not yet fully operational. It's important to note, while we are forecasting the impact to our Q2 business, our full year outlook for total Agilent revenues and EPS remains unchanged. Our business outside of China remains on a solid footing and we believe a large portion of our China business that is currently being impacted by the Coronavirus is not lost but rather is delayed. As you know, the Coronavirus outbreak is unfortunately impacting the health and safety of tens of thousands of people. I am very proud of how the Agilent team has responded to do our part to help. Our Agilent China team is now actually supporting those customers during crucial research into the virus. We have donated instruments and supplies to four clinical and research institutions based in China to support these research and drug development efforts. We continue to closely monitor events in China and are prepared to act quickly to help wherever possible. Now on to additional details of our quarterly results. Agilent's growth is broad-based as our business grew across all regions and end markets. Regional performance was led by the Americas posting 5% core growth with America coming in with low single digit results and Asia holding steady. Despite the timing of the Lunar New Year and the Coronavirus impact late in the quarter, our China business grew low single digits. While all end markets grew, our results were led by strong growth in the biopharma and environmental forensics markets. Now taking a closer look at how the individual business units performed. LSAG revenues grew 5% on a reported basis driven my strong performance in our biopharma and cell analysis business. On a core basis, LSAG's revenues were down 2% against a tough compare and inclusive of the unexpected Q1 impact from the Coronavirus. With the exception of China, all regions and end markets performed in line with expectations. The ACG business continues to deliver strong results, posting 7% core growth even with reduced selling days in China. This growth was broad-based across all major market segments and regions. These results continue to demonstrate the strength of our ACG CrossLab strategy and how we are leading the transformation of the analytical lab. DGG has also posted 7% growth in the quarter against a difficult 12% growth compare. We have experienced a continuation of positive trends winning share on our core pathology business and seeing strength our NGS QA/QC franchise. We continue to be pleased with the revenue ramp at our new oligo manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado. In addition to driving strong finance results, I want to highlight some other notable events that took place during the quarter. We continue to bring different and new product to the market, meaning strong customer and external recognition. We just introduced the Agilent SureSelect XT HS2 DNA kit. This, along with our recently launched automated sample prep platform, Magnis, further strengthens our leadership position in the NGS sample prep market. In addition, two industry publication honored the Agilent InfinityLab LC/MSD iQ system with 2019 innovation awards. The award-winning mass spectrometer introduced last June incorporates intelligent design and innovations such as embedded sensors that monitor instrument health. And finally, earlier this month, Barron's name Agilent number one in the list of the 2019 Most Sustainable Companies in America. We are very proud of this recognition. Sustainability is a critical topic that is gaining increased interest from customers, employees and investors. More importantly, we believe focusing on sustainability is simply the right thing to do. Before I pass the call on to Bob, I would like to close with a reminder of Agilent's resilience and our shareholder value creation model, delivering above market growth, expanding operating margins and a balanced deployment of capital. We are able to thrive by focusing on platforms with multiple large end markets and long term growth opportunities. We are also driving growth in the aftermarket, increasing our focus on faster growing end markets, streamlining our infrastructure and operations and investing in the future of Agilent, both organically and inorganically. We do all this while maintaining acute focus on delivering EPS growth with superior quality of earnings and driving shareholder value creation. Despite the temporary business uncertainty created by the Coronavirus in China, I remain confident about the longer term growth prospects of the China market, our China growth strategy and most importantly our team. I am very proud and confident in the strength and resiliency of our China team and their ability to overcome any near term challenges that come our way. When I look at our global team in our business, our growth prospects and team have never been stronger. We are laser focused on driving revenue and earnings growth. I am pleased to tell you that all these facts allow us to maintain our growth and earnings outlook for the year. Thank you for being on the call and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the call to Bob. Bob?\nBob McMahon: Thank you Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with our updated guidance for Q2 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Our first quarter results were very good as we had strong execution across all regions and markets. Revenue for the quarter was $1.36 billion with reported revenue growth of 5.7%. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 0.4 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.7 percentage points to growth. Our core growth was 2.4% in the quarter. As Mike indicated, our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year Holiday due to the Coronavirus. This reduced the number of shipping days in China and we estimate it shifted $10 million in revenue out of Q1. If not for the reduced shipping days in Q1, our performance would have been stronger with the shift affecting our core revenue growth by roughly 70 basis points. In terms of end markets, we saw growth across all of our six end market segments. Pharma, environmental and forensics and diagnostics and clinical led the way for us in the first quarter. During the quarter, pharma grew 3%, double digit growth in DGG and high single digit growth in ACG, offset a mid single digit decline for LSAG. Within pharma, our biopharma or large molecule segment grew high single digits. And on a geographic basis, our pharma business experienced high single-digit growth in the Americas and mid single digit growth in Europe. This was partially offset by mid single digit decline in China, largely associated with the timing of the Lunar New Year and to a lesser extent the execution of the 4+7 program. The 4+7 program is playing out as we expected with the third round completed in January and multiple winners per drug. We continue to believe that this is a long-term positive for the industry as drug quality improves and access to healthcare increases. Our environmental and forensics business grew 4% against a very tough compare last year of 10%. During the quarter, we saw balanced growth between instruments and aftermarket sales. And diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 3% against a strong 11% compare last year. Mid single digit growth in DGG, driven by continued share gains in our pathology business, were partially offset by declines in LSAG and ACG with both only having small businesses in this segment. Chemical and energy revenue grew 2%. Services and consumables grew mid single digits offset by flat instrument sales. Academia and government grew 1% with services and consumables growing mid single digits, partially offset by flat instrument sales. Mid single digit growth in the Americas was partially offset by flat to low single digit declines in the other regions. And finally, food returned a modest growth, up 1%. Low teens growth in services and consumables was partially offset by declines in instrumentation. While one quarter does not make a trend, we are pleased with the continual progress in this market. On a geographic basis, we saw growth in all regions, led by Americas growing mid single digits. Europe grew 2%, in line with our expectations. And as Mike mentioned, our business in China was running ahead of expectations through the first two months of fiscal 2020. As mentioned earlier, despite the shift of the $10 million, China still grew 1%. If not for the extension of the Lunar New Year, our core growth in China would have been solidly mid single digits. Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 55.7%, down 120 basis points versus the prior year. This is a result of the planned startup costs for our new NASD facility as well as product mix and some negative pricing effects on our instrumentation business. We offset 90 basis points as we leveraged our cost basis in operating expenses. And as a result, our operating margin was 22.9%, down slightly from 23.1% in the first quarter of last year. Adjusting for the $10 million Coronavirus impact on revenue, operating margins would have increased versus the prior year and so we feel good about our continued opportunity to expand operating margins. We were also able to lower our tax rate slightly to 15.5% and expect that rate to continue for the rest of the year. This resulted a non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.81, at the top end of our guidance and representing 7% growth. Before turning to second quarter guidance, I want to touch on a few other financial metrics. Our operating cash flow was an outflow of $59 million, in line with expectations as we incurred the one-time tax outflow of $226 million related to the transfer of intangibles as noted last quarter. We also paid out $56 million in dividends and purchased 726,000 shares for $60 million. We ended the quarter in a net debt position and a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times. Now let's turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for Q2. We are anticipating revenues in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion in the second quarter. This range is larger than we have traditionally provided as we have been tempted to estimate an impact of the Coronavirus on our business in the second quarter. As this is a fluid situation, we thought it would be helpful to detail all our assumptions, particularly as we have seen impact across both Q1 and Q2. Our guidance contemplates a $25 million to $50 million impact in our first half of our fiscal year, which translates to roughly to a 1.5 to three week impact on China revenues. Of this, we saw $10 million in Q1 and we are estimating a net $15 million to $40 million incremental impact in Q2. The Q2 revenue range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion translates into reported growth of 3.4% to 6.6% with core growth of 1% to 4%. Currency is expected to have a negative 1.1% impact while M&A is expected to contribute 3.5% to 3.7% in the quarter. We are estimating the Coronavirus to negatively impact our Q2 core growth by one to three points. Our revenue outlook translates Q2 earnings in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share, 1.4% to 7% growth versus last year. Importantly, as Mike mentioned, we believe the majority of this business is not lost, rather delayed as customers and the government ramp and recover. In addition, our business outside of China remains strong. As such, we expect a larger second half of the year and are not changing our full year guidance for revenue or EPS. So before starting up the call for questions, I want to conclude by saying we have a very solid start to the year that shows the strength and breadth of our portfolio. It is that portfolio, coupled with the strength of the Agilent team that, despite the uncertainty caused by the Coronavirus, we are maintaining our full year outlook. With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A.\nAnkur Dhingra: Thanks Bob. For Q&A, I would like to request to limit to one question and maybe one quick follow-up. Julianne, if you can please provide instructions for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hi. Thanks. I appreciate you guys quantifying the corona impact. I guess, a couple of things. I mean you have previously talked about mid single digit China expectations for the full year. So should we assume that's still the case, just more back-end loaded? And then, Mike, as we think about collateral damage within China, how should we think about the C&E market, just given that the broader economic activity in China is slowing? So should we think about some impact on C&E as well?\nMike McMullen: Sure, Tycho. I think I will handle both questions. And Bob, correct me if I go off script here. But I think we still think that the mid single digit number is doable for the year in China. What we are seeing already on ground from our team, I was just on the phone today with our team in China, we are still able to transact and orders are actually coming in as forecast. I think that we think a lot of the procurement is going to occur a little bit later in the year. We think a lot of it's recoverable with the exception of probably some aspects of our service business where customers really are looking for service people to arrive on the sites. I think we feel pretty good about how we are thinking about China throughout the rest of the year, albeit it being a very fluid situation. And you know, we really haven't seen any kind of transitory or connected impact on C&E. In fact, C&E actually did better than we were thinking in the first quarter. It's too early to call it a trend but some of the PMIs are actually inching up which would maybe give an indication of perhaps a better outlook and some initial noise in some of our major accounts about thinking on procurement. But we still remain cautious in terms of the outlook for C&E but I am f encouraged by the Q1 results. And again, we are not really seeing significant movements around in that area on a global basis. And we think back to the first comment on China, we weren't expecting a lot in C&E this year in China anyway. So I think we are in pretty solid shape relative to the outlook there as well.\nTycho Peterson: And then a follow-up on biopharma. You grew 3% on a 10% comp. Last quarter, it was 7% on a 14% comp. So you know, was that a pull forward last quarter? And if so, can you maybe just talk to that dynamic?\nMike McMullen: You know, I think the big story there is China, right.\nBob McMahon: Yes. That's exactly right, Mike. There's two elements there. One is the shifting of the Lunar New Year from Q2 into Q1 as well as the extension of the Lunar New Year Holiday. So those are the two primary pieces.\nMike McMullen: Yes. And then within the pharma numbers, Tycho, the biopharma segment really was strong for us again this quarter as well. And then we think as the 4+7 initiative rolls out in the latter part of this year, then we will see the growth in the small molecule side of that space. And then, we have really strong growth in NASD and the ACG business is strong in pharma. So we are feeling pretty good about pharma.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Thank you Tycho.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is open.\nMike McMullen: Hi Doug.\nRyan Blicker: Hi. This is Ryan, on for Doug. Thanks for taking my question.\nMike McMullen: How are you, Ryan?\nRyan Blicker: Maybe just to round out the China dynamic quickly, can you provide some more color on your supply chain exposure? Within China, it sounds like the operating environment is improving. But how should we think about your direct and indirect supply chain exposure? And do you see any risk to your ability to fulfill demand within and outside of China over the course of this year?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Sure, Ryan. Thanks for that question. So as I touched briefly on my call script, we actually have resumed production and are in a really solid position now to not only ship the product to our customers in China, but also products that are manufactured in China to have them exported into the global market environment. And as we have a very diversified global footprint in terms of supply chain and manufacturing capabilities, we think the near term, we are in pretty solid shape relative to ability to meet our commitments from a he shipment perspective. And then you also may recall that starting with the initiation of the U.S. based tariffs, we actually had initiated a movement of a lot of our supply chain out of China. So it actually has mitigated our risk here as well.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Ryan, this is Bob. Just to follow-up, we have twice weekly calls with our team in China, inclusive of logistics as well as our supply chain. And obviously, it's quite dynamic but as it currently stands today, we feel like we have the ability to be able to procure not only raw materials but also produce the finished goods and ship not only within China but also get product into China and vice versa.\nRyan Blicker: Great. And then maybe just following up with a brief two-parter. Number one, on the food market. It sounds like things were improving a bit prior to this Coronavirus dynamic. Can you talk a little bit more about what you are seeing in the market and if you think that the China portion of that market specifically could be poised to return to growth as we get past this Coronavirus dynamic? And then specifically for gross margin, can you talk about what the timing headwind was for the quarter versus the other dynamics that you called out? Thank you.\nMike McMullen: You want to take this, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Yes. So on food, as I mentioned, we certainly are pleased with the progress we have had several quarters of kind of very predictable performance there. And actually Q1, despite the Coronavirus, it probably had more impact on the pharma side then in food. It grew 1% on a global basis. It was down slightly in China, but certainly not to the level that it had been in the past. So we feel good about that. It's probably too early to call that it's going to return to growth. Long term, we do believe it will return to growth, but not ready to call that in this fiscal year. In terms of the timing of the Coronavirus, that $10 million, that was quite a large incremental because we had all the costs. So that was probably a higher than normal kind of incremental drop to the bottomline. And that was probably a little over $0.01 of impact on the full quarter.\nRyan Blicker: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Hi. Good afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon Jack.\nJack Meehan: Hi. I was hoping could you give us an update on the NASD rollout at the new site and how much that contributed to the quarter in both DGG and the pharma end market?\nMike McMullen: So as I imagine, you maybe getting a little tired of hearing this from Bob and myself. I am going to pull Sam into this conversation. But as we highlighted in the call script, the NASD business continues to ramp as we would expect. We are really pleased with the progress and how we are starting to fill out that factory. Still not yet at full capacity, operating at full capacity yet but it was a contributor to our growth in the first quarter, no doubt. And Sam, anything else you would like to add there?\nSam Raha: No. Mike, you hit the nail the head. The business is performing as we have expected. We continue to see interest in all the customers, the pharma customers that we have given tours to. We are doing work now there for a number of customers. Not to be boring, nothing new to report. It is progressing as per plan.\nMike McMullen: So all good news right now.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I would just add, Jack. You know, as we have talked about, this will ramp up and be a more material impact in the second half of the year. It's progressing as we expected it. It had a slight impact to the DGG and a slight impact to the overall Agilent organic core growth and we are very pleased with the progress.\nMike McMullen: Yes. And Bob, I think I will just make this one more point too, while we look at the second half outlook for the business, it's not all about China recovery. The other elements of the business, including NASD, which we know we are going to have a strong second half.\nBob McMahon: That's right.\nJack Meehan: Great. One follow-up on DGG. You know, the core growth of 7%, not to nitpick it too much but was there any thing that was a little softer in the quarter in that segment, just knowing some of the other growth drivers relative to how the segment was growing last year?\nMike McMullen: I think it was really -- this is Mike, Jack and Sam feel free to jump in on this. We had 12% growth last year, so tough compares. We had solid growth across all elements of that business. And outside of again may be a China impact for an element of the business, things are firing on all cylinders also across the businesses is how I recall.\nSam Raha: Yes. That's right, Mike. We continue to have good growth, you know, with market, above market with our overall NGS portfolio. So we feel good about that. And the low double digits, our pathology business, as you heard on Mike's opening comments and Bob's as well, we believe we will continue to gain share there growing in the mid single digits. And you just heard about NASD. So you look at the major parts of DGG, we had I think a really well-balanced good quarter.\nMike McMullen: It mainly is a comparison story.\nJack Meehan: Great. Thank you guys.\nMike McMullen: No problem.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDan Leonard: Hi. Thank you. So just a couple of things to circle back to. One, what decelerated in the Americas in the quarter? Your growth rate in that region had been trending higher than 5% for quite some time.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hi. Dan. Welcome back and appreciate the question. It was really a combination of a very tough compare. I would say probably the area that was a little softer was the instrumentation business. They had the most difficult compare in the first quarter and we would expect that to improve in Q2 through Q4 as we get to easier compares.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I know, Jacob you were looking into this.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. And I think the continued depressed PMI certainly impacts C&E business, chemical and energy business. So we continue to see that in U.S. being performing at least flat and we would like to see improvement. But I think it's going to still take some time for that to happen.\nMike McMullen: And I would add that you know, it ended where we expected it to be.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, sure.\nDan Leonard: And then a related question. Bob you mentioned when discussing the gross margin dynamics that there were some negative pricing effects on the instrument business. Can you elaborate on that? Are you pulling maybe the pricing lever to drive more demand in the instrument business after four quarters in a row of very soft demanded at LSAG?\nMike McMullen: Hi Dan, I just can't help but to jump in on this one. And I think that question should be posed to our competitors because we saw particularly as we finished the calendar year, we saw some very aggressive pricing by some of our competitors, particularly in the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry platforms. And I don't know if you are adding to that, Jacob.\nJacob Thaysen: No. I think it's fair to say that we continue to be premium priced but there is certainly some competition in the market space right now. And yes, so there is a price pressure.\nMike McMullen: But we don't play the price game here. I mean that's not how we want to win.\nDan Leonard: Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open.\nJesse Klink: Hi. Thanks. This is Jesse, on for Patrick. First, I just wanted to touch on the China impact. I mean you guys have laid out a 1% impact to core growth from that. I just wanted to understand how that compares to your expectations of Coronavirus made at a lower than anticipated?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Maybe just to be crystal clear here. We saw roughly a 70 basis point impact in Q1. We had product that was getting ready. It was staged and getting ready to ship.\nBob McMahon: In-country.\nMike McMullen: And on the last couple of days of January and with the extension of the formal holiday, there was no one there to pick that up. So we know that was clearly an impact in Q1. In terms of Q2, what we are expecting between the first half of our year, it's roughly 1.5 to three week impact as we are ramping up. And most of that's happening in Q2. We are expecting in Q2 that the Coronavirus has roughly a one to three point impact to our growth in Q2, roughly $15 million to $40 million. In the first half, it's $25 million to $50 million. And we will expect to get that back in the second half of our fiscal year.\nJesse Klink: Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe one on the BioTek acquisition. Just wondering how that business performed relative to expectations and just kind of how the customer reception has been so far as you have broadened the portfolio offering there?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Jesse, happy to hit that right up. And relative to expectations, it's ahead of our expectations. It really has been just a tremendous addition to the company. And we are talking about this the other day inside the company. Typically, when you put together a deal scenario, it's often out of the gate, you don't see a team beating the revenue numbers all the time. And that is actually what we saw in the case of BioTek in the first full quarter as part of Agilent. And Jacob, I know you have been talking to customers and how are they thinking about BioTek being part of Agilent?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Again, I just want to underscore once again that we have been very pleased with the performance of BioTek while it's been here in Agilent. But not only BioTek, the whole cell analysis business is doing very well and are we posting double digit growth for the whole business. So we are very pleased with that and we actually believe it is going to continue for quite a long time. We see cell analysis is going to be a key driver for understanding the immune system and immune oncology. And with now the Seahorse, ACEA and BioTek and Luxcel combined, we have a very unique value proposition. And that that is really what excites us and what also is very exciting for customs is that when we combine those technologies, these techniques together, we can create more insight for the researchers and the biopharma customers that nobody else in the industry can do. So this is very exciting and we are just getting started.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi. Thanks Mike. So first question on Europe. You pointed 2% growth there. I was hoping to get a view from you on outlook and what you are baking in the guidance here? Thanks.\nMike McMullen: Thanks. Bob, why don't I just talk about our performance and you can maybe comment on the outlook. So it came in right as expected. And I think you know that Europe is in a difficult economic environment and we think our team is really doing well there relative to what's going on in the market environment. So we were actually quite pleased with how Q1 came out for us in Europe. And Bob in terms of the outlook?\nBob McMahon: Yes. So Puneet, good afternoon. As Mike said, we were pleased with the outlook of being 2% and that's kind of what we are forecasting in Q2 and the rest of the year. And so certainly the is doing a really great job of being able to deliver in a tough environment. But it kind of hit where we expected and that's kind of what we are expecting for the rest of the year as well.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. That's very helpful. So if I could touch back on China.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nPuneet Souda: I know it's been covered quite a bit. But I would really appreciate your thought there, given one of the strongest legacy positions in that country for Agilent. As the recovery happens here, are there certain segments which you think where you will see more acceleration, more faster recovery, certain product lines or certain segments where you would see a recovery faster versus others? And then I was sort of also surprised with growth you are seeing in ACG. CrossLab continues to deliver. I was trying to understand what sort of exposure you had there in China? And given the travel restrictions and everything, are you still able to ship products and service instruments seeing the growth in CrossLab here? Or how much was the impact in CrossLab, if you could quantify? Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Puneet, let me take, there is a lot into that question. So let me try to hit them. In terms of recovery, we would expect that obviously, the instrumentation portion would recover and within that probably pharma first. And so we would expect that to be prioritized over some of the other markets. In terms of ACG, we continue to be pleased by the broad-based strength there. Actually even in China, despite kind of the reduced selling days, it grew 11%. We do expect probably a slower ramp up there, less on the consumable side as the factories are getting back to production, but more on the services side, as you can imagine having our folks getting into labs right now is fairly difficult and there is a portion of that would be on demand for servicing equipment. And so we would see that probably ramp up a little slower in Q2 but then ramp back up to normal, latter half of Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. At least, that's our current assumption. As Mike mentioned, we have been in close contact with our teams in China and have been watching the order flow. And the order flow to-date is, across both ACG and LSAG as well as our DGG business which is a smaller piece, tracking to our expectations.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. And any sense in terms of the exposure that you have in China and could that mix change in the next quarter or so?\nMike McMullen: No. I don't anticipate a major shift. We have largely got a instrument heavy business in China relative to the rest of the business anyway. But our opportunity really lies in the consumables and service over time. So I don't see a dramatic change in Q2 or in the back half of the year.\nBob McMahon: Yes.\nPuneet Souda: Great. Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Very welcome, Puneet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Dan Arias from Stifel. Your line is open.\nDan Arias: Good afternoon guys. Thanks.\nMike McMullen: Hi Dan.\nDan Arias: Mike, just back to Tycho's biopharma question. Hi Mike. Next quarter, I think the comp goes way down to low singles for that customer segment. So where are you feeling like biopharma growth heads in 2Q as we just think about the momentum in the favorable comparison, but also China? Can that be more mid singles when we net out the moving parts there?\nMike McMullen: Hi Dan. I think that's a reasonable expectation. So when I was asked earlier about the pharma, we remain confident about our ability to grow in pharma. You know, part of it's going to be the pickup and continued growth that we are going to have in our NASD business. We also know that we are getting to some of the easier compares relative to the LSAG instrument business, because as you may all recall that's in the Q2 is when we starting seeing the slowdown as China went through this whole looking at their procurement practices around the generics. So we think there is a lot of good reason to be positive about the ability to have a higher growth rate in the outer quarters than we did in Q1 in our pharma business.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And we are expecting a faster growth in Q2.\nMike McMullen: Yes.\nDan Arias: Okay. And then maybe one again for you, Mike or maybe even Sam. It feels like 1Q is always a good time to ask this question, just given that most are heading down to AGBT. Any update you can give us on Lasergen product development? How much of a focus is that at this point? And then maybe what are you looking at in terms of the change in total investment there if we compare 2020 to 2019?\nMike McMullen: So I think, Sam, you are getting our bags packed, maybe at least now your team is getting their bags packed to head to that. You are staying home. That's right. Okay. Maybe just a few comments on this.\nSam Raha: Yes. Overall, thanks for the question, Dan, if you would have heard my comments already from JPMorgan, we are making progress on a number of fronts related to the development work we are doing on the Lasergen sequencer, particularly as it comes to the technical specs on our read length, on our quality and so forth. So we are continuing to make that progress. When you think about AGBT, of course, it's not just about sequencers, it's about the overall NGS workflow, it's about really looking at beyond NGS, the overall genomics. So we are excited about Magnis, which we introduced not too long ago. We are seeing, sorry to remind you, Magnis is this really walkaway automation for taking DNA libraries or actually putting DNA in and being able to come back and just load that directly onto your NGS sequencer. We have seen some really good interest in that in Europe, in America and in China. So we are going to continue sharing the message there and sharing some data from a number of customers. We also, as you would have heard us talk about, we have launched a new SureSelect XT HS2 DNA reagent kit which allows us to look at even lower starting amounts, down to 10 nanograms of DNA for FFPE which is very important for cancer. It also allows on Illumina sequencers. It's very important to be able to use molecular barcodes. We have that going on as well. And then we have a number of partnerships that we are working on with a number of customers and collaborators. So stay tuned. I think it's going to be an exciting AGBT.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And Dan, the other part of your question was --\nMike McMullen: Investment outlook.\nBob McMahon: Yes. So just quickly, our spending forecast in 2020 is the same as 2019. So we are not expecting any ramp up.\nDan Arias: Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Derek de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDerek de Bruin: Hi. Good morning or good afternoon. I have got a number of questions.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nDerek de Bruin: First one is, I guess just on the gross margin outlook for 2020. Can you sort of walk it through the next couple of quarters in terms of how that looks?\nBob McMahon: Yes. We talked about at the beginning of the year, our guide was contemplating roughly a flattish gross margin across the company and that hasn't changed. So we have always said that the first half of the year, with Q1 being the hardest of comparison because of the startup costs in NASD and you can see that kind of in our numbers. We also were affected a little less, as we mentioned before, in LSAG. We would expect that to recover as we get through the course of the year. So at a high level, Derek, I would expect our gross margins still to be within that range, roughly flat year-over-year. And where we are getting our operating leverage is really in the OpEx expense line.\nMike McMullen: And Bob, I think we are also looking to see maybe more favorable mix in our instrument business as we move forward. And I made some comments about the pricing pressure that we saw more of a calendar year end kind of phenomenon with pricing more stabilizing as we started the 2020.\nBob McMahon: Yes.\nDerek de Bruin: Well, great. That segues into my next question on instruments. And so I think you had said last quarter, you were expecting may be flattish instruments for the full year. Is that still sort of your expectation? And that leads into, any idea of sort of what pent-up demand could be? I mean do you sense from customers, particularly in C&E, if there's people waiting on the sidelines to buy when the budget gets better? I am just trying to get a sense of what the instrument dynamic looks like.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hi Derek. This Bob. I think the short answer on your first question is, yes. We are still in that range of roughly flat. Actually if you looked at Q1, we were down 2% core, but if you adjust it for the Coronavirus, it would been down about 1% on the most difficult comp that we had. To your point around C&E, there have been chutes of life and some of our customers looking at things. Now what I would say is the Coronavirus kind of froze some of that into question. But I would say, that's still intact right now. I don't know. Jacob, if you have anything?\nJacob Thaysen: No. Overall, I do think that there is some pushed out pent-up demand here. And eventually, there will be a tech refresh. And we have invested over the past period quite a lot into our instrument portfolio and really refreshed across the whole portfolio. So when that pent-up demand is coming forward, we are ready. But we just can't call it right now exactly when that's going to happen.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Jacob, I will just add one thing. Early on in my tenure, we had a similar kind of slowdown in the C&E. The difference here is that, at that time, a lot of our platforms were rather aged. This time, we have a completely refreshed platform. So it also is a great productivity message there to customers. And our lab managers also have the ability to go to their management and say, listen, there is something new out there. I am not buying this, I am replacing like-for-like.\nDerek de Bruin: Great. And then just one, maybe I missed something, but you did 3.7% contribution from M&A in the first quarter, 3.5% to 3.7% in the second quarter and then the guide for the full year is 2.85 to 2.9%. Is it something else in the first half besides BioTek? And if not, why are you expecting a step down?\nBob McMahon: So you have get very good math and we are not expecting a step down. The only thing that's in the numbers and that could be an area of potential opportunity.\nDerek de Bruin: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nMike McMullen: Hi Brandon.\nBrandon Couillard: Mike, just on a separate topic.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nBrandon Couillard: Can you sort of speak to the Twist settlement last week? Why only $25 million? And should we expect any legal savings from having that case out of the way now to reinvest those dollars?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So first of all, just a few comments on the settlement. So we are very pleased with the agreement that was reached with Twist. As you know, we think it's in the best interest of our shareholders to rigorously protect our IP. And not only in addition to receiving a payment from Twist, they also had to procure a license from us for certain aspects of our oligo synthesis technology. And we are really a company that's committed to doing innovation in the right way. So we are really pleased with how the settlement goes. And Bob relative to the treatment of the legal expenses and outlook for the rest of the year? I think we have that in pro forma, right?\nBob McMahon: Yes. We will pro forma that.\nMike McMullen: Yes. So you will see both the settlement come in, Brandon, as well as the costs associated with that, I guess, in our Q2 results.\nBob McMahon: That's right.\nBrandon Couillard: Thanks. And maybe one more higher-level question for you, Mike.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nBrandon Couillard: I mean you mentioned sustainability, that recognition. Clearly, that's becoming a much bigger focus I think for the investment community. Can you just help us contextualize that focus may help contribute to your growth or cash flow or differentiate you in terms of the customer base?\nMike McMullen: Yes. It's a great question. So as I mentioned in my call script, we have been doing these things because we thought it was the right thing to do and now people are really paying attention to it. So I think it helps on multiple aspects of the business. So first of all, relative to our new products which have a very favorable environmental impact, there is real compelling reason for customers because a lot of our most important customers have their own sustainability initiatives and they are very interested. I have several European customers I am visiting next month and they want to hear about our sustainability plans. So when you talk to them about how we are reducing the footprint, the electrical consumption, that some of our products don't even use gases and that we have eliminated the use of gases and gas chromatography in the case the NPIs and we are reducing the size of the packaging. And by the way, that also comes with the benefit to Agilent's P&L. So it really helps in terms of our customer relationships and our ability to drive sales into those accounts. And also it is really quite helpful for recruiting of new employees into the company. New employees when they are looking at potentially joining the company really want to know what Agilent stands for when we talk to them about our culture and what we do as a company in the local community, what we do for the environment, our views on diversity and inclusion. I think it really is a powerful message to attract new employees to Agilent, but also for those who are part of the Agilent team to really be proud of the company they work for and be energized about where the company is going forward. I think we have talked before, I am a big fan of sports and if you build a great team, you get great things happen in the marketplace or on the field. And I think that really is really one of the major benefits you get here which is what it does for your team. So it really is a multitude of impact for the customers, I mean for the company and something we really believe in.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in.\nMike McMullen: Hi Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: One, maybe on China, Mike. We have heard some chatter of possibly the government initiating some sort of stimulus here to kick-start the economy. If that were to be the case, where would that impact fall? Is that in C&E and food? Is that where we would see your China numbers coming up?\nMike McMullen: Well, I have to say I have heard some rumblings of stimulus, but I haven't seen anything around the specifics of what a stimulus would be. I don't know Bob or whether you have anything to add.\nBob McMahon: No. I think you are getting --\nMike McMullen: That's a likely area.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Exactly, I think that's a likely area. That and pharma.\nMike McMullen: And also, I would also expect environmental as well. So that would be my guess, because these are major quality of life initiatives that the Chinese government has been behind. So my guess is that's where they would put the stimulus. But again, we don't have any specifics. That would just be pure speculation on my part at this point in time.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And Bob, a quick one on the EPS guidance here. I see that the tax rate ticked down sequentially on the guidance front. Did anything change on the margins at all because it looks like the revenue range remains unchanged? So I am wondering if this is below the line or margins some sort of impact here?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Nothing material, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: All right. Thanks guys.\nMike McMullen: You are welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteve Beuchaw: Hi and thanks for the time everybody.\nMike McMullen: Sure, Steve.\nSteve Beuchaw: I guess first I wanted to start with Bob with just a question about one of the underpinnings of the outlook for the year that hasn't been touched on so much just yet and it's NASD, maybe a two-parter on NASD. One is, do you think we feel good about getting to a few dozen millions of dollars of contribution from NASD? And then can you give us any perspective and I guess maybe this is a Sam question, as to how much of the capacity on the new facility in Fredrick is now contracted? And then I have one for Mike.\nBob McMahon: Sure. Yes. Let me make sure I answer your question correctly. What I would say is, Q1 came in slightly better than what we expected on the ramp. So we feel very good about that trajectory. Obviously, you know the second half of the year is going to be significantly greater than the first half of the year as we ramp up that business. And I would say that the order book, we feel very good about.\nSam Raha: Yes. And maybe Steve, to build on what Bob said. We have said that there is a ramp rate that we have been planning all along. That's what we are seeing. So as you really get into Q4, we will be much more in the run rate, if you will, of what to expect going into financial year 2021 in terms of the Frederick site in particular. So it's ramping as planned. It is being utilized. We were happy to produce good product and good revenue from that in this quarter again after starting last quarter. And further to what Bob said, a lot of these programs and projects are long lead, both working with our customers to really lay the groundwork and do the work. So though I can't tell you exactly what percentage, I do feel good about the percentage of programs and projects that we are already lining up going into next year.\nMike McMullen: And Steve, if I could just amplify one of the points that Sam made. It was absolutely crucial that those first batches we produce for customers met their expectations. And as you know, we are very cautious in terms of how we started positioning the ramp here because we just had to get it right and we have gotten it right for those first few customers. I think that really positions us well when we look at the outlook for the rest of the year.\nSteve Beuchaw: Okay. That makes a ton of sense. Thank you for all the color there. And then Mike, I wonder if we could just do the zoom-out thing, if you will, where we think about the full year. I mean there are so many moving parts, right. And the Coronavirus certainly makes it more complicated. But if I rewind to 90 days ago or so, there was a perspective, not necessarily from Agilent, but certainly in investor conversations that the outlook for fiscal 2020 was really conservative or significantly conservative. And I think we have, of course, heard from you guys over the years, outlook that started at one point and you pretty consistently do better than the outlook. I wonder if you could just give us your perspective on the outlook and guidance philosophy now that you know 90 days more than you did at the time you gave the outlook at the beginning of the year, to what extent is this middle of the fairway, to what extent is this conservative? And as you talk to your customers and you think about the outlook, I mean, how are you feeling and how has that evolved, just again really zooming out? Thanks so much.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Steve, so I am in the conference room zooming out right now and great question. And I think that that's how we thought about the full year guide, which I will leave it to you to prescribe the first adjective. I mean there were proper adjectives, but we started this year with a guide that we thought was relatively the floor of what we could do and talked about areas of potential upside for the business. And we were actually tracking well in the first quarter where it would have been a beat, both on the revenue and EPS side of the quarter, albeit the impact of the much talked about today the impact of the Coronavirus. So that's why we felt pretty confident about our ability to say, listen, there are still a lot of puts and takes relative to China in the near term, but there are other aspects of the business are doing extremely well outside of China, whether it be NASD or ACG business. The compares and the strength of our LASG instrument portfolio, that's gone on NGS. So we have a lot and then back to cell analysis. So we have a lot of confidence and whether we call it a middle of fairway right now, but we feel pretty good about --\nBob McMahon: Yes. I would say, Steve, one thing. Obviously 90 days ago, we didn't have the epidemic that we are seeing right now which is unprecedented. And so what we are trying to do is we are seeing, hey, in the first half of the year, we are expecting a $25 million to $50 million impact that we are going to make up in the second half of the year. Now the question is, how fast. And we hope for everyone's sake that that will ramp up fast and we will get this behind us. But that's certainly puts a lot more variability in our forecast. We feel good about where our forecast is. But we certainly didn't anticipate that at the beginning of the year.\nSteve Beuchaw: Okay. I really appreciate the color there. Thanks for bearing with me. I appreciate it.\nMike McMullen: Sure, Steve. Great question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBill Quirk: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everybody.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon Bill.\nBob McMahon: Hi Bill.\nBill Quirk: So I guess Bob or Mike, just update on M&A. You had mentioned on the last call that you would be considering looking at larger deals in and around $1 billion. Just curious what the update is?\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think the statement I made in last quarterly call remains which is, we think that deploying our capital towards growth and earnings drivers on the M&A front makes a lot of sense for our shareholders in deals that makes sense for us, in markets that we know where we can really leverage the scale of the company. And we did our largest deal, BioTek, the past quarter. And as you heard earlier, that's off to a really good start. I think we often get the question, well, how large you are willing to go? And the way, Bob and I have described it is, listen, we could go maybe multiples of that. But we are looking to stay in our lane here and not do anything that's magnitude larger than a BioTek. So I am not saying that BioTek is the max level. But probably multiples of that as opposed to something that's of a magnitude size.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And Bill, as you can appreciate, timing there is always very difficult to understand and we are going to remain disciplined. And if there isn't anything out there that would meet our financial criteria, we are not going to do it. We don't need to do M&A to make our model work. But certainly, you see in the first quarter the benefit that we have seen with BioTek and really building scale in cell analysis, which we think has a long term growth opportunity for us, not only in LSAG but across the business.\nBill Quirk: Understood. And then just secondly, I guess kind of a bigger picture question about the pacing of CrossLab. Over the course of the year, we are going to be heading into slightly more difficult comps for the next couple of quarters?\nBob McMahon: Yes. The beauty of ACG has been it's predictability across the business and we are not expecting any dramatic change in the back half of the year with the possible exception of slightly an elevated ramp in China. But that business that Mark and team have built has been just phenomenal in terms of providing stable high growth and profitable growth over the course of the last several years. And I think that that, quite honestly, is a great legacy to what Mark has been able to accomplish. And not only that, it really speaks to what our customers are looking for in terms of productivity in the labs and so forth. So we would expect that to continue to kind of chug along as we have talked about in the past.\nBill Quirk: Got it. Thank you very much.\nMike McMullen: You are welcome.\nAnkur Dhingra: All right. Thanks everyone. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "No. Mike, you hit the nail the head. The business is performing as we have expected. We continue to see interest in all the customers, the pharma customers that we have given tours to. We are doing work now there for a number of customers. Not to be boring, nothing new to report. It is progressing as per plan. Yes. That's right, Mike. We continue to have good growth, you know, with market, above market with our overall NGS portfolio. So we feel good about that. And the low double digits, our pathology business, as you heard on Mike's opening comments and Bob's as well, we believe we will continue to gain share there growing in the mid single digits. And you just heard about NASD. So you look at the major parts of DGG, we had I think a really well-balanced good quarter. Yes. Overall, thanks for the question, Dan, if you would have heard my comments already from JPMorgan, we are making progress on a number of fronts related to the development work we are doing on the Lasergen sequencer, particularly as it comes to the technical specs on our read length, on our quality and so forth.

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks Ankur and thanks everyone, for joining us on our call today. I would like to start today's call with a reminder that Mark Doak, ACG Group President, will be retiring on May 1. While Mark and his wife are currently enjoying a long planned location and is not able join us today, I would be remiss in not taking the opportunity to recognize the outstanding accomplishments Mark has made in his stellar 38-year. His track record of results speak for itself. Thank you, Mark. We have a very strong bench at Agilent and have already named Mark's successor, Padraig McDonnell. Padraig knows the business well. He has been on Mark's staff for several years and is currently running out chemistries and supplies division. Padraig and Mark are already working on transition activities as Padraig prepares to take the helm of the ACG business at the start of fiscal Q3. Our congratulations to both Mark and Padraig. And now on to the quarterly results. The Agilent team delivered a strong start to 2020. Q1 revenues are above our expectations as business grew in all regions and markets. Total revenues of $1.36 billion are up 5.7% year-over-year on a reported basis and 2.4% on a core basis. We continue to translate our topline growth into strong bottomline earnings. Our EPS of $0.81 is up 7% and is at the high-end of our guidance. Before going into business units and market details of our quarterly results, I want to speak about two specific areas that highlight how our building and buying strategy of investing in fast-growing markets continues to deliver growth and help us create a more resilient business. First, I want to talk about our most recent acquisition, BioTek. This was the first quarter with the BioTek team onboard and the business is off to a very strong start with revenue growth above our expectations. We continue to be very enthusiastic about the cell analysis space and BioTek continues the strong momentum that originally got us interested in bring them into Agilent. The BioTek leadership team was just in Santa Clara for a few days of planned meetings and they are very energized and excited about the future possibilities to make it a great business even stronger as part of the Agilent. Second, the resiliency of our business model is on full display this quarter as Agilent delivered strong growth and earnings in the face of a negative Q1 impact from the Coronavirus outbreak in China. As this has dominated headlines, let me add a few additional comments regarding the Coronavirus and its impact on Agilent. Most importantly, our thoughts go out to all those affected by the Coronavirus. On the Agilent front, our team fortunately has not had any direct health impact and many returned to work last week. We are remotely supporting our customers as a number of them gradually resume operations. We have also restarted our in-country production activities and they are shipping products to customers within China and internationally, albeit at a reduced rate. On the business side, given that our first quarter ended January 31, we are seeing business impact across both fiscal quarters, Q1 and Q2. In Q1, our revenues are running ahead of expectations right up to Lunar New Year Holiday. However, the extensive Lunar New Year Holiday affects our customers' ability to transact and accept shipments during the last days of the quarter. This reduced our reported revenue by approximately $10 million in total for the quarter, primarily in our LSAG instrument business. We have since recognized the bulk of this revenue now in Q2. Looking ahead, we are projecting that Coronavirus will continue to impact our China business throughout Q2. Bob will share additional details, but we are anticipating delays in new equipment purchases and a slower uptake of consumables and services. The slower uptake is due to reduced number of selling days resulting from the extension of Lunar New Year, along with customer and logistics operations that are ramping, but not yet fully operational. It's important to note, while we are forecasting the impact to our Q2 business, our full year outlook for total Agilent revenues and EPS remains unchanged. Our business outside of China remains on a solid footing and we believe a large portion of our China business that is currently being impacted by the Coronavirus is not lost but rather is delayed. As you know, the Coronavirus outbreak is unfortunately impacting the health and safety of tens of thousands of people. I am very proud of how the Agilent team has responded to do our part to help. Our Agilent China team is now actually supporting those customers during crucial research into the virus. We have donated instruments and supplies to four clinical and research institutions based in China to support these research and drug development efforts. We continue to closely monitor events in China and are prepared to act quickly to help wherever possible. Now on to additional details of our quarterly results. Agilent's growth is broad-based as our business grew across all regions and end markets. Regional performance was led by the Americas posting 5% core growth with America coming in with low single digit results and Asia holding steady. Despite the timing of the Lunar New Year and the Coronavirus impact late in the quarter, our China business grew low single digits. While all end markets grew, our results were led by strong growth in the biopharma and environmental forensics markets. Now taking a closer look at how the individual business units performed. LSAG revenues grew 5% on a reported basis driven my strong performance in our biopharma and cell analysis business. On a core basis, LSAG's revenues were down 2% against a tough compare and inclusive of the unexpected Q1 impact from the Coronavirus. With the exception of China, all regions and end markets performed in line with expectations. The ACG business continues to deliver strong results, posting 7% core growth even with reduced selling days in China. This growth was broad-based across all major market segments and regions. These results continue to demonstrate the strength of our ACG CrossLab strategy and how we are leading the transformation of the analytical lab. DGG has also posted 7% growth in the quarter against a difficult 12% growth compare. We have experienced a continuation of positive trends winning share on our core pathology business and seeing strength our NGS QA/QC franchise. We continue to be pleased with the revenue ramp at our new oligo manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado. In addition to driving strong finance results, I want to highlight some other notable events that took place during the quarter. We continue to bring different and new product to the market, meaning strong customer and external recognition. We just introduced the Agilent SureSelect XT HS2 DNA kit. This, along with our recently launched automated sample prep platform, Magnis, further strengthens our leadership position in the NGS sample prep market. In addition, two industry publication honored the Agilent InfinityLab LC/MSD iQ system with 2019 innovation awards. The award-winning mass spectrometer introduced last June incorporates intelligent design and innovations such as embedded sensors that monitor instrument health. And finally, earlier this month, Barron's name Agilent number one in the list of the 2019 Most Sustainable Companies in America. We are very proud of this recognition. Sustainability is a critical topic that is gaining increased interest from customers, employees and investors. More importantly, we believe focusing on sustainability is simply the right thing to do. Before I pass the call on to Bob, I would like to close with a reminder of Agilent's resilience and our shareholder value creation model, delivering above market growth, expanding operating margins and a balanced deployment of capital. We are able to thrive by focusing on platforms with multiple large end markets and long term growth opportunities. We are also driving growth in the aftermarket, increasing our focus on faster growing end markets, streamlining our infrastructure and operations and investing in the future of Agilent, both organically and inorganically. We do all this while maintaining acute focus on delivering EPS growth with superior quality of earnings and driving shareholder value creation. Despite the temporary business uncertainty created by the Coronavirus in China, I remain confident about the longer term growth prospects of the China market, our China growth strategy and most importantly our team. I am very proud and confident in the strength and resiliency of our China team and their ability to overcome any near term challenges that come our way. When I look at our global team in our business, our growth prospects and team have never been stronger. We are laser focused on driving revenue and earnings growth. I am pleased to tell you that all these facts allow us to maintain our growth and earnings outlook for the year. Thank you for being on the call and I look forward to answering your questions. I will now hand off the call to Bob. Bob? Sure, Tycho. I think I will handle both questions. And Bob, correct me if I go off script here. But I think we still think that the mid single digit number is doable for the year in China. What we are seeing already on ground from our team, I was just on the phone today with our team in China, we are still able to transact and orders are actually coming in as forecast. I think that we think a lot of the procurement is going to occur a little bit later in the year. We think a lot of it's recoverable with the exception of probably some aspects of our service business where customers really are looking for service people to arrive on the sites. I think we feel pretty good about how we are thinking about China throughout the rest of the year, albeit it being a very fluid situation. And you know, we really haven't seen any kind of transitory or connected impact on C&E. In fact, C&E actually did better than we were thinking in the first quarter. It's too early to call it a trend but some of the PMIs are actually inching up which would maybe give an indication of perhaps a better outlook and some initial noise in some of our major accounts about thinking on procurement. But we still remain cautious in terms of the outlook for C&E but I am f encouraged by the Q1 results. And again, we are not really seeing significant movements around in that area on a global basis. And we think back to the first comment on China, we weren't expecting a lot in C&E this year in China anyway. So I think we are in pretty solid shape relative to the outlook there as well. You know, I think the big story there is China, right. Yes. And then within the pharma numbers, Tycho, the biopharma segment really was strong for us again this quarter as well. And then we think as the 4+7 initiative rolls out in the latter part of this year, then we will see the growth in the small molecule side of that space. And then, we have really strong growth in NASD and the ACG business is strong in pharma. So we are feeling pretty good about pharma. Thank you Tycho. Hi Doug. How are you, Ryan? Yes. Sure, Ryan. Thanks for that question. So as I touched briefly on my call script, we actually have resumed production and are in a really solid position now to not only ship the product to our customers in China, but also products that are manufactured in China to have them exported into the global market environment. And as we have a very diversified global footprint in terms of supply chain and manufacturing capabilities, we think the near term, we are in pretty solid shape relative to ability to meet our commitments from a he shipment perspective. And then you also may recall that starting with the initiation of the U.S. based tariffs, we actually had initiated a movement of a lot of our supply chain out of China. So it actually has mitigated our risk here as well. You want to take this, Bob. Good afternoon Jack. So as I imagine, you maybe getting a little tired of hearing this from Bob and myself. I am going to pull Sam into this conversation. But as we highlighted in the call script, the NASD business continues to ramp as we would expect. We are really pleased with the progress and how we are starting to fill out that factory. Still not yet at full capacity, operating at full capacity yet but it was a contributor to our growth in the first quarter, no doubt. And Sam, anything else you would like to add there? So all good news right now. Yes. And Bob, I think I will just make this one more point too, while we look at the second half outlook for the business, it's not all about China recovery. The other elements of the business, including NASD, which we know we are going to have a strong second half. I think it was really -- this is Mike, Jack and Sam feel free to jump in on this. We had 12% growth last year, so tough compares. We had solid growth across all elements of that business. And outside of again may be a China impact for an element of the business, things are firing on all cylinders also across the businesses is how I recall. It mainly is a comparison story. No problem. Yes. I know, Jacob you were looking into this. And I would add that you know, it ended where we expected it to be. Hi Dan, I just can't help but to jump in on this one. And I think that question should be posed to our competitors because we saw particularly as we finished the calendar year, we saw some very aggressive pricing by some of our competitors, particularly in the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry platforms. And I don't know if you are adding to that, Jacob. But we don't play the price game here. I mean that's not how we want to win. Yes. Maybe just to be crystal clear here. We saw roughly a 70 basis point impact in Q1. We had product that was getting ready. It was staged and getting ready to ship. And on the last couple of days of January and with the extension of the formal holiday, there was no one there to pick that up. So we know that was clearly an impact in Q1. In terms of Q2, what we are expecting between the first half of our year, it's roughly 1.5 to three week impact as we are ramping up. And most of that's happening in Q2. We are expecting in Q2 that the Coronavirus has roughly a one to three point impact to our growth in Q2, roughly $15 million to $40 million. In the first half, it's $25 million to $50 million. And we will expect to get that back in the second half of our fiscal year. Yes. Jesse, happy to hit that right up. And relative to expectations, it's ahead of our expectations. It really has been just a tremendous addition to the company. And we are talking about this the other day inside the company. Typically, when you put together a deal scenario, it's often out of the gate, you don't see a team beating the revenue numbers all the time. And that is actually what we saw in the case of BioTek in the first full quarter as part of Agilent. And Jacob, I know you have been talking to customers and how are they thinking about BioTek being part of Agilent? Thanks. Bob, why don't I just talk about our performance and you can maybe comment on the outlook. So it came in right as expected. And I think you know that Europe is in a difficult economic environment and we think our team is really doing well there relative to what's going on in the market environment. So we were actually quite pleased with how Q1 came out for us in Europe. And Bob in terms of the outlook? Sure. No. I don't anticipate a major shift. We have largely got a instrument heavy business in China relative to the rest of the business anyway. But our opportunity really lies in the consumables and service over time. So I don't see a dramatic change in Q2 or in the back half of the year. Very welcome, Puneet. Hi Dan. Hi Dan. I think that's a reasonable expectation. So when I was asked earlier about the pharma, we remain confident about our ability to grow in pharma. You know, part of it's going to be the pickup and continued growth that we are going to have in our NASD business. We also know that we are getting to some of the easier compares relative to the LSAG instrument business, because as you may all recall that's in the Q2 is when we starting seeing the slowdown as China went through this whole looking at their procurement practices around the generics. So we think there is a lot of good reason to be positive about the ability to have a higher growth rate in the outer quarters than we did in Q1 in our pharma business. Yes. So I think, Sam, you are getting our bags packed, maybe at least now your team is getting their bags packed to head to that. You are staying home. That's right. Okay. Maybe just a few comments on this. Investment outlook. Sure. And Bob, I think we are also looking to see maybe more favorable mix in our instrument business as we move forward. And I made some comments about the pricing pressure that we saw more of a calendar year end kind of phenomenon with pricing more stabilizing as we started the 2020. Yes. Jacob, I will just add one thing. Early on in my tenure, we had a similar kind of slowdown in the C&E. The difference here is that, at that time, a lot of our platforms were rather aged. This time, we have a completely refreshed platform. So it also is a great productivity message there to customers. And our lab managers also have the ability to go to their management and say, listen, there is something new out there. I am not buying this, I am replacing like-for-like. Hi Brandon. Sure. Yes. So first of all, just a few comments on the settlement. So we are very pleased with the agreement that was reached with Twist. As you know, we think it's in the best interest of our shareholders to rigorously protect our IP. And not only in addition to receiving a payment from Twist, they also had to procure a license from us for certain aspects of our oligo synthesis technology. And we are really a company that's committed to doing innovation in the right way. So we are really pleased with how the settlement goes. And Bob relative to the treatment of the legal expenses and outlook for the rest of the year? I think we have that in pro forma, right? Yes. So you will see both the settlement come in, Brandon, as well as the costs associated with that, I guess, in our Q2 results. Sure. Yes. It's a great question. So as I mentioned in my call script, we have been doing these things because we thought it was the right thing to do and now people are really paying attention to it. So I think it helps on multiple aspects of the business. So first of all, relative to our new products which have a very favorable environmental impact, there is real compelling reason for customers because a lot of our most important customers have their own sustainability initiatives and they are very interested. I have several European customers I am visiting next month and they want to hear about our sustainability plans. So when you talk to them about how we are reducing the footprint, the electrical consumption, that some of our products don't even use gases and that we have eliminated the use of gases and gas chromatography in the case the NPIs and we are reducing the size of the packaging. And by the way, that also comes with the benefit to Agilent's P&L. So it really helps in terms of our customer relationships and our ability to drive sales into those accounts. And also it is really quite helpful for recruiting of new employees into the company. New employees when they are looking at potentially joining the company really want to know what Agilent stands for when we talk to them about our culture and what we do as a company in the local community, what we do for the environment, our views on diversity and inclusion. I think it really is a powerful message to attract new employees to Agilent, but also for those who are part of the Agilent team to really be proud of the company they work for and be energized about where the company is going forward. I think we have talked before, I am a big fan of sports and if you build a great team, you get great things happen in the marketplace or on the field. And I think that really is really one of the major benefits you get here which is what it does for your team. So it really is a multitude of impact for the customers, I mean for the company and something we really believe in. Hi Vijay. Well, I have to say I have heard some rumblings of stimulus, but I haven't seen anything around the specifics of what a stimulus would be. I don't know Bob or whether you have anything to add. That's a likely area. And also, I would also expect environmental as well. So that would be my guess, because these are major quality of life initiatives that the Chinese government has been behind. So my guess is that's where they would put the stimulus. But again, we don't have any specifics. That would just be pure speculation on my part at this point in time. You are welcome. Sure, Steve. And Steve, if I could just amplify one of the points that Sam made. It was absolutely crucial that those first batches we produce for customers met their expectations. And as you know, we are very cautious in terms of how we started positioning the ramp here because we just had to get it right and we have gotten it right for those first few customers. I think that really positions us well when we look at the outlook for the rest of the year. Yes. Steve, so I am in the conference room zooming out right now and great question. And I think that that's how we thought about the full year guide, which I will leave it to you to prescribe the first adjective. I mean there were proper adjectives, but we started this year with a guide that we thought was relatively the floor of what we could do and talked about areas of potential upside for the business. And we were actually tracking well in the first quarter where it would have been a beat, both on the revenue and EPS side of the quarter, albeit the impact of the much talked about today the impact of the Coronavirus. So that's why we felt pretty confident about our ability to say, listen, there are still a lot of puts and takes relative to China in the near term, but there are other aspects of the business are doing extremely well outside of China, whether it be NASD or ACG business. The compares and the strength of our LASG instrument portfolio, that's gone on NGS. So we have a lot and then back to cell analysis. So we have a lot of confidence and whether we call it a middle of fairway right now, but we feel pretty good about -- Sure, Steve. Great question. Good afternoon Bill. Yes. I think the statement I made in last quarterly call remains which is, we think that deploying our capital towards growth and earnings drivers on the M&A front makes a lot of sense for our shareholders in deals that makes sense for us, in markets that we know where we can really leverage the scale of the company. And we did our largest deal, BioTek, the past quarter. And as you heard earlier, that's off to a really good start. I think we often get the question, well, how large you are willing to go? And the way, Bob and I have described it is, listen, we could go maybe multiples of that. But we are looking to stay in our lane here and not do anything that's magnitude larger than a BioTek. So I am not saying that BioTek is the max level. But probably multiples of that as opposed to something that's of a magnitude size. You are welcome."

            "name": "Jacob Thaysen",
            "content": "Yes. And I think the continued depressed PMI certainly impacts C&E business, chemical and energy business. So we continue to see that in U.S. being performing at least flat and we would like to see improvement. But I think it's going to still take some time for that to happen. Yes, sure. No. I think it's fair to say that we continue to be premium priced but there is certainly some competition in the market space right now. And yes, so there is a price pressure. Yes. Again, I just want to underscore once again that we have been very pleased with the performance of BioTek while it's been here in Agilent. But not only BioTek, the whole cell analysis business is doing very well and are we posting double digit growth for the whole business. So we are very pleased with that and we actually believe it is going to continue for quite a long time. We see cell analysis is going to be a key driver for understanding the immune system and immune oncology. And with now the Seahorse, ACEA and BioTek and Luxcel combined, we have a very unique value proposition. And that that is really what excites us and what also is very exciting for customs is that when we combine those technologies, these techniques together, we can create more insight for the researchers and the biopharma customers that nobody else in the industry can do. So this is very exciting and we are just getting started. No. Overall, I do think that there is some pushed out pent-up demand here. And eventually, there will be a tech refresh. And we have invested over the past period quite a lot into our instrument portfolio and really refreshed across the whole portfolio. So when that pent-up demand is coming forward, we are ready. But we just can't call it right now exactly when that's going to happen."

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thank you Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional detail on revenue, walk through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics and then finish up with our updated guidance for Q2 and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Our first quarter results were very good as we had strong execution across all regions and markets. Revenue for the quarter was $1.36 billion with reported revenue growth of 5.7%. Currency negatively impacted revenue by 0.4 percentage points and acquisitions added 3.7 percentage points to growth. Our core growth was 2.4% in the quarter. As Mike indicated, our performance was impacted by the extension of the Lunar New Year Holiday due to the Coronavirus. This reduced the number of shipping days in China and we estimate it shifted $10 million in revenue out of Q1. If not for the reduced shipping days in Q1, our performance would have been stronger with the shift affecting our core revenue growth by roughly 70 basis points. In terms of end markets, we saw growth across all of our six end market segments. Pharma, environmental and forensics and diagnostics and clinical led the way for us in the first quarter. During the quarter, pharma grew 3%, double digit growth in DGG and high single digit growth in ACG, offset a mid single digit decline for LSAG. Within pharma, our biopharma or large molecule segment grew high single digits. And on a geographic basis, our pharma business experienced high single-digit growth in the Americas and mid single digit growth in Europe. This was partially offset by mid single digit decline in China, largely associated with the timing of the Lunar New Year and to a lesser extent the execution of the 4+7 program. The 4+7 program is playing out as we expected with the third round completed in January and multiple winners per drug. We continue to believe that this is a long-term positive for the industry as drug quality improves and access to healthcare increases. Our environmental and forensics business grew 4% against a very tough compare last year of 10%. During the quarter, we saw balanced growth between instruments and aftermarket sales. And diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 3% against a strong 11% compare last year. Mid single digit growth in DGG, driven by continued share gains in our pathology business, were partially offset by declines in LSAG and ACG with both only having small businesses in this segment. Chemical and energy revenue grew 2%. Services and consumables grew mid single digits offset by flat instrument sales. Academia and government grew 1% with services and consumables growing mid single digits, partially offset by flat instrument sales. Mid single digit growth in the Americas was partially offset by flat to low single digit declines in the other regions. And finally, food returned a modest growth, up 1%. Low teens growth in services and consumables was partially offset by declines in instrumentation. While one quarter does not make a trend, we are pleased with the continual progress in this market. On a geographic basis, we saw growth in all regions, led by Americas growing mid single digits. Europe grew 2%, in line with our expectations. And as Mike mentioned, our business in China was running ahead of expectations through the first two months of fiscal 2020. As mentioned earlier, despite the shift of the $10 million, China still grew 1%. If not for the extension of the Lunar New Year, our core growth in China would have been solidly mid single digits. Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 55.7%, down 120 basis points versus the prior year. This is a result of the planned startup costs for our new NASD facility as well as product mix and some negative pricing effects on our instrumentation business. We offset 90 basis points as we leveraged our cost basis in operating expenses. And as a result, our operating margin was 22.9%, down slightly from 23.1% in the first quarter of last year. Adjusting for the $10 million Coronavirus impact on revenue, operating margins would have increased versus the prior year and so we feel good about our continued opportunity to expand operating margins. We were also able to lower our tax rate slightly to 15.5% and expect that rate to continue for the rest of the year. This resulted a non-GAAP EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.81, at the top end of our guidance and representing 7% growth. Before turning to second quarter guidance, I want to touch on a few other financial metrics. Our operating cash flow was an outflow of $59 million, in line with expectations as we incurred the one-time tax outflow of $226 million related to the transfer of intangibles as noted last quarter. We also paid out $56 million in dividends and purchased 726,000 shares for $60 million. We ended the quarter in a net debt position and a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times. Now let's turn to our non-GAAP financial guidance for Q2. We are anticipating revenues in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion in the second quarter. This range is larger than we have traditionally provided as we have been tempted to estimate an impact of the Coronavirus on our business in the second quarter. As this is a fluid situation, we thought it would be helpful to detail all our assumptions, particularly as we have seen impact across both Q1 and Q2. Our guidance contemplates a $25 million to $50 million impact in our first half of our fiscal year, which translates to roughly to a 1.5 to three week impact on China revenues. Of this, we saw $10 million in Q1 and we are estimating a net $15 million to $40 million incremental impact in Q2. The Q2 revenue range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion translates into reported growth of 3.4% to 6.6% with core growth of 1% to 4%. Currency is expected to have a negative 1.1% impact while M&A is expected to contribute 3.5% to 3.7% in the quarter. We are estimating the Coronavirus to negatively impact our Q2 core growth by one to three points. Our revenue outlook translates Q2 earnings in the range of $0.72 to $0.76 per share, 1.4% to 7% growth versus last year. Importantly, as Mike mentioned, we believe the majority of this business is not lost, rather delayed as customers and the government ramp and recover. In addition, our business outside of China remains strong. As such, we expect a larger second half of the year and are not changing our full year guidance for revenue or EPS. So before starting up the call for questions, I want to conclude by saying we have a very solid start to the year that shows the strength and breadth of our portfolio. It is that portfolio, coupled with the strength of the Agilent team that, despite the uncertainty caused by the Coronavirus, we are maintaining our full year outlook. With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A. Yes. That's exactly right, Mike. There's two elements there. One is the shifting of the Lunar New Year from Q2 into Q1 as well as the extension of the Lunar New Year Holiday. So those are the two primary pieces. Yes. Ryan, this is Bob. Just to follow-up, we have twice weekly calls with our team in China, inclusive of logistics as well as our supply chain. And obviously, it's quite dynamic but as it currently stands today, we feel like we have the ability to be able to procure not only raw materials but also produce the finished goods and ship not only within China but also get product into China and vice versa. Yes. So on food, as I mentioned, we certainly are pleased with the progress we have had several quarters of kind of very predictable performance there. And actually Q1, despite the Coronavirus, it probably had more impact on the pharma side then in food. It grew 1% on a global basis. It was down slightly in China, but certainly not to the level that it had been in the past. So we feel good about that. It's probably too early to call that it's going to return to growth. Long term, we do believe it will return to growth, but not ready to call that in this fiscal year. In terms of the timing of the Coronavirus, that $10 million, that was quite a large incremental because we had all the costs. So that was probably a higher than normal kind of incremental drop to the bottomline. And that was probably a little over $0.01 of impact on the full quarter. Yes. I would just add, Jack. You know, as we have talked about, this will ramp up and be a more material impact in the second half of the year. It's progressing as we expected it. It had a slight impact to the DGG and a slight impact to the overall Agilent organic core growth and we are very pleased with the progress. That's right. Yes. Hi. Dan. Welcome back and appreciate the question. It was really a combination of a very tough compare. I would say probably the area that was a little softer was the instrumentation business. They had the most difficult compare in the first quarter and we would expect that to improve in Q2 through Q4 as we get to easier compares. In-country. Yes. So Puneet, good afternoon. As Mike said, we were pleased with the outlook of being 2% and that's kind of what we are forecasting in Q2 and the rest of the year. And so certainly the is doing a really great job of being able to deliver in a tough environment. But it kind of hit where we expected and that's kind of what we are expecting for the rest of the year as well. Puneet, let me take, there is a lot into that question. So let me try to hit them. In terms of recovery, we would expect that obviously, the instrumentation portion would recover and within that probably pharma first. And so we would expect that to be prioritized over some of the other markets. In terms of ACG, we continue to be pleased by the broad-based strength there. Actually even in China, despite kind of the reduced selling days, it grew 11%. We do expect probably a slower ramp up there, less on the consumable side as the factories are getting back to production, but more on the services side, as you can imagine having our folks getting into labs right now is fairly difficult and there is a portion of that would be on demand for servicing equipment. And so we would see that probably ramp up a little slower in Q2 but then ramp back up to normal, latter half of Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. At least, that's our current assumption. As Mike mentioned, we have been in close contact with our teams in China and have been watching the order flow. And the order flow to-date is, across both ACG and LSAG as well as our DGG business which is a smaller piece, tracking to our expectations. Yes. Yes. And we are expecting a faster growth in Q2. Yes. And Dan, the other part of your question was -- Yes. So just quickly, our spending forecast in 2020 is the same as 2019. So we are not expecting any ramp up. Yes. We talked about at the beginning of the year, our guide was contemplating roughly a flattish gross margin across the company and that hasn't changed. So we have always said that the first half of the year, with Q1 being the hardest of comparison because of the startup costs in NASD and you can see that kind of in our numbers. We also were affected a little less, as we mentioned before, in LSAG. We would expect that to recover as we get through the course of the year. So at a high level, Derek, I would expect our gross margins still to be within that range, roughly flat year-over-year. And where we are getting our operating leverage is really in the OpEx expense line. Yes. Yes. Hi Derek. This Bob. I think the short answer on your first question is, yes. We are still in that range of roughly flat. Actually if you looked at Q1, we were down 2% core, but if you adjust it for the Coronavirus, it would been down about 1% on the most difficult comp that we had. To your point around C&E, there have been chutes of life and some of our customers looking at things. Now what I would say is the Coronavirus kind of froze some of that into question. But I would say, that's still intact right now. I don't know. Jacob, if you have anything? So you have get very good math and we are not expecting a step down. The only thing that's in the numbers and that could be an area of potential opportunity. Yes. We will pro forma that. That's right. No. I think you are getting -- Yes. Exactly, I think that's a likely area. That and pharma. Yes. Nothing material, Vijay. Sure. Yes. Let me make sure I answer your question correctly. What I would say is, Q1 came in slightly better than what we expected on the ramp. So we feel very good about that trajectory. Obviously, you know the second half of the year is going to be significantly greater than the first half of the year as we ramp up that business. And I would say that the order book, we feel very good about. Yes. I would say, Steve, one thing. Obviously 90 days ago, we didn't have the epidemic that we are seeing right now which is unprecedented. And so what we are trying to do is we are seeing, hey, in the first half of the year, we are expecting a $25 million to $50 million impact that we are going to make up in the second half of the year. Now the question is, how fast. And we hope for everyone's sake that that will ramp up fast and we will get this behind us. But that's certainly puts a lot more variability in our forecast. We feel good about where our forecast is. But we certainly didn't anticipate that at the beginning of the year. Hi Bill. Yes. And Bill, as you can appreciate, timing there is always very difficult to understand and we are going to remain disciplined. And if there isn't anything out there that would meet our financial criteria, we are not going to do it. We don't need to do M&A to make our model work. But certainly, you see in the first quarter the benefit that we have seen with BioTek and really building scale in cell analysis, which we think has a long term growth opportunity for us, not only in LSAG but across the business. Yes. The beauty of ACG has been it's predictability across the business and we are not expecting any dramatic change in the back half of the year with the possible exception of slightly an elevated ramp in China. But that business that Mark and team have built has been just phenomenal in terms of providing stable high growth and profitable growth over the course of the last several years. And I think that that, quite honestly, is a great legacy to what Mark has been able to accomplish. And not only that, it really speaks to what our customers are looking for in terms of productivity in the labs and so forth. So we would expect that to continue to kind of chug along as we have talked about in the past."

The Agilent team delivered another excellent quarter to close out an outstanding, record-setting 2021. At $6.32 billion for fiscal 2021, revenues are almost $1 billion higher than last year. Full year, core growth is up 15% on top of growing 1% last year. The strength is broad-based with our three business units all growing more than 10% core for the year. Our full year operating margins are up 200 basis points. Earnings per share of $4.34 are up 32%. Let\u2019s now take a closer look at our strong finish to 2021 and review Q4 results. Our momentum continues as orders increased faster than revenue in Q4 and at the same time, we delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth.  At $1.66 billion, revenues are up 12% on a reported basis. Our core revenues grew 11%, exceeding our expectations. This is on top of 6% core growth last year. Our Q4 operating margin is 26.5%. This is up 160 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.21, up 23% year-over-year. Our earnings growth also exceeded our expectations. We continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market growing 21%, driven by our biopharma business. Total pharma now represents 36% of our overall revenue. This compares to 31% of our revenues just two years ago. The strong growth in our chemical and energy business continues, as we delivered 11% growth in the quarter. This is on top of growing 3% in Q4 of last year. PMI numbers are positive and we expect that chemical and energy will continue its strong growth trajectory into fiscal 2022. In diagnostics and clinical, revenues grew 11% on top of growing 1% last year, as testing volumes started to recover.  On a geographic basis, our results were led by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Our business in the Americas grew 15% on top of 5% last year. China grew 8% core on top of strong 13% growth in Q4 of last year. China order growth outpaced revenue growth for the third quarter in a row. Now, looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $747 million. LSAG is up 11% on both a reported and a core basis. LSAG\u2019s growth was broad-based and led by strength in liquid chromatography and cell analysis. The pharma and chemical and energy markets were particularly strong for new instrument purchases. Our cell analysis business crossed the $100 million revenue mark in the quarter for the first time. During the quarter, the LSAG team announced a new Ion Mobility LC/Q-TOF and enhancements to our VWorks automation software suite. These new, well-received offerings are used to improve the analysis of proteins and peptides to speed development of new protein-based therapeutics. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $572 million. This is up a reported 10% and 9% core. Growth is broad-based driven by strength in service contracts and on-demand services, as well as for chemistries and supplies. Our focus on increasing connect rates continues to pay off for us.  The strong expansion of our installed base in 2021 and increasing connect rates bodes well for continued strength in our ACG business moving forward. Our ability to drive growth and leverage our scale produced operating margins of roughly 30%, up more than 200 basis points from the prior year. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $341 million, up 16% reported and up 13% core. Our NASD oligo business led the way with robust double-digit growth in the quarter and achieved full-year revenues exceeding $225 million. We expect another year of strong double-digit growth as the team continues to do a great job of increasing throughput with the existing capacity. The additional expansion of our \u201cTrain B\u201d oligo manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado is proceeding as planned. We expect this additional capacity to come online by the end of calendar year2022. Moving on from our other business group updates, there were several other significant developments for Agilent this quarter. We announced our commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We believe our approach delivers the same rigor to sustainability that we apply to everything else we do. We also believe these actions are not only the right thing to do, but fundamental to achieving long-term success. Our sustainability leadership continues to be prominently recognized, as well. You may have seen that Investors\u2019 Business Daily recently named Agilent to its Top 100 ESG Companies list. We are also a company where diversity and inclusion represent a company priority and is a core element of our culture. During the quarter, we achieved recognition by Forbes as one of the World\u2019s Best Employers, and as a Best Workplace for Women. While the Agilent team has a strong track record of delivering above market growth and leading customer satisfaction, we are always looking to do more. To further accelerate growth and strengthen our focus on customers, we are implementing a new One Agilent Commercial organization, combining, for the first-time, all customer-facing activities under one leader. The new organization brings together and strengthens our sales, marketing, digital channel, and services team. The new enterprise-level commercial organization is led by Padraig McDonnell. Padraig will continue to lead the Agilent CrossLab Group as Business Group President, as well as serve as Agilent\u2019s first-ever Chief Commercial Officer. The way I like to characterize this move is to say we are \u201cdoubling-down\u201d on the success we\u2019ve achieved with ACG applying a holistic, customer-focused approach to all aspects of our business.  We are also moving the Chemistries and Supplies Division to LSAG. This closer organizational alignment between instrument and chemistries development will further accelerate our progress on instrument connect rates for chemistries and consumables. We believe that \u201cstructure follows strategy\u201d and that this new organizational structure will further enhance our customer focus and the execution of our growth strategies. Looking ahead to the coming year, we are in a strong position to continue to deliver on our \u201cbuild and buy\u201d growth strategy. Agilent\u2019s business remains strong. We enter the New Year with a robust backlog and have multiple growth drivers, coupled with the proven execution excellence of the Agilent team. A year ago, during our Agilent Investor Day, we raised our long-term annual growth outlook to the 5% to 7% range, while reaffirming our commitment to annual operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth. We are now one year in and well on our way to achieving these long-term goals. Bob will provide more details, but for fiscal 2022 our initial full-year guide calls for core growth in a range of 5.5% to 7%. We expect to continue our top-line growth as we launch market-leading products and services, invest in fast-growing businesses, and deliver outstanding customer service.  My confidence in the unstoppable One Agilent team and our ability to execute and deliver remains firmly intact. This is our formula for delivering solid financial results, outstanding shareholder returns and continued strong growth. We are very pleased with our performance in 2021, but not satisfied. As I tell the Agilent team: The best is yet to come, for our customers, our team, and our shareholders.  Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?\nBob McMahon: Thanks Mike, and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our initial outlook for the upcoming year and for the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike mentioned, we had very strong results in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.66 billion, reflecting reported growth of 12%. Before I get into the details, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team, which has been doing a great job managing in a very challenging global environment. Core revenue growth at 11% was a point above our top end guidance range. Currency accounted for 0.8% of growth, while M&A contributed 0.5% of growth during Q4. And as expected, COVID-19 related revenues were roughly flat sequentially and resulted in just over a point headwind to the quarterly core growth. Late in the quarter, we did see transit times that were in certain cases greater than anticipated resulting in some revenues being deferred into Q1. Our results were driven by a continuation of outstanding momentum in pharma, and in biopharma in particular, while chemical and energy and diagnostics and clinical also delivered strong results for us. Our largest market, pharma grew 21% during the quarter against a tough compare of 12% last year. The small molecule segment delivered mid-teens growth, while large molecule grew 31%. Pharma was a standout all year, growing 24% for the full year after growing 6% in 2020. And in FY22, we expect our pharma business to grow in the high-single digits.  Chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 11% with instrument growth in the mid-teens during the quarter. This impressive performance was against a 3% increase last year. The C&E business grew 12% for the year, after declining 3% in 2020. Growth was driven by continued momentum in chemicals and engineered materials and we expect our C&E business to continue to grow solidly next year in the high-single-digits. Diagnostics and clinical grew 11% with all three groups growing nicely during the quarter. While the largest dollar contributor to this market is DGG driven by our pathology-related businesses, the LSAG business continues to penetrate the clinical market and drive growth with strong performances by cell analysis and mass spec.  We saw mid-teens growth in the Americas and strong growth in China, albeit off a small base. For the year, the diagnostics and clinical business grew 15% for the year after declining slightly by 1% in 2020. And we expect to continue to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits in 2022. Academia and government, which can be lumpy and represents less than 10% of our business was up 1% in Q4 versus a flat growth last year. Most research labs continue to remain open globally and increase capacity to pre-pandemic levels.  China came in at low-single-digits, while the Americas and Europe were roughly flat. For the year, we grew 7% after declining 4% last year. We expect this market will continue to improve slightly in fiscal year 2022 and expect growth of low to mid-single-digits. Food was flat during the quarter against a very tough 16% compare. Europe and the Americas grew while China declined. For the year, food grew 13% after growing 7% in 2020. Looking forward, we expect food to return to historical growth rates in the low-single-digits.  And rounding out the markets, environmental and forensics declined 2% in the fourth quarter, off a 5% decline last year, as growth in environmental was overshadowed by a decline in forensics. For the year, we grew 5% off a 2% decline in 2020.  And looking forward, like food, we expect environmental and forensics to grow in the low-single-digits in the coming year. For Agilent overall, on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in Q4 led by the Americas at 15%. China grew 8%, and Europe grew 4%. And for the year, Americas led the way with 21% growth, followed by China at 13% and Europe at 12%. Now let\u2019s turn to the rest of the P&L, fourth quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 90 basis points from a year ago. Gross margin performance, along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in an operating margin for the fourth quarter of 26.5%, improving 160 basis points over last year. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.21, up 23% versus last year. And during the quarter, we benefitted from some additional tax savings resulting in a quarterly tax rate of 13% and our full-year tax rate was 14.25%. Our share count was 305 million shares, as expected. And for the year, EPS came in at $4.34, an increase of 32% from 2020. We continued our strong cash flow generation, resulting in $441 million for the quarter, an increase of 17% versus last year. For all of 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in operating cash and invested $188 million in capital expenditures. During the quarter, we returned $195 million to our shareholders paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 830,000 shares for $136 million. And for the year, we returned over a $1 billion to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the year with $1.5 billion in cash and $2.7 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.7. All in all, a great end to an outstanding year. Now let\u2019s move on to our outlook for the fiscal 2022. While we are still dealing with the pandemic and we have the additional challenges around logistics and inflationary pressures, we enter the year with strong backlog and momentum. For the full year, we are expecting revenue to range between $6.65 billion and $6.73 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 6.5% and core growth of 5.5% to 7% consistent with our long range goals. And this incorporates absorbing roughly a half a point headwind associated with COVID-related revenues, with the majority of that impact coming in Q1. We are expecting all three of our businesses to grow, led by DGG. We expect DGG to grow high-single-digits with the continued contribution of NASD and cancer diagnostics. We expect ACG to grow at high-single-digits with both services and our chemistries and supplies businesses growing comparably, while LSAG is expected to grow in mid-single-digits. We expect operating margin expansion of 60 to 80 basis points for the year as we absorb the build out costs of Train B at our Frederick, Colorado NASD site. And in helping you build out your models, we are planning for a tax rate of 14.25%, consistent with current tax policies, and 305 million fully diluted shares outstanding. All this translates to a fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS expected to be between $4.76 to $4.86 per share resulting in double-digit growth. And finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and capital expenditures of $300 million. This capital investment represents an increase over 2021 as we continue our focus on growth, bringing our NASD Train B expansion online and expanding consumables manufacturing capacity for our cell analysis and genomics businesses. We have also announced raising our dividend by 8% continuing an important streak of dividend increases and providing another source of value to our shareholders. Now, let\u2019s move on to our first quarter guidance, but before I get into the specifics, some additional context. Lunar New Year is February 1st this year, a shift from last year when it was in mid-February. As a result, we expect some Q1 revenue to shift to the second quarter this year as customers shut down ahead of the holiday.  In addition, as I mentioned, we do expect to see the largest impact of COVID-related revenue headwinds in the first quarter. We estimate these two factors will impact our base business growth by 2 to 3 points and are roughly equal in impact. For Q1, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.64 billion to $1.66 billion, representing reported and core growth of 5.9% to 7.2%. Adjusting for the timing of Lunar New Year and COVID-related headwinds, core growth would be roughly 8% to 10% in the quarter. First quarter 2022 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.16 to $1.18.  And a couple additional points before opening the call for questions. In conjunction with new One Agilent Commercial organization Mike talked about, we will be reporting under the new structure starting in Q1.  In addition, we will be providing a recast of certain LSAG and ACG historical financials to account for the segment changes after the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in December. I am extremely proud of what the Agilent team achieved in 2021 and look forward to another strong performance in 2022. With that, Parmeet, back to you for Q&A.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Bob. Bethany, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore. You may proceed. \nVijay Kumar: Hey guys. Congrats on a nice print here and thanks for taking my question. Maybe as to my first one on\u2026 \nMike McMullen: Thanks, Vijay. \nVijay Kumar: Mike, maybe my first one on the guidance here. A lot of questions around supply chain inflationary environment. The guide of 5.5% to 7% core growth for fiscal 2022, what is that assuming for pricing versus volume? And does it assume any contribution from interest run? \nBob McMahon: Hey, Vijay, this is Bob. I did get the last part of your question, maybe. Yes, so, on the price, we do have built in roughly a point of price into our plan which is slightly higher than what we had this year, Vijay. And in terms of inclusion, we won\u2019t get into individual customer products, but what I would say is NASD is expecting another year of very strong growth. \nVijay Kumar: And just on that last point, Bob, and maybe, Mike for you,\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nVijay Kumar: I think the Analyst Day outlook had NASD ramping up quite meaningfully. Has anything changed on NASD it did capacity ramp up by timing change at all and I am curious on just around on anything changed \u2013 your response letter to no orders? \nMike McMullen: Not at all. What I would say, the one big change is the business is doing even better than we had communicated at December of last year. So really appreciate the question. As you know, in my \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking about the new capacity coming online and that\u2019s still gone right per schedule, in fact, we distributed earlier last week and that\u2019s still to come on online by the end of calendar 2022.  But I think the team has just done a fabulous job, which is we are going to be able to grow double-digit in 2022 even without the new capacity, because they are able to continue to drive process improvements of broader book of business and larger batches. So the business is really on fire. I mean we are very, very happy with it. \nBob McMahon: Yes. Vijay, if we looked at our order backlog, we are taking orders for 2023 already. \nMike McMullen: Yes. I have met Bob the other day, Vijay that a year ago we are talking about could we fill out the factory? Could it ramp and we\u2019ve blown right through that. \nVijay Kumar: Yes. That\u2019s fantastic, Mike. And just sorry to clarify post the complete response letter to Nord, there is no change in interest around assumptions for you guys, correct? \nMike McMullen: No. No. \nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Thank you, guys. \nMike McMullen: You are welcome. Appreciate the feedback. \nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Kumar. The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. You may proceed. \nMike McMullen: Tycho? Tycho, I think you are on.\nOperator: Your line is now open. \nMike McMullen: Moving to the next in the queue. \nOperator: Okay. The next question comes from the line \u2013 excuse me, of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. You may proceed. \nBrandon Couillard : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. \nMike McMullen: Hey, Brandon. \nBrandon Couillard : Mike, maybe just \u2013 Mike, maybe just starting with the guide for next year. You just kind of talked through some of the variable upside, downside that you considered when building the outlook. I\u2019d be curious what you\u2019ve embedded for China specifically, as well? \nMike McMullen: Yes, when I talk about the \u2013 what we see is the potential upside in the guide and Bob, maybe you can talk about the \u2013 our China assumptions. And by the way, we are \u2013 hope we came through, so we are very happy with the momentum we have in China. I think the upside fits with our two largest end-markets, pharma and chemical energy.  And as Bob indicated in his script, we are assuming high-singles, I believe, Bob, for the pharma market really coming off just toward growth here in 2021. That high-level growth continues, that would represent upside in our biggest market. And we\u2019ve got a lot of early positive things happened in the pharma side of things. Pharma, let\u2019s say, C&E as well, right, Bob.  So we\u2019ve always \u2013 I think this is the most bullish language that I\u2019ve had in a call for sometime about the C&E. So you can imagine there has been even some caution about not over plan or too much. But I\u2019d say the two \u2013 our two largest end-markets represent the highest \u2013 where we think we may have some upside relative to our initial first guide for the year.  Bob, can you remind what we had assumed for China? \nBob McMahon: Yes, Brandon, it\u2019s a good question on China and we continue to be very positive on China. If we look at our backlog, our order growth rate has increased higher than our revenue for the last three quarters. We exited 2021 with a record backlog going into 2022 for China. And our guidance comprehends high-single-digit growth in China. So, both being led by \u2013 from a geographic basis, growth will be led by Americas and China going forward. \nBrandon Couillard : Okay. And then, Mike, in terms of the new organization structure, why need the COO role now? And then, correct me if I am wrong, are you planning to collapse ACG into the LSAG segment entirely?\nMike McMullen: Yes, no, thanks for that clarifying question. So, let me handle the second part of your question first, which is the ACG group will be 100% services in 2022 and then we are moving over the CSD, the chemistry and supplies portion of that business over to Jacob, for two reasons. One is, just the breadth of responsibility that product would have as we had made that change.  But we think that\u2019s going to be a driver of growth and I ask Jacob to make a comment on that here in a second, because I think they have these teams even closer together. We are going to be able to even further accelerate our connect rates on instruments for our chemistry products. Why the change? Hey, it\u2019s best to make, when things are going really well, it\u2019s really time to put down the hammer and really go as hard as you can and that\u2019s what we are doing here.  So, as you may know, when I first came in as CEO, I had five sales forces. I collapsed those into two. This is next evolution of that overall transformation of the company with this One Agilent culture behind it. The real belief is that the segmentation of our markets really calls for a much more of a customer orientation as opposed to product-centric view of how we want to sell and reach our customers.  And you think about the scale as you get with the digital platforms, digital infrastructure, our services organization, this makes sense to do this volume on top of your game. So, all things are going well, we thought it was really time to pit the seller down even further. And Jacob, you wouldn\u2019t mind just to comment to what you are thinking about your new responsibilities? \nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Thanks for that, Mike and I am sure that things got with now that you see the consumables product where it is, so we can truly build out end-to-end solutions that will really drive customer expectations and I think Padraig and the team have over the past few years in fact shown that the design end consumables can really drive a tremendous connect rates. So I think that already shown the path forward and now all being completely into LSAG, we can really accelerate that. \nBrandon Couillard : And, hey, thanks for that Jacob. And then, maybe just to close off this line of response, any thoughts about your additional new responsibilities?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks, Mike. First of all, really excited about the new role and I think the unified commercial strategy and organization will really continue to strengthen Agilent\u2019s customer focus and help us to align capabilities for the future where we are going to kind of maximize the connect rate and customer lifetime value.  And also, I think accelerate execution of our digital ambitions for both delivering near-term growth and strategically invest for the future. So, very excited and already building on what is a great capability in the company. \nBrandon Couillard : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. \nMike McMullen: Thanks, Brandon, appreciate the questions. \nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Couillard. The next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. You may proceed. \nDerik de Bruin : Hi. Good afternoon. \nMike McMullen: Hey, Derik. \nDerik de Bruin : Hey. Just maybe \u2013 so, a couple of questions. I guess, can you talk a little bit about the market expansion 68 at this point is and just repeat that out. You got some inflationary pressures. You got some FX. You\u2019ve got some COVID headwinds coming off. Can you just provide what\u2019s the underlying market expansion is just sort of normalizes, you have obviously the capacity coming on car rails. Just how should we think about the margins and just the different pieces? \nMike McMullen: Bob, do you want to take that? \nBob McMahon: Yes. Yes. Thanks, Derik. It\u2019s a great question. And what we\u2019ve been able to do even in this last quarter in the phase of inflationary pressures is be able to drive pretty significant margin expansion across our businesses. And so, as we think about the 60 to 80 basis points to put kind of as perspective, we are anticipating roughly 15 basis point headwind associated with that train B build up and that\u2019s hiring the people and getting the product coming online and so forth.  And so, if we think about that, that\u2019s closer to 75 to close to that 100 basis points. A lot of that\u2019s going to come through SG&A operating leverage and the activities associated with just not growing our business expenses as fast as the top-line. And we are going to be looking to cover some of the inflationary pressures on the top-line with that price that I talked about before which we didn\u2019t really have any significant price in 2021.  We have started to see that. We took quick action earlier this year to reflect that and so a combination of it. Most if it being in OpEx leverage, but there will be some small operating leverage at the top-line as well, if you take out the \u2013 excuse me, at the gross margin, if you take out the NASD expenses as a result of covering our cost through pricing increases. \nDerik de Bruin : Thanks. And then just a couple of quick follow-ups. Any evidence of stocking transportation supply chains degree on the consumable side and just an update on ResBio, that looks like it so lagging its largest rotations? Thank you. \nMike McMullen: Hey, Derik, a follow-up on those two questions and so, and I have Sam coming on the second question. So, we\u2019ve not seen any real evidence of stocking on the consumables. So, I think that\u2019s pretty interesting, right, Bob? \nBob McMahon: That\u2019s great. \nMike McMullen: Yes. Yes. And then, what you are going to hear from Sam in a minute he will provide a little bit of color, we remain very, very bullish about the long-term prospects with ResBio and a lot of the work has been done to develop new opportunities with our pharma partners. But we are already on the short-term as well. Sam?\nSam Raha: Yes. Hey. Thanks, Mike. In terms of Q4, whereas the revenue came in a little bit below expectations and that\u2019s driven in part by COVID-19 related delays in clinical trial enrollment. Overall, the interest that we are seeing both from our existing customers on the pharma side that we\u2019ve been doing I see work with, as well as new customers that\u2019s very, very real.  In fact, we\u2019ve now signed an agreement which is our first with a large existing customer giving evidence to the interest that\u2019s there in terms of the work that we are doing on the PMAs. These are approvals related to existing agreements with our Resolution Bioscience business. We are making good progress on that.  And so, lot of the momentum in a number of areas. So, very pleased to have them as part of our business to really bring together the strategy we\u2019ve had which is to be the companion diagnostic development and commercialization partner leveraging multiple modalities including immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing. \nDerik de Bruin : Thanks, Sam. \nOperator: Thank you, Mr. de Bruin. The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson. I do apologize. The next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. You may proceed. \nDan Leonard: Hi, good afternoon. \nMike McMullen: Good afternoon, Dan. \nBob McMahon: Hey, Dan. \nDan Leonard: So my first question relates to the 2022 guide. What are some of the factors that might pull performance back down to the mid-single digit range, specifically, something that would start with the five handle? \nMike McMullen: Yes. I think, what I would say is, first of all, I think our guidance is prudent given the beginning of the year. If we saw continued, greater than expected disruptions in the supply chain that may impact demand, particularly in some of the applied markets that could do it.  Although we haven\u2019t seen that, to be very clear, Dan. We feel very good about where we are given our forecast and backlog. So we are \u2013 I would say are, we have bias towards the upside in our forecast as opposed to bias towards the downside. \nDan Leonard: Appreciate that. And then, a follow-up on the shift in chemicals and supplies from ACG to LSAG. Is the logic behind the move is to increase the connect rate? Can you remind me where is the connect rate today and where you want it to be over some period of time? \nMike McMullen: Yes. It\u2019s a great question and the team continues to do a great job under Padraig\u2019s leadership here to do that both at the purchase and then on the ongoing aftermarket. What I would say is, right now, if you look at the overall attach rate, it\u2019s probably in the mid-20s right now. And if you look at the attach rates year-on-year, we saw very nice growth on the new placements.  So, all the new instruments that Jacob and team have been able to sell, that\u2019s why we feel very good about the ACG business going forward. So, we still have a long way to go there in terms of opportunity across both the services as well as the consumables. Some of our competitors are higher than that and so we\u2019ve got aspirations that are well above that mid 20s.  And Dan, I just like to make sure this clear, we are not making this change because we were dissatisfied with the improvements in that connect rates. This is icing on top of the cake before that accelerated as we look to balance span of control and business responsibilities with the real driver was the one commercial \u2013 creation of the one commercial organization.  And I think this is a nice secondary benefit that we are actually going to get, we think even more focus and header alignment between our product development groups on the CSD side and instrument side. \nDan Leonard: Helpful clarification, Mike. Thank you. \nMike McMullen: You are welcome. \nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Leonard. The next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. You may proceed. \nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. \nMike McMullen: Sure, Puneet. \nPuneet Souda: Bob, thanks. So, first one is on environmental. I mean, you have a leading position there with a number of products across the LSAG product line. Maybe just could you elaborate a bit more for us what\u2019s going on there? Specifically, related to China, the timing in China, is that just Lunar New Year? Is there something more that we need to consider? \nMike McMullen: Yes. I think this is \u2013 let me start, Bob, you can jump in on this. So, I think when we talk about environmental and forensics, I think it\u2019s a tale of two cities. So, buried in that number is a decline in forensics and I think that\u2019s probably really tied to governments prioritizing other investments in this COVID-19 world.  The demand is not there. I think relative to China, it\u2019s been more about priorities. Right now, they are shifting some of their priorities towards the pharma and other COVID-19 related type investments. So, I think that\u2019s probably, I mean\u2026\nBob McMahon: Yes, the only thing I would add on that Mike is, there is some shift, but it\u2019s also timing. \nMike McMullen: Yes. Yes. \nBob McMahon: There are some\u2026 \nMike McMullen: Something\u2026\nBob McMahon: Yes, yes, there is some budget that we\u2019ve seen that has shifted into our fiscal first quarter and into FY 2022 in particular in China. I think long-term, we still see the importance of the environmental testing in China and around the world remains to be seen or is still intact, Puneet. And it\u2019s more a function of timing than anything. \nMike McMullen: And thanks for jumping in on that, Bob, because we still are very, very confident about our ability to grow environment builds in China I think it\u2019s well known the government\u2019s real emphasis on continuing to make improvements in the quality of life of citizens. \nPuneet Souda: Got it. And then, just on the liquid chromatography, just staying on that point, I\u2019d really appreciate your comments on the chemistry columns and consumables now being part of LSAG, but when we look at the business overall today, you obviously have a strong 1200 series offering.  We are also seeing pickup from another competitor in the market space that had lost some share over the last few years and there seems like they are gaining some back. But just wondering what you are seeing in the field and in terms of further competition in this side of the market, we\u2019ll appreciate any thoughts. Thank you. \nMike McMullen: Yes, hey Jacob. I lead off on here and I mean, I first want to say is the key competitors in the LC market remain unchanged. Nobody new in the market and what I can tell you is that, we are very, very happy with where we are in liquid chromatography. So we are not playing any kind of catch-up game at all here. We delivered high-teens growth in the quarter and exited the year with record backlog and our growth rate in orders were significantly higher than our revenue growth rate.  And I think, Jacob, it\u2019s fair to say that the strength is both on the large and small molecule size with the real standout of China geographically. And I think you exited the year, but we see as record backlog. So we are really bullish on our LC business and maybe you want to have some additional comments?\nJacob Thaysen : Yes. Thanks, Mike. It\u2019s something to be proud of and I am \u2013 I feel really good where we are right now. As you said, we are growing very strongly. As I can see, when I look into the market, we are in a very strong position versus our competition also. And just a reminder, we - a few quarters ago, we did announced that we have expanded our Bio LC portfolio substantially. So we really have the full range of Bio LCs out there.  But we also have 2D-LCs and also online LCs to really drive growth in that area. So a Bio LC really came timely with all the investment that goes into large molecules right now. So I truly believe we have momentum and we\u2019ll continue with that over the next period of time.\nPuneet Souda : Great. Thanks, guys.\nMike McMullen : Thanks, Jacob.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Souda. The next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. You may proceed.\nPatrick Donnelly : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.\nMike McMullen : Hello, Patrick.\nPatrick Donnelly : Bob, maybe one for you to start, just on the margin side. I know you talked about 60 to 80 BPS of expansion. It sounds like the NASD facility might be a little bit of a headwind. Can you just talk through the moving pieces there? I know you called out price a little bit, as well. Can you just talk about the levers and how much of an offset the facility is, as we can kind of think about the underlying number as well?\nBob McMahon : Yes. So, I would say, maybe on NASD, if I look at it and I break it into two components. If I look at it with the existing capacity, that team not only has driven top-line growth, but if we looked at the margin, it actually is accretive to the overall Agilent margin. So that team has done a fabulous job ramping up.\nMike McMullen : It\u2019s accretive, right?\nBob McMahon : Accretive, yes, very nicely. And so, we are making the investment on Train B. It\u2019s roughly 15 basis points. That\u2019s inclusive of that 60 to 80. So it\u2019s a roughly $10 million to $15 million of incremental cost associated with the training and investments as the lines come on board. And so, we are seeing that and take that to a side because those are kind of discrete. And if I look at the business, what we are seeing is the faster growing areas. We actually are seeing a benefit of mix. And so, we talked a little bit about cell analysis but also cell analysis in LSAG has been very accretive both on the gross margin, as well as the operating profit side. And so, we\u2019ve got these faster growing businesses that are helping with mix and then we are adding on the incremental price to cover the inflationary pressures that we are seeing and so forth.  But we\u2019ve also got productivity measures in place and this is where I think the One Agilent approach to our systems and our infrastructure really pays dividends, because we are able to leverage those costs across a larger base and because a lot of that is internal, we don\u2019t have that same level of pressure on cost as we are seeing in some other areas.  And so, it\u2019s a combination of product mix, that price. I talked about 1% price and then leverage in the operating expense side.\nPatrick Donnelly : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Bob. And then, Mike maybe one for you on C&E. I know, in the script, you kind of called out maybe having the most positive tone you\u2019ve had in a little while here on that segment. Obviously the end-market health seems pretty high from the customers. And can you just talk about, I guess, the conversations you\u2019re having there, visibility, again, guiding to high single for next year off a pretty strong 2021 is encouraging.  So maybe just your confidence and then again, it sounds like maybe there\u2019s even some upside to that number?\nMike McMullen : Yes. Sure, Patrick. So, yes, so we are seeing really good end market demand for and I think Bob highlighted a lot of those like the advanced materials or chemicals. It really speaks to the overall recovery economically on a global basis and the fact that this in particular, this customer base had deferred a lot of investments for some period of time.  So, they are in a reinvestment mode and we have pretty good visibility to the funnel. So, I think we probably got at least a six month lead view on what\u2019s coming down on instrument purchases. So, we are feeling really good about the C&E business as well as there is the ACG story here as well of where we are continuing to increase services in this segment, which has historically been more of a self-maintainer kind of market, as well as the chemistries and consumables side.  So, I think we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility, given our confidence and be able to put this kind of number out there in a full year guide at this point in time. Bob, anything else you\u2019d add to that? I know we spend a lot of time talking about this.\nBob McMahon : No, I think you got it. You said it well.\nPatrick Donnelly : Great. Thanks, Mike.\nBob McMahon : You are quite welcome.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Donnelly. The next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. You may proceed.\nJosh Waldman : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start with a quick follow-up on supply chain.\nBob McMahon : Sure, sure.\nJosh Waldman : Yes. Hey, Bob. Wanted to start with a quick follow-up on supply chain. I wondered if you could give us the magnitude of the push-outs you referenced and is this all LSAG?\nMike McMullen : Well, I am going to pass it to Bob here in a second, but let me really clear in terms of our language. When I use supply chain, that means material constraints and then we have logistics. I think, of the issues that Bob, the transit times was really logistics issue. In terms of our ability to get product to customers and get the raw materials, we feel pretty good about what\u2019s been going on there so.\nBob McMahon : Yes, exactly. So it was more just longer delivery times and Josh, it was in the LSAG business, as you would expect. It was roughly a point in the quarter.\nJosh Waldman : Okay. And given the transient nature, it sounds like you are assuming this all hits in the first quarter. Is that kind of what\u2019s embedded in your guide?\nBob McMahon : We are assuming that it will get better over the course of the first half of next year or first half of the fiscal year. So not all of it will come back in Q1.\nJosh Waldman : Got it, okay. And then, I wanted to follow-up on your comments within the LC/MS franchise. I believe, in your prepared remarks, you highlighted stronger install rates in this franchise in the fourth quarter. Just wondered if you could provide any additional color on that, maybe what\u2019s driving it? Is it higher or faster kind of accelerated refresh levels at legacy accounts? Or maybe you\u2019re seeing kind of increased win rates at new accounts?\nMike McMullen : I am going to \u2013 great question. I am going to pass that to our expert on this topic. Jacob, maybe you want to talk about what\u2019s going on in the LC/MS front.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Certainly, Mike and as you mentioned, we had great success with our new Ion Mobility, 6560C that we launched here at ASMS and we had a fantastic worker and user meeting also that was rally all subscribed. But as you also speak to, we had tremendous traction on our triple core and single cord businesses.  And particularly in the biopharma space, we see a lot of smaller accounts also coming live, small mid-sized accounts that are starting to build up their capabilities within the analytical instruments business. So we see a lot of tremendous momentum there. But obviously, also the big accounts that is more in the refresh mode.\nMike McMullen : Yes. So, I think part of the story, Josh, is new customers, right, particularly on the biopharma side and also doing very well on the refresh side with existing customers.\nJosh Waldman : Got it. Yes. Really appreciate it guys.\nMike McMullen : You are quite welcome.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Waldman. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Gokay with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nPaul Knight : Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Paul Knight. Thanks for the time.\nMike McMullen : Hey, Paul. How are you doing?\nPaul Knight : Good, good. On the Avantor agreement, is there any way you can talk about - does that give you another 5% of addressable market? What are your thoughts around that deal?\nMike McMullen : Yes. Hey, thanks for noticing that we had worked with Michael\u2019s team and have a real agreement we are really excited about. And I\u2019m actually going to pass it over to Agilent\u2019s new Commercial Officer to his view on that question. Go ahead, Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell : Yes. I think, yes, thanks, Mike. I think we see that it\u2019s a really mutual beneficial arrangement that we are going to see not only different customers, but at different spaces within customers and it also helps with overall the addressable market and coverage. So, the Agilent team and the Avantor team will be able to share leads and so on so we\u2019ll be able to cover the market better.  We\u2019ll also be able to use our digital capabilities to be able to find new customers and also increase the wallet share and customer side. So all around, a very positive development.\nMike McMullen : And Paul, it\u2019s hard to put an exact percentage on the question. But we wouldn\u2019t be doing it if it was on the margin.\nBob McMahon : Yeah. And I was going to say, Paul, this is Bob. Just to add, I mean, we didn\u2019t really see any revenue. That\u2019s all future opportunity for us. And I think one of the areas that Avantor is strong is in the research area, Academia and Government, and this will help us even cover that market even broader than we do today.\nMike McMullen : Yes. Absolutely.\nPaul Knight : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with Cowen. You may proceed.\nDan Brennan : Hey, Mike. Hey, Bob. How are you guys doing?\nMike McMullen : All right, Dan. How about yourself? \nDan Brennan : Thank you. Thank you. Doing well, doing well. Maybe first question on NASD, maybe I missed it. Did you guys give a number for 2022, what\u2019s implied?\nBob McMahon : We did not, but what we did say is, we would expect strong double-digit growth. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Yes, what I can tell you is we exited at a run rate that was higher than the - if you took our $225 million that we talked about and divided by four, our runrate was higher than that.\nMike McMullen : Right.\nBob McMahon : So we continue to ramp.\nMike McMullen : Yes, thanks for that question. It was hard to explain it in the call narrative. But as Bob mentioned, our Q4 exit rate is higher than the full year number.\nDan Brennan : And maybe could you give a little color there. I think, Bob, you mentioned in the prepared remarks or in Q&A that you\u2019re taking in orders to 2023. Could you just give us a sense like what the utilization is today of your capacity that\u2019s available and any color about demand trends book of business things of that nature?\nBob McMahon : Yes. In short, we are running 24/7 at both our Frederick facility, as well as our Boulder facility, which was a legacy facility. And we are \u2013 I feel very good about our ability to continue to expand capacity. What Brian and team have been able to do is increase both throughput, as well as yield. And so, that\u2019s really helped us drive additional capacity with the existing footprint or the existing manufacturing facility.  And the Train B, as we talked about has the opportunity to add more than $100 million of incremental volume coming online starting at the end of this - our fiscal - our calendar 2022.\nDan Brennan : Got it. And then, maybe on the One Agilent, Mike, could you just give us, I know, Mike, when you got there, you made some changes to the sales force that have made under your predecessor, now you are going further. So how should we see this manifest from the outside over the next, I don\u2019t know, one to two years?  Does this \u2013 could this lead to stronger growth? Is it going to lead to more better margins, more durable growth? Just obviously the customers are going to see something, but how will that manifest in reported results, do you think?\nMike McMullen : I think it\u2019s a check for each one of the things you listed there. But the number one reason why we are doing is to drive more growth. And it\u2019s just a natural evolution of the transformation in the sales force. I started a number of years ago. And it really points to the fact that we have this broad-based portfolio that\u2019s selling into the same customer base.  And why have two separate sales forces and have to go do the coordination between across sales forces, and then the big push that we made over the last several years in terms of digital, this allow us, I believe, to even go faster on realizing our digital ambitions. And then you\u2019ve got the voice of the customer will be right in the CEO\u2019s staff and on Padraig\u2019s table, the Head of the service delivery organization. So, everything relative to the customer facing that we do in this company will be under one leader. We just think it\u2019s going to find ways to accelerate our growth, increase our customer satisfaction, and I think as we push more and more of our business because customers want to buy that way through digital, it will have a natural knock-on effect of efficiency gains in the P&L.\nDan Brennan : Great. And then, maybe one more, obviously, balance sheet is in great shape. So, the proverbial question about M&A, just wondering what does the funnel look like? Any update on the strategy? I know you\u2019ve been pretty cognizant of not wanting to go too big here and kind of not disrupt what you built there. But just give us a sense of what the needs are today? And what is the outlook for M&A in 2022?\nBob McMahon : Yes. Sure, Dan. So I\u2019ve used - been using this order the last several years of the build and buy growth strategy. So, we are still very interested on the buy element of fueling future growth and for example, in this past year, we did the Res Bio acquisition really got us into liquid biopsy and really allows us to play to our strengths that we already have from our CDx and IHC business.  So, we are going to look for continued opportunities such as those where you are in higher growth markets than the total company average, where they can really benefit by being part of Agilent and where they have differentiated technology and differentiated teams. We will stay in our lane, so to speak, on valuations. Let\u2019s - I\u2019d say, the - you know that\u2019s better than I do, perhaps, Dan. The market is still very robust. We are very active. And we just want to make sure that the deal works for our shareholders. But deploying capital for M&A is part of our story going forward and it\u2019s all upgrade.\nDan Brennan : Thanks, guys. Excellent. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Brennan. The next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. You may proceed.\nJack Meehan : Thanks. Good afternoon. Hey. I want to dig in a little bit more on Cell Analysis. So, heard cleared $100 million in the quarter. What was the 2021 contribution? And similar to the line of questioning on ASP, what\u2019s the target there for 2022 growth?\nBob McMahon : Yes. So, I\u2019ll start with the cell analysis business and I\u2019ll bring in Jacob here, because it has just done a fantastic job and it\u2019s really continued the momentum that we saw at the beginning - throughout 2020. So, it ended just short of $400 million for the full year and it grew in the mid-20s. And I would expect us to looking forward if we think about where the market is headed and the fundamental demand there, that will be growing double-digits for sure going forward. And as I mentioned before, the beauty of that business is, it\u2019s right ingrained with where the research and technologies are going and where a lot of money is being put in. But it\u2019s also an extremely well run and profitable business for us.\nMike McMullen : And Jacob, maybe you can give some insights in terms of where are the end-markets you think that are driving - been driving the growth and where we think it\u2019s going to come from in the future?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, thanks for that. It\u2019s a really good question. Obviously it\u2019s something I\u2019d really like talk about. The cell analysis business has been super successful in the past years and our focus on the immuno-oncology space has really paid off. We continue to see opportunities there and we continue to see that our portfolio of being able to measure live cells is required to really drive the research forward.  So where we really see the opportunities is, is in the - between biopharma and also the academic markets there, that\u2019s where we see the biggest and the biggest momentum going forward. While we have seen here in the past period of time also that the diagnostic business, particularly with our flow cytometry is picking up good speed, but, I would say, the main opportunity sits in the biopharma space.\nMike McMullen : And did you ask a question about NASD?\nJack Meehan : No.\nMike McMullen : Okay.\nJack Meehan : Can you down that line just from the comparison?\nMike McMullen : Okay. All right. You are right, Bob.\nJack Meehan : My follow-up was going to be, a lot of discussion obviously around driving growth. I was hoping to just get your philosophy on CapEx. So, I think the guidance implies about 4.5% of sales for 2022. That\u2019d be higher than you\u2019ve done in the last few years. Do you expect this is going to remain elevated more kind of in the medium-term? Or is this just kind of some of the near-term opportunities coming through?\nBob McMahon : Yes. Jack, that\u2019s a great question and what I would say is, if we look at where our there is different kinds of CapEx, and it\u2019s not all created equal. But the reason that it\u2019s being increased is really to fund that growth and capacity expansion, whether that be Train B and NASD or the capacity expansions in places like genomics and cell analysis and I would say, given our growth trajectory in those areas, I would expect us to continue at probably an elevated level to incorporate that growth. As Mike said, we\u2019ve got this buy and build strategy and that\u2019s part of the build strategy and it has paid off in spades with NASD. And what I would say is, we are not \u2013 there is more letters in the alphabet than B. It doesn\u2019t end at B. But what I would say is, there is - we are going to be prudent about it, but also be aggressive about going forward.\nJack Meehan : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Meehan. The last question is from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. You may proceed.\nCatherine Schulte : Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions.\nMike McMullen : Hey, Catherine.\nCatherine Schulte : First - first on the LSAG guide for mid-single-digits. I think on the last call, you talked about the GC replacement cycle coming back on, maybe being in the midst of an LC replacement cycle on small molecule. And you\u2019ll now have chemistries in there as well. So, should we think about this as being more towards upper-end of that mid-single-digit range for 2022 or was there some sort of catch-up spend in 2021 that maybe is a headwind as we get into 2022?\nBob McMahon : Yes. I think you\u2019re spot on, Catherine. It\u2019s the former, not the latter. Think about it as a higher end and that\u2019s where, I would say, if we think about where our opportunities for upside are, are in the instrumentation business and continuing the strong momentum that we\u2019ve seen. Now we are also going up against, I think, a 15% core growth rate year-on-year.  But we feel very good about the momentum in that business, particularly in the areas that you just talked about in Chemical and Energy and in Pharma. We continue to believe that the pharma business coming out of COVID is structurally a higher growth market and as we continue to place our focus on the biopharma or the large molecule, if you look at that throughout 2021, that was a much - growing much faster than the overall pharma business. And so, we would expect that - we feel very good about that business going forward.\nCatherine Schulte : Okay. And then, maybe one more, you had a lot of success on NASD. Do you have any interest in entering other areas as manufacturing components for biopharma, whether it\u2019s GMP reagents or DNA plasmas or other areas? And is that\u2019s something that you might get into in 2022?\nMike McMullen : Well, Catherine, we are always looking for new drivers of growth that would make sense for Agilent to be directly involved in. So, nothing to report for 2022. We\u2019ve got a handful of adding different additional letters, if you will to the all that we serve in NASD. But never say never to the thesis of your question.\nCatherine Schulte : Okay. Great. Thank you.\nMike McMullen : Quite welcome.\nOperator: Thank you, Ms. Schulte. And the last question is from the line of Noah Baron with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nTycho Peterson : Can you guys hear me?\nMike McMullen : Yes.\nBob McMahon : Hey, Tycho.\nTycho Peterson : It\u2019s Tycho. Sorry about the phone issues.\nMike McMullen : No problem. No problem at all. Sure.\nTycho Peterson : So, Dako, I appreciate the China color. Obviously people are focused on China tenders at the moment. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re flagging any issues there, specifically for Dako, but can you talk about what you\u2019re kind of seeing on the ground there for China? And then, how big is the CDx business?  You mentioned that earlier, Mike, and you obviously had a bunch of press releases during the quarter about new approvals for CDx? \nMike McMullen : Yes. So, Sam, I know this is something you\u2019ve been talking to your team about relative specifically about what maybe happened in the China diagnostics market and what\u2019s going on there. So, we think we\u2019ve got a pretty good protective position. But why don\u2019t you elaborate a bit more?\nSam Raha : Yes, happy to, Mike. Tycho, thanks for the question. We\u2019ve had another, just overall for our pathology business, the former Dako business, if you will, a really good quarter, including in China. And you may be referring, Tycho, to the buy China requirements that we are all aware of that are happening specifically to our former Dako business, if you will.  The relative unique position, particularly with PD-L1 and having a minimal number of local competitors really differentiates us. So, we haven\u2019t felt really pressure from the buy China impacting our business. But we have continued to see really good interest not only in PD-L1 companion diagnostics that brought more broadly speaking in China for our diagnostic products.\nMike McMullen : And Sam, if I recall, you\u2019ve got your PD-L1 registered in China, right?\nSam Raha : Yes, we do. I mean, we registered that almost exactly two years ago, becoming the first-ever companion diagnostic in China. And it\u2019s doing well for us there in China. We\u2019ve actually now trained over 400 different pathologists throughout China to utilize our companion diagnostics.\nMike McMullen : Yes. Hey, and Tycho, maybe just a follow-up, if I looked at our business in China for DGG for the year, it grew in the 30s, and it was actually in excess of that for Q4. So, it had very positive momentum and CDx is roughly $100 million, ex the Res Bio acquisition.\nTycho Peterson : Great. And then, on Cell Analysis, Mike, I know one of the priorities you\u2019ve talked about is moving that portfolio downstream. Can you talk about those efforts how actively you\u2019re looking at kind of pushing that into QA/QC and further downstream?\nMike McMullen : Yes. So, Jacob, why don\u2019t you follow-up with some thoughts here?\nJacob Thaysen: So, Tycho, when you said downstream, can you tell a little more?\nTycho Peterson : More in the bioproduction versus R&D, yes.\nJacob Thaysen: On the bioprocessing, yes, we see a big opportunity in the bioprocessing space, both for our Cell Analysis business, but also for our Analytical Instrument business. So, I think that\u2019s something we will continue to invest in going forward.\nBob McMahon : Yes. I think what we are seeing right now, Tycho, is moving from truly research into the development area. And then, that will then lead into the QA/QC. So, I think you see a multi-step process here and so, as Jacob said, it\u2019s just early days here from that standpoint. And - but making great progress across all three of those kind of sub-businesses and have high hopes for that to continue.\nMike McMullen : A similar flow that we\u2019ve seen in pharma for years, right, which is starting in our R&D then works its way into QA/QC. \nBob McMahon : Yes.\nMike McMullen : And, Tycho, I think we\u2019ve built this great business through a series of acquisitions and the way we integrate into it making one business. And this would be an area of obviously future focus for us on the M&A front, as well.\nTycho Peterson : Great. And just one last one on the new Agilent and I know you\u2019ve got a number of questions on the rollouts there.\nMike McMullen : Sure.\nTycho Peterson : Are there new services you\u2019re introducing in conjunction with that? Are you broadening the service portfolio?\nMike McMullen : Not yet, but stay tuned. It\u2019s only just a few weeks old.\nTycho Peterson : Fair enough. Alright. Thanks.\nMike McMullen : Okay. Thanks a lot, Tycho. Glad you get on the call.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Peterson. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. I would like to pass the conference back to Parmeet Ahuja for any closing remarks.\nParmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bethany, and thanks, everyone. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: That concludes the Agilent Technologies fourth quarter earnings conference call. I hope you all enjoy the rest of your day. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Yes. Hey. Thanks, Mike. In terms of Q4, whereas the revenue came in a little bit below expectations and that\u2019s driven in part by COVID-19 related delays in clinical trial enrollment. Overall, the interest that we are seeing both from our existing customers on the pharma side that we\u2019ve been doing I see work with, as well as new customers that\u2019s very, very real.  In fact, we\u2019ve now signed an agreement which is our first with a large existing customer giving evidence to the interest that\u2019s there in terms of the work that we are doing on the PMAs. These are approvals related to existing agreements with our Resolution Bioscience business. We are making good progress on that.  And so, lot of the momentum in a number of areas. So, very pleased to have them as part of our business to really bring together the strategy we\u2019ve had which is to be the companion diagnostic development and commercialization partner leveraging multiple modalities including immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing. Yes, happy to, Mike. Tycho, thanks for the question. We\u2019ve had another, just overall for our pathology business, the former Dako business, if you will, a really good quarter, including in China. And you may be referring, Tycho, to the buy China requirements that we are all aware of that are happening specifically to our former Dako business, if you will.  The relative unique position, particularly with PD-L1 and having a minimal number of local competitors really differentiates us. So, we haven\u2019t felt really pressure from the buy China impacting our business. But we have continued to see really good interest not only in PD-L1 companion diagnostics that brought more broadly speaking in China for our diagnostic products. Yes, we do. I mean, we registered that almost exactly two years ago, becoming the first-ever companion diagnostic in China. And it\u2019s doing well for us there in China. We\u2019ve actually now trained over 400 different pathologists throughout China to utilize our companion diagnostics."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks for that, Mike and I am sure that things got with now that you see the consumables product where it is, so we can truly build out end-to-end solutions that will really drive customer expectations and I think Padraig and the team have over the past few years in fact shown that the design end consumables can really drive a tremendous connect rates. So I think that already shown the path forward and now all being completely into LSAG, we can really accelerate that. Yes. Thanks, Mike. It\u2019s something to be proud of and I am \u2013 I feel really good where we are right now. As you said, we are growing very strongly. As I can see, when I look into the market, we are in a very strong position versus our competition also. And just a reminder, we - a few quarters ago, we did announced that we have expanded our Bio LC portfolio substantially. So we really have the full range of Bio LCs out there.  But we also have 2D-LCs and also online LCs to really drive growth in that area. So a Bio LC really came timely with all the investment that goes into large molecules right now. So I truly believe we have momentum and we\u2019ll continue with that over the next period of time. Yes. Certainly, Mike and as you mentioned, we had great success with our new Ion Mobility, 6560C that we launched here at ASMS and we had a fantastic worker and user meeting also that was rally all subscribed. But as you also speak to, we had tremendous traction on our triple core and single cord businesses.  And particularly in the biopharma space, we see a lot of smaller accounts also coming live, small mid-sized accounts that are starting to build up their capabilities within the analytical instruments business. So we see a lot of tremendous momentum there. But obviously, also the big accounts that is more in the refresh mode. Yes, thanks for that. It\u2019s a really good question. Obviously it\u2019s something I\u2019d really like talk about. The cell analysis business has been super successful in the past years and our focus on the immuno-oncology space has really paid off. We continue to see opportunities there and we continue to see that our portfolio of being able to measure live cells is required to really drive the research forward.  So where we really see the opportunities is, is in the - between biopharma and also the academic markets there, that\u2019s where we see the biggest and the biggest momentum going forward. While we have seen here in the past period of time also that the diagnostic business, particularly with our flow cytometry is picking up good speed, but, I would say, the main opportunity sits in the biopharma space. So, Tycho, when you said downstream, can you tell a little more? On the bioprocessing, yes, we see a big opportunity in the bioprocessing space, both for our Cell Analysis business, but also for our Analytical Instrument business. So, I think that\u2019s something we will continue to invest in going forward."

And also, I think accelerate execution of our digital ambitions for both delivering near-term growth and strategically invest for the future. So, very excited and already building on what is a great capability in the company. Yes. I think, yes, thanks, Mike. I think we see that it\u2019s a really mutual beneficial arrangement that we are going to see not only different customers, but at different spaces within customers and it also helps with overall the addressable market and coverage. So, the Agilent team and the Avantor team will be able to share leads and so on so we\u2019ll be able to cover the market better.

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. The Agilent team delivered another excellent quarter to close out an outstanding, record-setting 2021. At $6.32 billion for fiscal 2021, revenues are almost $1 billion higher than last year. Full year, core growth is up 15% on top of growing 1% last year. The strength is broad-based with our three business units all growing more than 10% core for the year. Our full year operating margins are up 200 basis points. Earnings per share of $4.34 are up 32%. Let\u2019s now take a closer look at our strong finish to 2021 and review Q4 results. Our momentum continues as orders increased faster than revenue in Q4 and at the same time, we delivered our fourth straight quarter of double-digit revenue growth.  At $1.66 billion, revenues are up 12% on a reported basis. Our core revenues grew 11%, exceeding our expectations. This is on top of 6% core growth last year. Our Q4 operating margin is 26.5%. This is up 160 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.21, up 23% year-over-year. Our earnings growth also exceeded our expectations. We continue to perform extremely well in pharma, our largest market growing 21%, driven by our biopharma business. Total pharma now represents 36% of our overall revenue. This compares to 31% of our revenues just two years ago. The strong growth in our chemical and energy business continues, as we delivered 11% growth in the quarter. This is on top of growing 3% in Q4 of last year. PMI numbers are positive and we expect that chemical and energy will continue its strong growth trajectory into fiscal 2022. In diagnostics and clinical, revenues grew 11% on top of growing 1% last year, as testing volumes started to recover.  On a geographic basis, our results were led by a strong performance in the Americas and China. Our business in the Americas grew 15% on top of 5% last year. China grew 8% core on top of strong 13% growth in Q4 of last year. China order growth outpaced revenue growth for the third quarter in a row. Now, looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $747 million. LSAG is up 11% on both a reported and a core basis. LSAG\u2019s growth was broad-based and led by strength in liquid chromatography and cell analysis. The pharma and chemical and energy markets were particularly strong for new instrument purchases. Our cell analysis business crossed the $100 million revenue mark in the quarter for the first time. During the quarter, the LSAG team announced a new Ion Mobility LC/Q-TOF and enhancements to our VWorks automation software suite. These new, well-received offerings are used to improve the analysis of proteins and peptides to speed development of new protein-based therapeutics. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $572 million. This is up a reported 10% and 9% core. Growth is broad-based driven by strength in service contracts and on-demand services, as well as for chemistries and supplies. Our focus on increasing connect rates continues to pay off for us.  The strong expansion of our installed base in 2021 and increasing connect rates bodes well for continued strength in our ACG business moving forward. Our ability to drive growth and leverage our scale produced operating margins of roughly 30%, up more than 200 basis points from the prior year. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $341 million, up 16% reported and up 13% core. Our NASD oligo business led the way with robust double-digit growth in the quarter and achieved full-year revenues exceeding $225 million. We expect another year of strong double-digit growth as the team continues to do a great job of increasing throughput with the existing capacity. The additional expansion of our \u201cTrain B\u201d oligo manufacturing facility in Frederick, Colorado is proceeding as planned. We expect this additional capacity to come online by the end of calendar year2022. Moving on from our other business group updates, there were several other significant developments for Agilent this quarter. We announced our commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We believe our approach delivers the same rigor to sustainability that we apply to everything else we do. We also believe these actions are not only the right thing to do, but fundamental to achieving long-term success. Our sustainability leadership continues to be prominently recognized, as well. You may have seen that Investors\u2019 Business Daily recently named Agilent to its Top 100 ESG Companies list. We are also a company where diversity and inclusion represent a company priority and is a core element of our culture. During the quarter, we achieved recognition by Forbes as one of the World\u2019s Best Employers, and as a Best Workplace for Women. While the Agilent team has a strong track record of delivering above market growth and leading customer satisfaction, we are always looking to do more. To further accelerate growth and strengthen our focus on customers, we are implementing a new One Agilent Commercial organization, combining, for the first-time, all customer-facing activities under one leader. The new organization brings together and strengthens our sales, marketing, digital channel, and services team. The new enterprise-level commercial organization is led by Padraig McDonnell. Padraig will continue to lead the Agilent CrossLab Group as Business Group President, as well as serve as Agilent\u2019s first-ever Chief Commercial Officer. The way I like to characterize this move is to say we are \u201cdoubling-down\u201d on the success we\u2019ve achieved with ACG applying a holistic, customer-focused approach to all aspects of our business.  We are also moving the Chemistries and Supplies Division to LSAG. This closer organizational alignment between instrument and chemistries development will further accelerate our progress on instrument connect rates for chemistries and consumables. We believe that \u201cstructure follows strategy\u201d and that this new organizational structure will further enhance our customer focus and the execution of our growth strategies. Looking ahead to the coming year, we are in a strong position to continue to deliver on our \u201cbuild and buy\u201d growth strategy. Agilent\u2019s business remains strong. We enter the New Year with a robust backlog and have multiple growth drivers, coupled with the proven execution excellence of the Agilent team. A year ago, during our Agilent Investor Day, we raised our long-term annual growth outlook to the 5% to 7% range, while reaffirming our commitment to annual operating margin improvement and double-digit EPS growth. We are now one year in and well on our way to achieving these long-term goals. Bob will provide more details, but for fiscal 2022 our initial full-year guide calls for core growth in a range of 5.5% to 7%. We expect to continue our top-line growth as we launch market-leading products and services, invest in fast-growing businesses, and deliver outstanding customer service.  My confidence in the unstoppable One Agilent team and our ability to execute and deliver remains firmly intact. This is our formula for delivering solid financial results, outstanding shareholder returns and continued strong growth. We are very pleased with our performance in 2021, but not satisfied. As I tell the Agilent team: The best is yet to come, for our customers, our team, and our shareholders.  Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Thanks, Vijay. Sure. Not at all. What I would say, the one big change is the business is doing even better than we had communicated at December of last year. So really appreciate the question. As you know, in my \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking about the new capacity coming online and that\u2019s still gone right per schedule, in fact, we distributed earlier last week and that\u2019s still to come on online by the end of calendar 2022.  But I think the team has just done a fabulous job, which is we are going to be able to grow double-digit in 2022 even without the new capacity, because they are able to continue to drive process improvements of broader book of business and larger batches. So the business is really on fire. I mean we are very, very happy with it. Yes. I have met Bob the other day, Vijay that a year ago we are talking about could we fill out the factory? Could it ramp and we\u2019ve blown right through that. No. No. You are welcome. Appreciate the feedback. Tycho? Tycho, I think you are on. Moving to the next in the queue. Hey, Brandon. Yes, when I talk about the \u2013 what we see is the potential upside in the guide and Bob, maybe you can talk about the \u2013 our China assumptions. And by the way, we are \u2013 hope we came through, so we are very happy with the momentum we have in China. I think the upside fits with our two largest end-markets, pharma and chemical energy.  And as Bob indicated in his script, we are assuming high-singles, I believe, Bob, for the pharma market really coming off just toward growth here in 2021. That high-level growth continues, that would represent upside in our biggest market. And we\u2019ve got a lot of early positive things happened in the pharma side of things. Pharma, let\u2019s say, C&E as well, right, Bob.  So we\u2019ve always \u2013 I think this is the most bullish language that I\u2019ve had in a call for sometime about the C&E. So you can imagine there has been even some caution about not over plan or too much. But I\u2019d say the two \u2013 our two largest end-markets represent the highest \u2013 where we think we may have some upside relative to our initial first guide for the year.  Bob, can you remind what we had assumed for China? Yes, no, thanks for that clarifying question. So, let me handle the second part of your question first, which is the ACG group will be 100% services in 2022 and then we are moving over the CSD, the chemistry and supplies portion of that business over to Jacob, for two reasons. One is, just the breadth of responsibility that product would have as we had made that change.  But we think that\u2019s going to be a driver of growth and I ask Jacob to make a comment on that here in a second, because I think they have these teams even closer together. We are going to be able to even further accelerate our connect rates on instruments for our chemistry products. Why the change? Hey, it\u2019s best to make, when things are going really well, it\u2019s really time to put down the hammer and really go as hard as you can and that\u2019s what we are doing here.  So, as you may know, when I first came in as CEO, I had five sales forces. I collapsed those into two. This is next evolution of that overall transformation of the company with this One Agilent culture behind it. The real belief is that the segmentation of our markets really calls for a much more of a customer orientation as opposed to product-centric view of how we want to sell and reach our customers.  And you think about the scale as you get with the digital platforms, digital infrastructure, our services organization, this makes sense to do this volume on top of your game. So, all things are going well, we thought it was really time to pit the seller down even further. And Jacob, you wouldn\u2019t mind just to comment to what you are thinking about your new responsibilities? Thanks, Brandon, appreciate the questions. Hey, Derik. Bob, do you want to take that? Hey, Derik, a follow-up on those two questions and so, and I have Sam coming on the second question. So, we\u2019ve not seen any real evidence of stocking on the consumables. So, I think that\u2019s pretty interesting, right, Bob? Yes. Yes. And then, what you are going to hear from Sam in a minute he will provide a little bit of color, we remain very, very bullish about the long-term prospects with ResBio and a lot of the work has been done to develop new opportunities with our pharma partners. But we are already on the short-term as well. Sam? Good afternoon, Dan. Yes. I think, what I would say is, first of all, I think our guidance is prudent given the beginning of the year. If we saw continued, greater than expected disruptions in the supply chain that may impact demand, particularly in some of the applied markets that could do it.  Although we haven\u2019t seen that, to be very clear, Dan. We feel very good about where we are given our forecast and backlog. So we are \u2013 I would say are, we have bias towards the upside in our forecast as opposed to bias towards the downside. Yes. It\u2019s a great question and the team continues to do a great job under Padraig\u2019s leadership here to do that both at the purchase and then on the ongoing aftermarket. What I would say is, right now, if you look at the overall attach rate, it\u2019s probably in the mid-20s right now. And if you look at the attach rates year-on-year, we saw very nice growth on the new placements.  So, all the new instruments that Jacob and team have been able to sell, that\u2019s why we feel very good about the ACG business going forward. So, we still have a long way to go there in terms of opportunity across both the services as well as the consumables. Some of our competitors are higher than that and so we\u2019ve got aspirations that are well above that mid 20s.  And Dan, I just like to make sure this clear, we are not making this change because we were dissatisfied with the improvements in that connect rates. This is icing on top of the cake before that accelerated as we look to balance span of control and business responsibilities with the real driver was the one commercial \u2013 creation of the one commercial organization.  And I think this is a nice secondary benefit that we are actually going to get, we think even more focus and header alignment between our product development groups on the CSD side and instrument side. You are welcome. Sure, Puneet. Yes. I think this is \u2013 let me start, Bob, you can jump in on this. So, I think when we talk about environmental and forensics, I think it\u2019s a tale of two cities. So, buried in that number is a decline in forensics and I think that\u2019s probably really tied to governments prioritizing other investments in this COVID-19 world.  The demand is not there. I think relative to China, it\u2019s been more about priorities. Right now, they are shifting some of their priorities towards the pharma and other COVID-19 related type investments. So, I think that\u2019s probably, I mean\u2026 Yes. Yes. Something\u2026 And thanks for jumping in on that, Bob, because we still are very, very confident about our ability to grow environment builds in China I think it\u2019s well known the government\u2019s real emphasis on continuing to make improvements in the quality of life of citizens. Yes, hey Jacob. I lead off on here and I mean, I first want to say is the key competitors in the LC market remain unchanged. Nobody new in the market and what I can tell you is that, we are very, very happy with where we are in liquid chromatography. So we are not playing any kind of catch-up game at all here. We delivered high-teens growth in the quarter and exited the year with record backlog and our growth rate in orders were significantly higher than our revenue growth rate.  And I think, Jacob, it\u2019s fair to say that the strength is both on the large and small molecule size with the real standout of China geographically. And I think you exited the year, but we see as record backlog. So we are really bullish on our LC business and maybe you want to have some additional comments? Thanks, Jacob. Hello, Patrick. It\u2019s accretive, right? Yes. Sure, Patrick. So, yes, so we are seeing really good end market demand for and I think Bob highlighted a lot of those like the advanced materials or chemicals. It really speaks to the overall recovery economically on a global basis and the fact that this in particular, this customer base had deferred a lot of investments for some period of time.  So, they are in a reinvestment mode and we have pretty good visibility to the funnel. So, I think we probably got at least a six month lead view on what\u2019s coming down on instrument purchases. So, we are feeling really good about the C&E business as well as there is the ACG story here as well of where we are continuing to increase services in this segment, which has historically been more of a self-maintainer kind of market, as well as the chemistries and consumables side.  So, I think we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility, given our confidence and be able to put this kind of number out there in a full year guide at this point in time. Bob, anything else you\u2019d add to that? I know we spend a lot of time talking about this. Well, I am going to pass it to Bob here in a second, but let me really clear in terms of our language. When I use supply chain, that means material constraints and then we have logistics. I think, of the issues that Bob, the transit times was really logistics issue. In terms of our ability to get product to customers and get the raw materials, we feel pretty good about what\u2019s been going on there so. I am going to \u2013 great question. I am going to pass that to our expert on this topic. Jacob, maybe you want to talk about what\u2019s going on in the LC/MS front. Yes. So, I think part of the story, Josh, is new customers, right, particularly on the biopharma side and also doing very well on the refresh side with existing customers. You are quite welcome. Hey, Paul. How are you doing? Yes. Hey, thanks for noticing that we had worked with Michael\u2019s team and have a real agreement we are really excited about. And I\u2019m actually going to pass it over to Agilent\u2019s new Commercial Officer to his view on that question. Go ahead, Padraig. And Paul, it\u2019s hard to put an exact percentage on the question. But we wouldn\u2019t be doing it if it was on the margin. Yes. Absolutely. All right, Dan. How about yourself? Right. Yes, thanks for that question. It was hard to explain it in the call narrative. But as Bob mentioned, our Q4 exit rate is higher than the full year number. I think it\u2019s a check for each one of the things you listed there. But the number one reason why we are doing is to drive more growth. And it\u2019s just a natural evolution of the transformation in the sales force. I started a number of years ago. And it really points to the fact that we have this broad-based portfolio that\u2019s selling into the same customer base.  And why have two separate sales forces and have to go do the coordination between across sales forces, and then the big push that we made over the last several years in terms of digital, this allow us, I believe, to even go faster on realizing our digital ambitions. And then you\u2019ve got the voice of the customer will be right in the CEO\u2019s staff and on Padraig\u2019s table, the Head of the service delivery organization. So, everything relative to the customer facing that we do in this company will be under one leader. We just think it\u2019s going to find ways to accelerate our growth, increase our customer satisfaction, and I think as we push more and more of our business because customers want to buy that way through digital, it will have a natural knock-on effect of efficiency gains in the P&L. And Jacob, maybe you can give some insights in terms of where are the end-markets you think that are driving - been driving the growth and where we think it\u2019s going to come from in the future? And did you ask a question about NASD? Okay. Okay. All right. You are right, Bob. Hey, Catherine. Well, Catherine, we are always looking for new drivers of growth that would make sense for Agilent to be directly involved in. So, nothing to report for 2022. We\u2019ve got a handful of adding different additional letters, if you will to the all that we serve in NASD. But never say never to the thesis of your question. Quite welcome. Yes. No problem. No problem at all. Sure. Yes. So, Sam, I know this is something you\u2019ve been talking to your team about relative specifically about what maybe happened in the China diagnostics market and what\u2019s going on there. So, we think we\u2019ve got a pretty good protective position. But why don\u2019t you elaborate a bit more? And Sam, if I recall, you\u2019ve got your PD-L1 registered in China, right? Yes. Hey, and Tycho, maybe just a follow-up, if I looked at our business in China for DGG for the year, it grew in the 30s, and it was actually in excess of that for Q4. So, it had very positive momentum and CDx is roughly $100 million, ex the Res Bio acquisition. Yes. So, Jacob, why don\u2019t you follow-up with some thoughts here? A similar flow that we\u2019ve seen in pharma for years, right, which is starting in our R&D then works its way into QA/QC. And, Tycho, I think we\u2019ve built this great business through a series of acquisitions and the way we integrate into it making one business. And this would be an area of obviously future focus for us on the M&A front, as well. Sure. Not yet, but stay tuned. It\u2019s only just a few weeks old. Okay. Thanks a lot, Tycho. Glad you get on the call."

I\u2019ll then finish up with our initial outlook for the upcoming year and for the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike mentioned, we had very strong results in the fourth quarter. Revenue was $1.66 billion, reflecting reported growth of 12%. Before I get into the details, I want to acknowledge our supply chain team, which has been doing a great job managing in a very challenging global environment. Core revenue growth at 11% was a point above our top end guidance range. Currency accounted for 0.8% of growth, while M&A contributed 0.5% of growth during Q4. And as expected, COVID-19 related revenues were roughly flat sequentially and resulted in just over a point headwind to the quarterly core growth. Late in the quarter, we did see transit times that were in certain cases greater than anticipated resulting in some revenues being deferred into Q1. Our results were driven by a continuation of outstanding momentum in pharma, and in biopharma in particular, while chemical and energy and diagnostics and clinical also delivered strong results for us. Our largest market, pharma grew 21% during the quarter against a tough compare of 12% last year. The small molecule segment delivered mid-teens growth, while large molecule grew 31%. Pharma was a standout all year, growing 24% for the full year after growing 6% in 2020. And in FY22, we expect our pharma business to grow in the high-single digits.  Chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 11% with instrument growth in the mid-teens during the quarter. This impressive performance was against a 3% increase last year. The C&E business grew 12% for the year, after declining 3% in 2020. Growth was driven by continued momentum in chemicals and engineered materials and we expect our C&E business to continue to grow solidly next year in the high-single-digits. Diagnostics and clinical grew 11% with all three groups growing nicely during the quarter. While the largest dollar contributor to this market is DGG driven by our pathology-related businesses, the LSAG business continues to penetrate the clinical market and drive growth with strong performances by cell analysis and mass spec.  We saw mid-teens growth in the Americas and strong growth in China, albeit off a small base. For the year, the diagnostics and clinical business grew 15% for the year after declining slightly by 1% in 2020. And we expect to continue to grow in the mid- to high-single-digits in 2022. Academia and government, which can be lumpy and represents less than 10% of our business was up 1% in Q4 versus a flat growth last year. Most research labs continue to remain open globally and increase capacity to pre-pandemic levels.  China came in at low-single-digits, while the Americas and Europe were roughly flat. For the year, we grew 7% after declining 4% last year. We expect this market will continue to improve slightly in fiscal year 2022 and expect growth of low to mid-single-digits. Food was flat during the quarter against a very tough 16% compare. Europe and the Americas grew while China declined. For the year, food grew 13% after growing 7% in 2020. Looking forward, we expect food to return to historical growth rates in the low-single-digits.  And rounding out the markets, environmental and forensics declined 2% in the fourth quarter, off a 5% decline last year, as growth in environmental was overshadowed by a decline in forensics. For the year, we grew 5% off a 2% decline in 2020.  And looking forward, like food, we expect environmental and forensics to grow in the low-single-digits in the coming year. For Agilent overall, on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in Q4 led by the Americas at 15%. China grew 8%, and Europe grew 4%. And for the year, Americas led the way with 21% growth, followed by China at 13% and Europe at 12%. Now let\u2019s turn to the rest of the P&L, fourth quarter gross margin was 55.9%, up 90 basis points from a year ago. Gross margin performance, along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in an operating margin for the fourth quarter of 26.5%, improving 160 basis points over last year. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.21, up 23% versus last year. And during the quarter, we benefitted from some additional tax savings resulting in a quarterly tax rate of 13% and our full-year tax rate was 14.25%. Our share count was 305 million shares, as expected. And for the year, EPS came in at $4.34, an increase of 32% from 2020. We continued our strong cash flow generation, resulting in $441 million for the quarter, an increase of 17% versus last year. For all of 2021, we generated almost $1.5 billion in operating cash and invested $188 million in capital expenditures. During the quarter, we returned $195 million to our shareholders paying out $59 million in dividends and repurchasing roughly 830,000 shares for $136 million. And for the year, we returned over a $1 billion to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases. And we ended the year with $1.5 billion in cash and $2.7 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 0.7. All in all, a great end to an outstanding year. Now let\u2019s move on to our outlook for the fiscal 2022. While we are still dealing with the pandemic and we have the additional challenges around logistics and inflationary pressures, we enter the year with strong backlog and momentum. For the full year, we are expecting revenue to range between $6.65 billion and $6.73 billion, representing reported growth of 5% to 6.5% and core growth of 5.5% to 7% consistent with our long range goals. And this incorporates absorbing roughly a half a point headwind associated with COVID-related revenues, with the majority of that impact coming in Q1. We are expecting all three of our businesses to grow, led by DGG. We expect DGG to grow high-single-digits with the continued contribution of NASD and cancer diagnostics. We expect ACG to grow at high-single-digits with both services and our chemistries and supplies businesses growing comparably, while LSAG is expected to grow in mid-single-digits. We expect operating margin expansion of 60 to 80 basis points for the year as we absorb the build out costs of Train B at our Frederick, Colorado NASD site. And in helping you build out your models, we are planning for a tax rate of 14.25%, consistent with current tax policies, and 305 million fully diluted shares outstanding. All this translates to a fiscal 2022 non-GAAP EPS expected to be between $4.76 to $4.86 per share resulting in double-digit growth. And finally, we expect operating cash flow of approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and capital expenditures of $300 million. This capital investment represents an increase over 2021 as we continue our focus on growth, bringing our NASD Train B expansion online and expanding consumables manufacturing capacity for our cell analysis and genomics businesses. We have also announced raising our dividend by 8% continuing an important streak of dividend increases and providing another source of value to our shareholders. Now, let\u2019s move on to our first quarter guidance, but before I get into the specifics, some additional context. Lunar New Year is February 1st this year, a shift from last year when it was in mid-February. As a result, we expect some Q1 revenue to shift to the second quarter this year as customers shut down ahead of the holiday.  In addition, as I mentioned, we do expect to see the largest impact of COVID-related revenue headwinds in the first quarter. We estimate these two factors will impact our base business growth by 2 to 3 points and are roughly equal in impact. For Q1, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.64 billion to $1.66 billion, representing reported and core growth of 5.9% to 7.2%. Adjusting for the timing of Lunar New Year and COVID-related headwinds, core growth would be roughly 8% to 10% in the quarter. First quarter 2022 non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.16 to $1.18.  And a couple additional points before opening the call for questions. In conjunction with new One Agilent Commercial organization Mike talked about, we will be reporting under the new structure starting in Q1.  In addition, we will be providing a recast of certain LSAG and ACG historical financials to account for the segment changes after the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K in December. I am extremely proud of what the Agilent team achieved in 2021 and look forward to another strong performance in 2022. With that, Parmeet, back to you for Q&A. Hey, Vijay, this is Bob. I did get the last part of your question, maybe. Yes, so, on the price, we do have built in roughly a point of price into our plan which is slightly higher than what we had this year, Vijay. And in terms of inclusion, we won\u2019t get into individual customer products, but what I would say is NASD is expecting another year of very strong growth. Yes. Vijay, if we looked at our order backlog, we are taking orders for 2023 already. Yes, Brandon, it\u2019s a good question on China and we continue to be very positive on China. If we look at our backlog, our order growth rate has increased higher than our revenue for the last three quarters. We exited 2021 with a record backlog going into 2022 for China. And our guidance comprehends high-single-digit growth in China. So, both being led by \u2013 from a geographic basis, growth will be led by Americas and China going forward. Yes. Yes. Thanks, Derik. It\u2019s a great question. And what we\u2019ve been able to do even in this last quarter in the phase of inflationary pressures is be able to drive pretty significant margin expansion across our businesses. And so, as we think about the 60 to 80 basis points to put kind of as perspective, we are anticipating roughly 15 basis point headwind associated with that train B build up and that\u2019s hiring the people and getting the product coming online and so forth.  And so, if we think about that, that\u2019s closer to 75 to close to that 100 basis points. A lot of that\u2019s going to come through SG&A operating leverage and the activities associated with just not growing our business expenses as fast as the top-line. And we are going to be looking to cover some of the inflationary pressures on the top-line with that price that I talked about before which we didn\u2019t really have any significant price in 2021.  We have started to see that. We took quick action earlier this year to reflect that and so a combination of it. Most if it being in OpEx leverage, but there will be some small operating leverage at the top-line as well, if you take out the \u2013 excuse me, at the gross margin, if you take out the NASD expenses as a result of covering our cost through pricing increases. That\u2019s great. Hey, Dan. Yes, the only thing I would add on that Mike is, there is some shift, but it\u2019s also timing. There are some\u2026 Yes, yes, there is some budget that we\u2019ve seen that has shifted into our fiscal first quarter and into FY 2022 in particular in China. I think long-term, we still see the importance of the environmental testing in China and around the world remains to be seen or is still intact, Puneet. And it\u2019s more a function of timing than anything. Yes. So, I would say, maybe on NASD, if I look at it and I break it into two components. If I look at it with the existing capacity, that team not only has driven top-line growth, but if we looked at the margin, it actually is accretive to the overall Agilent margin. So that team has done a fabulous job ramping up. Accretive, yes, very nicely. And so, we are making the investment on Train B. It\u2019s roughly 15 basis points. That\u2019s inclusive of that 60 to 80. So it\u2019s a roughly $10 million to $15 million of incremental cost associated with the training and investments as the lines come on board. And so, we are seeing that and take that to a side because those are kind of discrete. And if I look at the business, what we are seeing is the faster growing areas. We actually are seeing a benefit of mix. And so, we talked a little bit about cell analysis but also cell analysis in LSAG has been very accretive both on the gross margin, as well as the operating profit side. And so, we\u2019ve got these faster growing businesses that are helping with mix and then we are adding on the incremental price to cover the inflationary pressures that we are seeing and so forth.  But we\u2019ve also got productivity measures in place and this is where I think the One Agilent approach to our systems and our infrastructure really pays dividends, because we are able to leverage those costs across a larger base and because a lot of that is internal, we don\u2019t have that same level of pressure on cost as we are seeing in some other areas.  And so, it\u2019s a combination of product mix, that price. I talked about 1% price and then leverage in the operating expense side. No, I think you got it. You said it well. You are quite welcome. Sure, sure. Yes, exactly. So it was more just longer delivery times and Josh, it was in the LSAG business, as you would expect. It was roughly a point in the quarter. We are assuming that it will get better over the course of the first half of next year or first half of the fiscal year. So not all of it will come back in Q1. Yeah. And I was going to say, Paul, this is Bob. Just to add, I mean, we didn\u2019t really see any revenue. That\u2019s all future opportunity for us. And I think one of the areas that Avantor is strong is in the research area, Academia and Government, and this will help us even cover that market even broader than we do today. We did not, but what we did say is, we would expect strong double-digit growth. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Yes, what I can tell you is we exited at a run rate that was higher than the - if you took our $225 million that we talked about and divided by four, our runrate was higher than that. So we continue to ramp. Yes. In short, we are running 24/7 at both our Frederick facility, as well as our Boulder facility, which was a legacy facility. And we are \u2013 I feel very good about our ability to continue to expand capacity. What Brian and team have been able to do is increase both throughput, as well as yield. And so, that\u2019s really helped us drive additional capacity with the existing footprint or the existing manufacturing facility.  And the Train B, as we talked about has the opportunity to add more than $100 million of incremental volume coming online starting at the end of this - our fiscal - our calendar 2022. Yes. Sure, Dan. So I\u2019ve used - been using this order the last several years of the build and buy growth strategy. So, we are still very interested on the buy element of fueling future growth and for example, in this past year, we did the Res Bio acquisition really got us into liquid biopsy and really allows us to play to our strengths that we already have from our CDx and IHC business.  So, we are going to look for continued opportunities such as those where you are in higher growth markets than the total company average, where they can really benefit by being part of Agilent and where they have differentiated technology and differentiated teams. We will stay in our lane, so to speak, on valuations. Let\u2019s - I\u2019d say, the - you know that\u2019s better than I do, perhaps, Dan. The market is still very robust. We are very active. And we just want to make sure that the deal works for our shareholders. But deploying capital for M&A is part of our story going forward and it\u2019s all upgrade. Yes. So, I\u2019ll start with the cell analysis business and I\u2019ll bring in Jacob here, because it has just done a fantastic job and it\u2019s really continued the momentum that we saw at the beginning - throughout 2020. So, it ended just short of $400 million for the full year and it grew in the mid-20s. And I would expect us to looking forward if we think about where the market is headed and the fundamental demand there, that will be growing double-digits for sure going forward. And as I mentioned before, the beauty of that business is, it\u2019s right ingrained with where the research and technologies are going and where a lot of money is being put in. But it\u2019s also an extremely well run and profitable business for us. Yes. Jack, that\u2019s a great question and what I would say is, if we look at where our there is different kinds of CapEx, and it\u2019s not all created equal. But the reason that it\u2019s being increased is really to fund that growth and capacity expansion, whether that be Train B and NASD or the capacity expansions in places like genomics and cell analysis and I would say, given our growth trajectory in those areas, I would expect us to continue at probably an elevated level to incorporate that growth. As Mike said, we\u2019ve got this buy and build strategy and that\u2019s part of the build strategy and it has paid off in spades with NASD. And what I would say is, we are not \u2013 there is more letters in the alphabet than B. It doesn\u2019t end at B. But what I would say is, there is - we are going to be prudent about it, but also be aggressive about going forward. Yes. I think you\u2019re spot on, Catherine. It\u2019s the former, not the latter. Think about it as a higher end and that\u2019s where, I would say, if we think about where our opportunities for upside are, are in the instrumentation business and continuing the strong momentum that we\u2019ve seen. Now we are also going up against, I think, a 15% core growth rate year-on-year.  But we feel very good about the momentum in that business, particularly in the areas that you just talked about in Chemical and Energy and in Pharma. We continue to believe that the pharma business coming out of COVID is structurally a higher growth market and as we continue to place our focus on the biopharma or the large molecule, if you look at that throughout 2021, that was a much - growing much faster than the overall pharma business. And so, we would expect that - we feel very good about that business going forward. Hey, Tycho. Yes. I think what we are seeing right now, Tycho, is moving from truly research into the development area. And then, that will then lead into the QA/QC. So, I think you see a multi-step process here and so, as Jacob said, it\u2019s just early days here from that standpoint. And - but making great progress across all three of those kind of sub-businesses and have high hopes for that to continue. Yes."

And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Barney, and welcome to your first Agilent's earnings call as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. And thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Before covering our Third Quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge the recent passing of Dr. Tachi Yamada, a giant in our industry, and a former Agilent board member. Tachi was much more than a knowledgeable, deeply involved Agilent board member for nine years. As many of you on the call already know, Tachi lived a very full life as a doctor, a scientist, as a humanitarian who was driven to help others.  I know that the Agilent team is not alone in recognizing that Tachi Yamada will be greatly missed. And we extend our deepest sympathies to Tachi's family. Now, on the Third Quarter Review and our updated outlook for the year. In Q3, the very strong, broad-based momentum in our business continues. The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter, exceeding our expectations. Q3 revenue of 1.59 billion is up a reported 26% and is up 21% core. This is against a modest decline of 3% in Q3 of last year. So, we are well above the Fiscal Year 2019 pre-pandemic levels. In addition, like other positive signs of continued momentum, orders outpaced revenue during the quarter. Our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets, and geographies.  The combination of strong top-line performance and execution translated to excellent growth and profitability and earnings per share. Our Q3 operating margin is 26%. This is up 230 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.10, up 41% year-over-year. Agilent success continues to be driven by our build and buy growth strategy and execution prowess. We're developing market-leading products and services, investing in fast-growing businesses, while delivering outstanding customer service, and continue to drive profitability. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken actions to ensure Agilent emerges even stronger as a Company.  While we have yet to leave COVID -19 in the rearview mirror, our Q3 results are another indicator our actions are delivering the intended results. Bob will provide more details on end markets and geographies, But I want to briefly highlight our performance in our two largest end markets, Pharma and Chemical & Energy. We continue to perform extremely well in Pharma, our largest market, growing 27% with strength in both small and large molecule segments. Our large molecule business grew roughly 52% in the quarter and now represents 36% of our overall Pharma revenue, up from the mid-20s, just a few years ago.  In chemical energy, our business is recovering faster than expected, expanding 23% in the quarter. This is an acceleration of the momentum we achieved in the first half, and our order funnel continues to strengthen. Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science Applied Markets Group generated revenue of 680 million. LSAG is up 22% on a reported basis, this is up 18% core of just a 4% decline last year. LSAG 's growth is broad-based across all end markets. Our performance was led by strength in Pharma, which is up 22%, and chemical energy up 31%. All businesses delivered strong growth led by cell analysis at 38% growth, and our LC and LCMS businesses, which grew 22%. We continue to strengthen our position in the fast-growing Large Molecule market segment. During the quarter, the LSAG team launched 3 InfinityLab Bio - LC Systems at the well-attended InfinityLab LC Virtual Conference in June. These new products further extend our LC leadership position. In addition, building on our already strong Pharma offerings, we launched new compliance-ready LC/Q - TOF and LC - TOF solutions to our portfolio in the quarter. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted a revenue of 560 million.  This is up a reported 21% and up 15% on a core basis. These results are on top of 1% growth last year. The business is benefiting from increased activity in [Indiscernible] labs and instrument connect rates. This led to more contractive services, on-demand services, and consumables consumption across all end markets. All end markets grew mid-teens or higher, with exception of environmental [Indiscernible] which still grew 9%, The pandemic has shown ACG to be our most durable business with ACG growing each quarter since COVID-19 first emerged. Our customer-focused approach and digital investments continue to pay dividends.  Looking forward, instrument placements and demand as well, [Indiscernible] strong performance by ACG, as we drive attractive rates and increased costs for lifetime value. The diagnostic genomics group produced revenue of 346 million up 44% reported, and up 37% poor, compared to an 8% decline last year. The growth was broad-based across product lines and regions and was led by our NASD GMP Alago business. The ramp of our facility in Frederick, Colorado continues to go very well. The quarterly results exceeded our expectations, easily, surpassing the $50 million revenue milestone.  While one quarter does not make a trend, our team has done a tremendous job increasing output in a high-quality manner. This gives us increased confidence in our ability to exceed the $200 million annual run rate in revenue with existing capacity. In addition, the trained manufacturing line expense is well underway and on schedule. Our Genomics Instrumentation and Consumables businesses rebounded strongly in the quarter, as did our pathology-related businesses. For the first time in several quarters, we saw diagnostic testing above pre-pandemic levels. While we are watching the Delta variant very closely, to date, we have not seen a meaningful negative impact in testing volumes.  I also want to highlight our performance in China. While still less than 10% of DGG revenue, our China business grew 50% in the quarter. We continue to see tangible progress in building a stronger China market position. In Q3, we signed our first ever companion diagnostic development services agreement with a China-based BioPharma Company. Earlier this month, we also announced the initiation of in-country manufacturing for our SureSelect product line. We are very bullish about long-term growth prospects in China for our DGG Product and Services offerings. In addition, the integration of the Resolution Bioscience team is going well. And we are very pleased to enter and expand our participation in the fast-growing NGS-based cancer diagnostic market. It was a busy quarter at Agilent, so I have a few other achievements I'd like to share with you.  Last month we published Agilent's 21st Annual Corporate Social Responsibility report. At a time when some are just starting to look at issues like sustainability and societal impact, this has always been a key part of who we are as a Company. We've been addressing these issues since our founding more than 2 decades ago. I would encourage you to review our report on the Agilent website. We're also very pleased to receive recognition as a great place to work in the U.S. by the Great Place to Work Institute. This resulted from just one more example of us when having a highly engaged and energized team.  And as you know, teams with high engagement win in the market. Looking ahead, building on another excellent quarter and the momentum we're seeing, we expect the business to continue to perform well as we close out what we believe will be the outstanding fiscal year 2021. As a result, we are once again raising our full-year revenue and earnings guidance. Bob (ph) will share more details, but we're expecting a continuation of our excellent top-line growth and earnings generation.  While the world has yet to fully emerge from a global pandemic, Agilent is well-positioned to deliver excellent results again in the fourth quarter. I remain very proud of the Agilent team's ability to consistently deliver for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?\nBob McMahon: Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on Q3 revenue, and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike mentioned, we had an excellent result in the Third Quarter. Revenue was 1.59 billion, reflecting reported growth of 26%. Core revenue growth was 21%. Currency added, 4.5% for the quarter, and M&A added 0.5. In addition, COVID-related revenues were in line with the prior year.  All end markets performed well with Pharma and Chemical & Energy as standouts versus [Indiscernible] expectations. Our largest market Pharma, grew 27% during the quarter, after growing 2% last year. The performance was led by the continued strength in our large molecule business, growing 52%, while our Small Molecule business grew mid-teens. And all regions in the pharma market grew double-digits. Our Large Molecule business was driven by our NASD division and demand for LC and Mass Spec instrumentation and solutions. While our Small Molecule business was primarily driven by QA/QC refresh.  Chemical & Energy also performed well this quarter, with 23% growth. Even after accounting for the comparison against the 10% decline last year, this was clearly our best quarter since the onset of the pandemic. This result was driven by increasing momentum and demand for advanced materials and the general global economic growth. Our view is that the Chemical and Energy market still has additional room to grow moving forward. The diagnostics and clinical, we're very encouraged with the continued recovery in the market as our genomics and pathology businesses saw very good growth.  On a regional basis, all regions grew with China up 41% and America is delivering 38% growth. In academia, in the government market, we delivered 12% growth as most research labs continue to open globally and expand capacity. On a regional basis, Europe led the way. The Food market continued its double-digit performance, growing 12% on top of growing 1% last year. Food manufacturers continue to invest in increased testing to ensure quality and authenticity. A developing cannabis testing market, primarily in the U.S. also contributed to the growth in this market.  And regionally, the food market was led by the Americas and Europe. Rounding out our key markets, environmental and forensics came in with 5% growth. On a geographic basis, all regions demonstrated solid growth led by the Americas at 32% and Europe at 23%, both exceeding our expectations. The performance was broad-based across all markets. And as expected, China was up 8% on top of 11% growth last year. All 3 business groups grew in China during the quarter. Pharma, Chemical & Energy, and Diagnostics were the key drivers. Now, turning to the rest of the P&L. Third Quarter gross margin was 55.9% up 80 basis points from a year ago, despite roughly 40 basis points of headwind from currency.  Our strong top-line, some positive product mix, coupled with the strong execution from our operations team, drove the year-over-year improvement. And our supply chain team is doing a tremendous job getting our products to customers despite the increase in demand. Gross margin improvement in performance, along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in operating margin for the third quarter of 26%, improving 230 basis points over last year. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.10 up 41% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75% and the share count was 306 million shares as expected.  We delivered $334 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, showing a strong conversion from net income and up more than 15% from last year. During the quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends, and repurchasing roughly 800,000 shares for $113 million. Year-to-date, we've returned $829 million to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases, a leverage ratio of 0.8. Accounting for our Q3 performance and improved outlook in the fourth quarter, we are again raising our full-year projections for both revenue and earnings per share.  We are increasing our full-year revenue projection to a range of 6.29 to 6.32 billion, up to $125 million at the midpoint from previous guidance. and representing reported growth of 17.8% to 18.4%. in core growth of 14.5% to 15%. Included is roughly three points of impact from currency and a small amount from M&A. In addition, we're on track to deliver, roughly $100 million in COVID-related revenue in fiscal 2021, in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year and flat to last year. We expect to continue our strong operating leverage, and so we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $4.28 to $4.31 per share, up 30% to 31% for the year.  This translates to fourth-quarter revenue ranging from 1.63 billion to 1.66 billion. This represents reported growth of 10% to 12%, and core growth of 8.5% to 10%, on top of the 6% growth in Q4 of last year, when we started to see early signs of recovery from the strict lockdowns. In addition, while COVID revenue was roughly flat year-on-year for the full year, last year's fiscal fourth quarter represented the high-water mark in our COVID-related revenue. And as a result, we expect to see roughly a 1-point headwind due to COVID revenue in the quarter.  So, our core growth, excluding COVID, would be comparable to 9.5% to 11%. We are forecasting higher expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest to maintain our strong momentum, but expect continued operating leverage in excess of 100 basis points. non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between 1.15 and 1.18 with a growth of 17% to 20%. Now before opening the call for questions, I want to reiterate that we continue to see good demand in our end markets, have solid momentum in all our businesses, and expect to close the year extremely well. We believe our strategies are the right ones for Agilent, but we couldn't achieve these results, we [Indiscernible] without the excellent execution by the team. With that Barney (ph) back to you for Q&A.\nBarney: Thanks, Bob (ph). Paul (ph), if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.\nOperator: Definitely, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. However, if your question has been answered and you wish to remove yourself from the queue [Operator Instructions]. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter. Mike, I want to start with the --\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Tycho.\nTycho Peterson: -- China outlook. I know in China, there's been a fair amount of noise about companies being able to do products in-country -- [Indiscernible] shutdown -- internal shutdown. So, can you maybe just talk to some of the near-term dynamics in China? And it sounds like trade tension's also getting worse with the buy China policy. How do you think about that over the next couple of quarters?\nMike McMullen: Sure. Thanks for the congratulatory comments, Tycho, and we really, actually, continue to feel quite good about our performance in China, as Bob and I mentioned in the call script, I think 8% up on 11% last year, and I think our stack growth is around 19% Q2. It's actually up over our stack growth of 17 Q2. We're seeing this good, strong, Pharma and C&E demand in China. Now, the funnels really remain quite robust.  And I think, now getting to your specific question, we're not seeing any significant changes in terms of ability to get the product in. I mean, there's been a lot of noise for years, I have to say, between the U.S and China, yet the business seems to somehow get transacted. So, Bob, I think we're not really overly concerned about those dynamics. We did have somewhat of a little bit of shipment interruption as some of our Academia government customers were \u2013 had [Indiscernible] our VAP tax exemption change.  But I think that was a relatively minor impact on the P&L. But clearly, we're monitoring those developments and you have to continue to work to make sure you've got the logistics of flowing through the country, but we've always been able to find a way and are not overly concerned about it at this point.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I would say, Tycho. We continue to invest in China as we mentioned in the call. And there are always bumps here and there, but long-term we feel very good about the business in China.\nMike McMullen: Yes, that's having one other thought here, Tycho (ph.), is relative logistics. We have divested into a number of forward-looking stocking locations over the last few years, not really has paid us dividend, because we are less dependent on stuff coming directly into the port because we have a lot of in-country inventory.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then it sounds like you've got a lot of underlying momentum. I know you don't like to talk about the order book, but any preliminary comments you can make on '22 at this point, you know, Street has you are up about 6.5%, curious if you think that's a reasonable bar and any comments on where you think margins may go next year?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Thanks. Those specifics, but what I can tell you is that we feel really good about the momentum of the business, the order book is continuing to be strong and that's as of today, where we got the latest view of the early orders through August, so all the momentum remains there.  As I mentioned on our prior earnings call, we feel a really good ability to meet and exceed those long-term growth goals we put out, and the margin goals. I think that's where we stand right now, is we'll get to that in November, but we're feeling good about the trajectory of the business momentum we built here.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. Thanks a lot [Indiscernible]\nOperator: Your next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.\nBrandon Couillard: Many thanks. Good afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon, Brandon.\nBrandon Couillard: Maybe to start with the Biopharma business. I mean, 50% growth in Large Molecules is pretty impressive. Used to elaborate, given the sources of growth there, and what that would look like if you back out the NASD contribution.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Sure. And then I'm actually going to invite Bob and I will also want to have Jacob make a few comments on some of those new introductions here. I think I used the word broad-based, at least 5 or 6 times, maybe 10 times in my prepared remarks and we're seeing that in the biopharma.  So, we've got across the board, double-digit growth happening here. Cell Analysis LC, LCMS, other platforms that go into Biopharma, along with our consumables and services. And then to your point, really outstanding growth in NASD. But while NASD was a big contributor, it was an Agilent-wide life story. And Bob, maybe you can just answer the specifics on the numbers?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. And Brandon, to your point, the total in Large Molecules was 52% as I mentioned before. But even if you back out the NASD businesses still grew in excess of 40%. So very strong business on NASD, but it shows that the rest of the business, both instrumentations, as well as the consumables pieces and the other elements on the Pharma associated revenue in Diagnostics and Genomics also, very strong business in it.\nMike McMullen: And Brandon (ph.), I just wanted to maybe have Jacob (ph.) jump in very quickly because we have a continued drumbeat of new introductions into this space as well, which has been the focus and prioritization of our R&D pipeline. Jacob (ph.), I know we had 2 big introductions in Q3 as well.\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, thanks for that, Mike (ph.). And that's -- you know, at the analyst said, I think we've talked about in [Indiscernible] that about 70% of our portfolio above that was really focused on Biopharma a so I'm really happy to see that momentum we have right now. And as you also mentioned in the prepared remarks, you know, I'm very pleased with the bio-LC portfolio. In fact, we had and -- and, one of the [Indiscernible] of our momentum is that with that Bio-LC that we introduced here a few months ago.  And we had a virtual conference with more than 1,000 customers participating, and we had more than 25 external scientific speakers, which I would actually say I know it's the best in history by far. So that introduction is actually creating quite a lot of momentum and it allows us to play for all the [Indiscernible] biocompatible space to the 2D-LC, but clearly, also into the Mass Spec, with the Mass Spec at the end of it. And we also mentioned compliance. The FDA [Indiscernible] informatics compliances and all that very important part that most of the Biopharma see as the requirement to do business with them.  And we have invested in this for quite a while, so we ensure that data integrity, audit readiness, and storage of data is the level of security. And right now, we have the offering both supporting our LC, but also all our major marketable Mass Spec instruments. And also, in spectroscopy, with the recent announcement here off the top in the Q2 informatics solutions. So right now, we are -- we have a very strong portfolio and that truly drives our growth. Well, I can continue talking about the cell analysis, but I will --\nMike McMullen: I'm going to bounce it back to Brandon. Hey Brandon, thanks for allowing us to do an advertisement on the Agilent portfolio strength. But, back do you. Do you have any additional questions?\nBrandon Couillard: Yeah, I think just touched on maybe if we could just elaborate on the Small Molecule market. You mentioned QA/QC refresh, curious [Indiscernible] we might be in there and what you think the market is kind of growing for Small Molecule relative to your big team.\nMike McMullen: It's our view that there is always a replacement market going on in the Small Molecule space, and sometimes, it picks up a bit more. But then -- and I think we're in that phase right now. I wouldn't say it's a huge acceleration, it's just the solid and probably high changes.\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, I was going to say, Brandon as we think about this prior to the pandemic, we were probably slower growth than normal were some of the QA, QC refresh was probably elongated. And now we're starting to see that pick back up, and that typically is an 18 to 24 months kind of cycle. And I would say we're still at the beginning of that. And so, feel good about the continued performance of the refresh cycle going forward.\nBrandon Couillard: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, congrats on the strong print this afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: Mike, maybe on my first question here, Resolution Bio, that deal that you guys did, did that come in line with expectations? I'm just curious. The 50-basis points contribution seems a little light. Is there some ramp-up phase here that's in log and not? Maybe just talk about what the deal does to you and how it adds to the corporate growth rates here.\nMike McMullen: So, you do some very good math. So, it's about half-a-point of reported growth rate, Bob. And I'd say relative to Q3, probably a little bit behind the revenue as we learn more about this business or some elements of this global lumpiness, so we're feeling pretty good about how our business will finish, but we're expecting a lot in the Fourth Quarter. I think this is a story of continued acceleration of growth in '22 and beyond and we're just super delighted by the early days of how the teams feel about being part of Agilent.  And then we're really building scale around this business. So, I think it's still a relatively small part of the overall revenue picture today for Agilent, and we knew that going in, I think is roughly [Indiscernible] million, but we would expect really strong growth rates in the coming years and again, we really feel like we're off to a great start with this team.  Just interacting with Mark Li, who is the founder -- co-founder of Resolution Bio. He is really happy about the capabilities that we're bringing to his business to further scale it. So early days, but feeling good -- pretty good about things and [Indiscernible] I don't know if you're saying [Indiscernible]\nBob McMahon: Yeah, I was just going to say the other thing is, obviously, we're just now having more and more conversations with our existing CDx customers and the power of being able to have our established CDx business on the [Indiscernible] side coupled with NGS-based technology, I think is going to be a real significant competitive advantage for us going forward. So very excited about this business going forward.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Mike. And Bob, one for you on expenses. In the year-to-date operating expense as a percentage of revenues, you guys [Indiscernible] a low 30s sub 31%, that's well below your historical level. I guess my question is, is this all just associated with the volume leverage rate given the strong organic performance year-to-date, or are there some timing elements on expenses, that [Indiscernible], and how should we -- if there are how should we think about those factors coming back in '22?\nBob McMahon: Yeah, Vijay, it's a great question. And I think if you remember, maybe a year ago we talked about some of these expenses that were going down, and our goal was not to have them come back to the same levels that they had. And these would be in areas around travel, but also leveraging our digital capabilities, and what we've been able to do is be very successful. Certainly, volume is our friend. And the leverage that we've been able to drive across all three of our business groups has really helped.  But if you look at our year-over-year elements around travel and costs associated with marketing programs and digital investments. Our digitals investments have gone up, but the actual return on those investments has actually gone up. And in fact, Jacob just highlighted one of the programs that we had. And so those are -- our goals are for those to continue -- they will continue to ramp next year to come back, but not near the level that they had come prior to the pandemic.  So, we do think that there's a fundamental margin improvement associated with these expenses. And that's why Mike talked about our long-term margin expansion story is intact. It's not going to be 200+ basis points like it were this last quarter, but certainly feel good about our continued ability to drive margin expansion.\nMike McMullen: And Vijay (ph.), this is Mike, if I can just add one additional comment too, and I hopefully came out in my prepared remarks, but we're not holding back on investing for growth. So, we're quite pleased with the margin performance, but it didn't come at the expense of our ability to grow down the road.\nVijay Kumar: That's extremely helpful, Mike (ph.). Congrats again. Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Could I -- actually could I just build off of that last question with a quick follow-up. Again, acknowledging and recognizing you're not going to guide on 2022 today. I'm just wondering though at high levels, should we assume that incremental margin is going to be a little bit lower than normal next year? If we're assuming a normalization of activity in the post-pandemic world? I heard what you said about areas where you're not going to need to invest as much, but at the same time, you are investing in growth. Just mathematically, does the incremental need to be a little bit lower than normal next year?\nMike McMullen: Yes. We're still building our plan. But our intent is to still be able to drive that margin expansion. I will say that we are having our new Train B in NASD come online, which will add a little pressure to it. But, I think, we've been very good about being able to do 30% to 40% incremental and sometimes even higher than that when the margin comes in. And I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to do that, Doug.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay, super helpful.\nBob McMahon: Maybe what's -- yes, maybe what's underlying your question is inflationary pressures and activities around that I would say that we didn't see any material impact. Obviously, there is some but we're planning to manage that going forward.\nDoug Schenkel: Yeah, that's in audits. It's supply constraints, it's inflation or refreshers. It's the hope that we're traveling a little bit more and there are real conferences and real site visits, things like that. So that's the spirit of the question. Just making sure that the capture of those dynamics, we don't have to think about something other than that 30 to 40 traditional [Indiscernible] range. So that's helpful, Bob (ph.).\nMike McMullen: I would just add. [Indiscernible] we're under 22 now. Sorry to interrupt there, but I'd just say that some of our programs, and -- and such are really geared towards making sure we can manage our way through this in '22, so we're on this already.\nDoug Schenkel: Got it. Okay. In terms of full-year guidance, as it's been noted a few times, you increased the outlook by more than the magnitude of the Q3 B. I guess I'm just wondering what gives you confidence in this change. Is it backlog data? Is it pacing across the quarter? Is it activity through the first month of the quarter? Maybe it's all the above and maybe more importantly --\nMike McMullen: [Indiscernible]\nDoug Schenkel: You just checked everyone? Okay. Perfect.\nMike McMullen: I know. Bob and I are smiling in the room here, and, I think, we can probably put a checkmark on all -- first of those 3 things you mentioned.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. And then throughout the year, you've consistently beaten your own targets pretty maturely, and it definitely makes sense to skew the error bars a bit more conservatively when you set your targets, given the state of the world. That said, given how well you performed relative to those targets, and recognizing we're not out of the pandemic, but we've got a little more experience with it at this point. Is it fair to say that you're at the point where you could adjust the philosophy a little bit and maybe change the positioning of those error bars as you set guidance moving ahead?\nMike McMullen: Yeah, I think that that's fair. I think -- what we've tried to do is set prudent guidance as we've talked about in the past. But certainly, as we've and our customers, more importantly, the market is getting used to dealing in a COVID world, there are fewer variables to be able to understand. And I would look at just what we did in Q2 to Q3, we dramatically increased our Q3 guidance and then did the same thing here for Q4. So, I think our visibility is improving. You should take that away for all the things so you rattled off. Certainly,\nBob McMahon: the momentum that we're seeing, the general economic improvements, and so forth. But as you mentioned, there's still a Delta variant out there, and so well, as Mike mentioned, we haven't seen any impact of that yet. We also recognize that that could change during the course of the quarter. So, we're trying to take all those factors into account, but also try to provide some realistic guidance going forward.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Thanks again, guys.\nBob McMahon: You're welcome, Doug.\nOperator: Your next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik de Bruin: Hello, and good afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Hey, Derik.\nDerik de Bruin: Hey. Can we talk a little about environmental and [Indiscernible] and I wanted Doug to tell that question too? I know it's probably a little bit early, but any signs of how we should think about the GC portfolio picking up, or you just replaced -- is it just sort of like catch-up spending right now in the industrial or any initial indications that the replacement cycle that you were going -- you were in the midst of prior to the pandemic is likely to restart.\nMike McMullen: Hey, Derik. Hey, how do I take the first one in Bob -- I mean, Bob and Jacob, you may want to add additional comments here. But let me talk about the question around gas chromatography. We are seeing that.  And that's really behind a lot of the fairly bullish comments, if you will, around C&E space. So, we're seeing it in our GC revenue, and we're also seeing it in our GC order book. And I've been very reluctant to call that hey, we think this business is now in a situation of returning to growth.  That reluctance has now passed. I think we're now into what looks to be the start of some really good potential business on our GC side, as that replacement cycle turns back on. And Jacob, I know you're a lot closer to the detail\u2019s alignments, anything else you could add to that?\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah, Mike (ph.). You're absolutely right. I think first of all of them -- I think Bob (ph.) mentioned that also the chemicals and engineered materials market certainly on fire right now, [Indiscernible] in Semicon and in the mining industry, including lease term for batteries.  But we also see the traditional Petrochem markets really start to see some momentum now. And there's a lot of talk about the future of Petrochem but this market is going to pay for quite along. And I think that all the analysis shows that there'll be [Indiscernible], so we see investments coming into this market right now. And the new market that's also coming along is Renewable Energy, which will also use many of our technologies.  And we see a great opportunity there also in the future. They're still in a development phase, but as you know, there's a lot of investments going in here, so we are participating in that also. So, we see a lot of opportunities in GC and the GC is actually seeing momentum both first in the chemical markets, but now into the energy markets.\nDerik de Bruin: Okay, so following up on that. So, you're feeling good about your more industrial [Indiscernible] experiments, even with some of the choppiness in the Chinese market, the data there. So, are you seeing -- is it the U.S. and Europe [Indiscernible] anymore or is it just that you're seeing turn on that one? And then where were we -- what remind me in annoying baseball analogies where we were in [Indiscernible] on the GC replacement cycle?\nBob McMahon: Yes. So, Bob, I think it's fair to say that there really is no difference across the regions. I mean, China actually was the area of strength for us in C&E, and I think we're seeing good -- good strength globally, which I think points to the importance of global economic outlook for this segment. And I'd say we're probably earlier middle innings on the -- paused there for a while because we got rate run going with the new portfolio, but a pause. I'd say we're early innings, middle innings.\nMike McMullen: Yeah. I would say too, Derik, just to give you a frame, China was more than twice the -- China C&E market was in line with the overall C&E growth rate that we saw.\nDerik de Bruin: Thanks for answering the question.\nOperator: Your next question is from Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. And good afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon.\nDan Leonard: I was hoping you could -- Mike (ph.), I was hoping you could address the 5% to 7% core revenue growth model that you've introduced in December. Is that still relevant? Do you think something has fundamentally changed in the markets from that time period?\nMike McMullen: I'd say it's relevant till we change it. So, I'm not ready to, on the fly here, revise our long-term growth. But as you may recall, in our December outlook, we said, think about us being more of the high range in that area. And I think [Indiscernible] a little tougher so I put a 7 out there in any type of long-term growth guidance. I think what's changing is the nature of our portfolio, which is we continue to build very quickly, much bigger positions in faster-growing segments. And I think it's probably fair to say that the Pharma market, in particular, the Biopharma market is -- remains very robust, but again, we're sticking with those long-term growth goals at this point in time.\nBob McMahon: I would say, Dan, to build on what Mike is saying, particularly the pharma market. We do feel that that market, and in fact, Mike talked about it in his prepared remarks that we're emerging as a stronger Company. We do think that the Pharma market, really driven by that Large Molecule area, is a faster-growing market coming out of the pandemic than going into it.  And I think if we look at where our investments are and the performance that we've had in particularly the Large Molecule. Now again, Small Molecule has been doing very well. That, in and of itself, would elevate that overall long-term growth rate to be faster than what we saw going in, which certainly helps us, given that is -- that's our largest market. So, I'll leave it at that.\nDan Leonard: Okay. That's a helpful clarification. And just a follow-up on China, could you elaborate further on the drivers of that 50% growth rate you called out for DGG in China?\nMike McMullen: Yes, I'm going to invite Sam on this call. He hasn't had a chance to work today in this call. So, Sam, your thoughts of what's been going on in China, I was doing a little bragging on your growth rate there.\nSam Raha: Yeah. Mike, happy to give more perspective on China. We actually had a good quarter across the board for all of our business groups within DGG. Specifically, we continue to see real momentum in clinical diagnostic testing, led in pathology.  We've seen really good pick up of our PD - L1, and our diagnostic -- or companion diagnostic there, as we've continued to train more pathologists there in the use and so forth. Genomics also had a really, really, good quarter, both on the consumable side. And we've also just recently announced within the quarter, the launch of our new V8 Xome, which is being well received in China and globally.  And I will tell you one of our absolute strengths in China as it is elsewhere, remain our core NGS and Genomics QC portfolio. So, all of those elements, along with Mike, as you mentioned now, the signing of our first companion diagnostic development agreement with the Biopharma there, I think foretell a continued story of strength in China for DGG.\nMike McMullen: And just to build on Sam's comments, I mean, we've been working really hard the last several years putting in the right foundational capabilities, building the right commercial channel, the right ability to handle diagnostics products ourselves, and it's really great to actually see those investment starting to pay off in year term growth.\nDan Leonard: Appreciate all that color. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Your next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, thanks for taking the question, guys.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nPatrick Donnelly: Mike, maybe one on the Chemical & Energy side to follow up on some of the earlier questions. I know that's one where you pretty closely keep an eye on the order book and your confidence goes with that. Are you getting more visibility as the order book builds there? I'm just trying to compare it to pre-pandemic mid-pandemic, I know you guys had a pretty short leash on in terms of how you would guide for that segment, how comfortable you would allow yourselves to get. Just wondering how the order book is looking there relative to some of the past quarters and how you're feeling about that segment. Certainly, seems like the tone is pretty positive here.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Now I'm glad you picked up on that. We really want that to come through in the call. And I think the confidence is coming from not only the revenues that we've reported, but as Bob (ph.) mentioned in general, and I think it also holds for C&E, we just have much better visibility into our funnel. And you may have recalled I was talking a lot of -- in prior calls, I talk a lot about a conversation we're having with customers and we knew there was activity.  But now that conversation is turning into orders. So, we're feeling much better about the trajectory of the C&E space. Historically I've been very cautious to give any real kind of positive trends in this area. But I think we've seen enough over the last few quarters and what we're seeing with our customers and the order book is really the basis for this confidence.  And again, it's tied to not only the pent-up demand they've had in terms of even replacing aged equipment in their laboratories, but they are also -- what we hear from our customers, there are much more confident about where the global economy is going.  So, they're willing to make investments. A couple of positives here and there and there will be some ups and downs because of outbreaks here and there of COVID, but in general, the [Indiscernible] remains very positive, I think as Bob mentioned earlier, our customers have learned to deal with this. So, Bob, I know this is -- we've talked a lot about this, anything I missed there?\nBob McMahon: No.\nMike McMullen: Okay.\nPatrick Donnelly: That's helpful. I appreciate it, Mike. And then on the diagnostic side and just given commentary that you guys are above pre-pandemic levels, can you just talk about the pace of the recovery in the quarter and then expectations for the further ramp from here. And I just want to clarify and make sure you haven't seen any impact in Delta up until I guess this week. I just want to make sure I have that clear. Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. I mean, we saw continued recovery. I think we mentioned at the beginning -- at the end of Q2 that we were at pre-pandemic. We exited there. The average was still below. And that steady improvement across our business, across really across all of the regions continued into Q3. And by the end of Q3, we were above. And Patrick, to your specific question about Delta, we have not seen any impact to date associated with that.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great. Thanks, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question is from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt Sykes: Hello. Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions, congrats on the quarter.\nBob McMahon: Sure.\nMike McMullen: Thank you.\nMatt Sykes: Just on ACG, you guys had a pretty impressive operating margin, over 29% for the quarter. I'm just wondering what you feel about the sustainability of those margins and then any progress that you've made on attachment rates in that business? I know you mentioned a little bit in your prepared remarks, but any additional color on that would be helpful.\nMike McMullen: I think I'll pass it on to Borick (ph.), who can provide some additional color to the ACG and answer your questions. Go ahead, Borick.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Great. Thanks -- thanks, Mike. And we're getting back to more normalized service support with our customers, which is more cost associated, of course, with travel, but we're starting to see an accretive margin in Q3 and we're seeing that come through to improve in Q4. So very, very strong in that. In terms of touch rate, we're seeing increased touch on our services and consumables and of course, with the larger install base, this bodes really well for the future, as more attach rates for services and consumers will be available to a very strong outlook.\nMike McMullen: Yes, hey, and Matt, maybe just to build on what Borick(ph.) is saying in terms of sustainability, we feel very good about the ability to continue to sustain those levels of margin. It gets back to the work that our service engineers do in servicing our customers. It's mission-critical for our customers, keeping those labs and those instruments up. And our ability to continue to invest in digital, as well as, be there on-site on the labs or with the labs is really important.  A one piece that I would add is we continue to invest in that digital as I mentioned before, and our online orders actually grew faster -- our revenue grew faster than the overall ACG business, which actually speaks to our continued relevance in that space. And obviously, that's good for our customers in terms of either doing business with Agilent, but it also helps from that margin perspective as well.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks for that color, it's very helpful. And then just one more on C&E. I know you've answered a lot of questions already, but I'm just wondering how the competitive landscape might have changed. Obviously, it had a challenging time during COVID. It took a while for it to recover, and now, it's certainly in recovery mode. I'm just wondering, as you look out of the competitive landscape, have you seen some competitor's slow investment; and therefore, there are some share gain opportunities in that growth that you're seeing?\nMike McMullen: I don't know where they slowed. I'm not sure they're investing for that segment. So, and we're not seeing much happen on the competitive side. We're by far this is -- we're the clear leader in this space, we've continued to invest in our core portfolio pre and throughout the pandemic. So, as you can tell, I'm pretty bullish about our ability to outgrow the competition in this space.\nBob McMahon: Yeah, let me add. It seems like a long time ago, but we launched 2 new GCs back in 2019, both at the high end and a mid-range GC. And we talked about one of the reasons that we did that is we've got a leadership position in the GC market. But when you look at it, we're over-index to the high-end, and so the ability for us to be able to have this mid -- mid-range, I think was really critical, and we're starting to see that benefit. And maybe Jacob wants to jump in that conversation. Yeah.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Exactly. You're actually right on the GT and our strength in our GT, but I think we should also mention our spectroscopy business and the ITPMS, where we have done a lot of work also ITP, OES, and MS, where you're doing a lot of work that is -- that has a very strong market share for the material science. And we continue to take market share in that space also. So, I think you'll see us being very strong here. And we have also a site that we will continue to invest in this market going forward. So that's [Indiscernible] therefore the costumers going forward.\nMatt Sykes: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Joshua Waldman with Cleveland Research, your line is open.\nJoshua Waldman: Hi, thanks for taking my questions, just two for you. Mike, you mentioned overall orders outpaced sales in the quarter, and it sounds like book-to-bill in the LSAG business was slightly positive. Just wondered if you could provide us with your assumptions for core growth in the LSAG business in the fourth quarter.  And then as we look beyond FY21, given the broad-based strength you've spoken about on the call today, I guess, is it fair to assume that as we look to FY '22, this business should likely grow something above a low to mid-single-digit longer-term average?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. Let me talk about the fourth quarter and I'm not sure we're going to answer the last one just yet as we're going through our plan, but --.\nJoshua Waldman: I had to try.\nMike McMullen: Yes, yes, that was a good try. But I would say for Q4, you're accurate in the belief that our book-to-bill was positive for the quarter, and if you think about Q4, our guidance comprehends high single-digit, low double-digit growth for the LSAG business core growth. And so, I'll leave it at that.\nJoshua Waldman: Got it. And then it seems like here today, Pharma has outperformed what you expected coming into the year. I just wondered if you could comment on any current thoughts you have around the potential magnitude of any year-end budget flush, I guess, given -- it seems like investments from these customers have -- have been fairly consistent -- consistent, and strong throughout the year. Does that deflate any year-end spending?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. We'll address that in the Q1 call. But to your point, we've been pleasantly surprised, and it has continued to be stronger than what we've anticipated throughout the first 3 quarters, and what I would say is we don't expect that to slow down any in Q4 either.\nJoshua Waldman: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And your last question is from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thanks. Good afternoon. You talked about the job that your team is doing, managing the supply chain. Was wondering if you can elaborate on a hotspot you're seeing in terms of inputs, shipping, or labor. And when you look at the fourth-quarter guidance, is that -- are you taking any more prudent or conservative type approach based on what's going on in the supply chains?\nMike McMullen: Yes, I mean, this has been a lot of discussion on that. I think everybody is talking about the supply chain constraints on a global basis. It's been a challenge for us, but as Bob noted in this call script, our team has just done a tremendous job getting the Agilent products to our customers. And we're really good at this about managing situations.  So, we will work on a number of commodity areas for some time. And we also have done things as identifying a changing alternatives source, supply. So, we've been able to do that. We've had a last-minute changes notification from logistics suppliers that they won't pick up our boxes, and so we switched to another supplier.  So, we've been able to manage our way through that. And it was conspicuous, it was absent in our cost script a lot of details because while we continue to monitor it, we don't believe that's a material risk to the Company at this time, and we still likely -- we factored all that into our guide for the fourth quarter. And Bob (ph.), I know that you've done a close study of this as well, anything else you'd add to that?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. The only thing I would say is it's the usual suspects that other folks have called out, things like [Indiscernible] and our team has done, to date, an outstanding job of being able to continue to satisfy demand here.  And our expectation is that that's going to continue to happen into Q4. And we've got a continuous improvement program that continues to drive productivity and efficiency gains. And we're expecting that, and to combat some of these inflationary pressures as well as continuing to deliver to our customers. And we will continue to do that into '22 as well.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then one other follow-up is on COVID.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nJack Meehan: So, the fourth-quarter guidance assumes it's a 1-point headwind, though we're obviously in the middle of another Delta wave here. So, I was curious what you're seeing on the ground or whether your products are just starting to wane in general and any preliminary thoughts around how, you have 100 million this year, just how you're going to guide as you go into 2022 related to that?\nBob McMahon: What I would say, Jack, it's a good question, and our products aren't directly tied to the testing. We didn't see the dramatic increase but also didn't see the dramatic decline with the testing there. Ours is more around expanding capacity both in testing and over the course of this last year. We've actually seen it migrate to more therapeutic capacity or excuse me, vaccine capacity in demand there.  And so, we don't see it spiking up or not building that into Q4. I think it's a little too early to tell for -- for FY22. It's been -- it's been reasonably steady the last couple of quarters. And we do expect contribution in '22 and we'll provide more color as we get through our planning process, but we don't see it dramatically dropping off.\nJack Meehan: Sounds good. Thanks, Bob (ph.).\nOperator: I do apologize but we do have an additional question. The last question is from Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDan Arias: Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for getting me in here at the end. Hi, Mike?\nMike McMullen: Sure. No problems.\nDan Arias: Just one for me. Just Bob, maybe a high-level question. Just to the idea of getting to a post-COVID world, whenever that might be. I'm wondering which of the 3 segments you think might stand the best chance of maybe rebasing at a higher level of the up-margin line, just by virtue of some of the success that you're having, and then to your point, some of the fundamental changes that might come to the expense structure. Is that something you think is possible? And if so, would you be willing to help us with which one is looking most promising there?\nMike McMullen: I do think it's possible. I'm not going to call out because I'm not going to let -- if I call out one, I'm not going to let the other two Division Presidents off the hook. They must have paid you. I think we could continue to do it across the board.  Certainly, we are making investments across all three of the businesses to continue to grow. But we certainly feel like we have opportunities to continue to drive margin enhancement across all 3 of our business groups. Sorry guys.\nDan Arias: Okay. Thanks so much.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: And that concludes the question-and-answer session for this conference call. I will now turn the conference back to Puneet Souda for closing remarks.\nPuneet Souda: Thanks, Paul. And thanks, everyone. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect. Stay safe and well.",

            "content": "Yeah. Mike, happy to give more perspective on China. We actually had a good quarter across the board for all of our business groups within DGG. Specifically, we continue to see real momentum in clinical diagnostic testing, led in pathology.  We've seen really good pick up of our PD - L1, and our diagnostic -- or companion diagnostic there, as we've continued to train more pathologists there in the use and so forth. Genomics also had a really, really, good quarter, both on the consumable side. And we've also just recently announced within the quarter, the launch of our new V8 Xome, which is being well received in China and globally.  And I will tell you one of our absolute strengths in China as it is elsewhere, remain our core NGS and Genomics QC portfolio. So, all of those elements, along with Mike, as you mentioned now, the signing of our first companion diagnostic development agreement with the Biopharma there, I think foretell a continued story of strength in China for DGG."

            "content": "Yeah, thanks for that, Mike (ph.). And that's -- you know, at the analyst said, I think we've talked about in [Indiscernible] that about 70% of our portfolio above that was really focused on Biopharma a so I'm really happy to see that momentum we have right now. And as you also mentioned in the prepared remarks, you know, I'm very pleased with the bio-LC portfolio. In fact, we had and -- and, one of the [Indiscernible] of our momentum is that with that Bio-LC that we introduced here a few months ago.  And we had a virtual conference with more than 1,000 customers participating, and we had more than 25 external scientific speakers, which I would actually say I know it's the best in history by far. So that introduction is actually creating quite a lot of momentum and it allows us to play for all the [Indiscernible] biocompatible space to the 2D-LC, but clearly, also into the Mass Spec, with the Mass Spec at the end of it. And we also mentioned compliance. The FDA [Indiscernible] informatics compliances and all that very important part that most of the Biopharma see as the requirement to do business with them.  And we have invested in this for quite a while, so we ensure that data integrity, audit readiness, and storage of data is the level of security. And right now, we have the offering both supporting our LC, but also all our major marketable Mass Spec instruments. And also, in spectroscopy, with the recent announcement here off the top in the Q2 informatics solutions. So right now, we are -- we have a very strong portfolio and that truly drives our growth. Well, I can continue talking about the cell analysis, but I will -- Yeah, I was going to say, Brandon as we think about this prior to the pandemic, we were probably slower growth than normal were some of the QA, QC refresh was probably elongated. And now we're starting to see that pick back up, and that typically is an 18 to 24 months kind of cycle. And I would say we're still at the beginning of that. And so, feel good about the continued performance of the refresh cycle going forward. Yeah, Mike (ph.). You're absolutely right. I think first of all of them -- I think Bob (ph.) mentioned that also the chemicals and engineered materials market certainly on fire right now, [Indiscernible] in Semicon and in the mining industry, including lease term for batteries.  But we also see the traditional Petrochem markets really start to see some momentum now. And there's a lot of talk about the future of Petrochem but this market is going to pay for quite along. And I think that all the analysis shows that there'll be [Indiscernible], so we see investments coming into this market right now. And the new market that's also coming along is Renewable Energy, which will also use many of our technologies.  And we see a great opportunity there also in the future. They're still in a development phase, but as you know, there's a lot of investments going in here, so we are participating in that also. So, we see a lot of opportunities in GC and the GC is actually seeing momentum both first in the chemical markets, but now into the energy markets. Yes. Exactly. You're actually right on the GT and our strength in our GT, but I think we should also mention our spectroscopy business and the ITPMS, where we have done a lot of work also ITP, OES, and MS, where you're doing a lot of work that is -- that has a very strong market share for the material science. And we continue to take market share in that space also. So, I think you'll see us being very strong here. And we have also a site that we will continue to invest in this market going forward. So that's [Indiscernible] therefore the costumers going forward."

And we're getting back to more normalized service support with our customers, which is more cost associated, of course, with travel, but we're starting to see an accretive margin in Q3 and we're seeing that come through to improve in Q4. So very, very strong in that. In terms of touch rate, we're seeing increased touch on our services and consumables and of course, with the larger install base, this bodes really well for the future, as more attach rates for services and consumers will be available to a very strong outlook."

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks, Barney, and welcome to your first Agilent's earnings call as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. And thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Before covering our Third Quarter financial results, I want to acknowledge the recent passing of Dr. Tachi Yamada, a giant in our industry, and a former Agilent board member. Tachi was much more than a knowledgeable, deeply involved Agilent board member for nine years. As many of you on the call already know, Tachi lived a very full life as a doctor, a scientist, as a humanitarian who was driven to help others.  I know that the Agilent team is not alone in recognizing that Tachi Yamada will be greatly missed. And we extend our deepest sympathies to Tachi's family. Now, on the Third Quarter Review and our updated outlook for the year. In Q3, the very strong, broad-based momentum in our business continues. The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter, exceeding our expectations. Q3 revenue of 1.59 billion is up a reported 26% and is up 21% core. This is against a modest decline of 3% in Q3 of last year. So, we are well above the Fiscal Year 2019 pre-pandemic levels. In addition, like other positive signs of continued momentum, orders outpaced revenue during the quarter. Our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets, and geographies.  The combination of strong top-line performance and execution translated to excellent growth and profitability and earnings per share. Our Q3 operating margin is 26%. This is up 230 basis points from last year. EPS is $1.10, up 41% year-over-year. Agilent success continues to be driven by our build and buy growth strategy and execution prowess. We're developing market-leading products and services, investing in fast-growing businesses, while delivering outstanding customer service, and continue to drive profitability. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have taken actions to ensure Agilent emerges even stronger as a Company.  While we have yet to leave COVID -19 in the rearview mirror, our Q3 results are another indicator our actions are delivering the intended results. Bob will provide more details on end markets and geographies, But I want to briefly highlight our performance in our two largest end markets, Pharma and Chemical & Energy. We continue to perform extremely well in Pharma, our largest market, growing 27% with strength in both small and large molecule segments. Our large molecule business grew roughly 52% in the quarter and now represents 36% of our overall Pharma revenue, up from the mid-20s, just a few years ago.  In chemical energy, our business is recovering faster than expected, expanding 23% in the quarter. This is an acceleration of the momentum we achieved in the first half, and our order funnel continues to strengthen. Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science Applied Markets Group generated revenue of 680 million. LSAG is up 22% on a reported basis, this is up 18% core of just a 4% decline last year. LSAG 's growth is broad-based across all end markets. Our performance was led by strength in Pharma, which is up 22%, and chemical energy up 31%. All businesses delivered strong growth led by cell analysis at 38% growth, and our LC and LCMS businesses, which grew 22%. We continue to strengthen our position in the fast-growing Large Molecule market segment. During the quarter, the LSAG team launched 3 InfinityLab Bio - LC Systems at the well-attended InfinityLab LC Virtual Conference in June. These new products further extend our LC leadership position. In addition, building on our already strong Pharma offerings, we launched new compliance-ready LC/Q - TOF and LC - TOF solutions to our portfolio in the quarter. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted a revenue of 560 million.  This is up a reported 21% and up 15% on a core basis. These results are on top of 1% growth last year. The business is benefiting from increased activity in [Indiscernible] labs and instrument connect rates. This led to more contractive services, on-demand services, and consumables consumption across all end markets. All end markets grew mid-teens or higher, with exception of environmental [Indiscernible] which still grew 9%, The pandemic has shown ACG to be our most durable business with ACG growing each quarter since COVID-19 first emerged. Our customer-focused approach and digital investments continue to pay dividends.  Looking forward, instrument placements and demand as well, [Indiscernible] strong performance by ACG, as we drive attractive rates and increased costs for lifetime value. The diagnostic genomics group produced revenue of 346 million up 44% reported, and up 37% poor, compared to an 8% decline last year. The growth was broad-based across product lines and regions and was led by our NASD GMP Alago business. The ramp of our facility in Frederick, Colorado continues to go very well. The quarterly results exceeded our expectations, easily, surpassing the $50 million revenue milestone.  While one quarter does not make a trend, our team has done a tremendous job increasing output in a high-quality manner. This gives us increased confidence in our ability to exceed the $200 million annual run rate in revenue with existing capacity. In addition, the trained manufacturing line expense is well underway and on schedule. Our Genomics Instrumentation and Consumables businesses rebounded strongly in the quarter, as did our pathology-related businesses. For the first time in several quarters, we saw diagnostic testing above pre-pandemic levels. While we are watching the Delta variant very closely, to date, we have not seen a meaningful negative impact in testing volumes.  I also want to highlight our performance in China. While still less than 10% of DGG revenue, our China business grew 50% in the quarter. We continue to see tangible progress in building a stronger China market position. In Q3, we signed our first ever companion diagnostic development services agreement with a China-based BioPharma Company. Earlier this month, we also announced the initiation of in-country manufacturing for our SureSelect product line. We are very bullish about long-term growth prospects in China for our DGG Product and Services offerings. In addition, the integration of the Resolution Bioscience team is going well. And we are very pleased to enter and expand our participation in the fast-growing NGS-based cancer diagnostic market. It was a busy quarter at Agilent, so I have a few other achievements I'd like to share with you.  Last month we published Agilent's 21st Annual Corporate Social Responsibility report. At a time when some are just starting to look at issues like sustainability and societal impact, this has always been a key part of who we are as a Company. We've been addressing these issues since our founding more than 2 decades ago. I would encourage you to review our report on the Agilent website. We're also very pleased to receive recognition as a great place to work in the U.S. by the Great Place to Work Institute. This resulted from just one more example of us when having a highly engaged and energized team.  And as you know, teams with high engagement win in the market. Looking ahead, building on another excellent quarter and the momentum we're seeing, we expect the business to continue to perform well as we close out what we believe will be the outstanding fiscal year 2021. As a result, we are once again raising our full-year revenue and earnings guidance. Bob (ph) will share more details, but we're expecting a continuation of our excellent top-line growth and earnings generation.  While the world has yet to fully emerge from a global pandemic, Agilent is well-positioned to deliver excellent results again in the fourth quarter. I remain very proud of the Agilent team's ability to consistently deliver for our customers and shareholders. Thank you for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Thanks, Tycho. Sure. Thanks for the congratulatory comments, Tycho, and we really, actually, continue to feel quite good about our performance in China, as Bob and I mentioned in the call script, I think 8% up on 11% last year, and I think our stack growth is around 19% Q2. It's actually up over our stack growth of 17 Q2. We're seeing this good, strong, Pharma and C&E demand in China. Now, the funnels really remain quite robust.  And I think, now getting to your specific question, we're not seeing any significant changes in terms of ability to get the product in. I mean, there's been a lot of noise for years, I have to say, between the U.S and China, yet the business seems to somehow get transacted. So, Bob, I think we're not really overly concerned about those dynamics. We did have somewhat of a little bit of shipment interruption as some of our Academia government customers were \u2013 had [Indiscernible] our VAP tax exemption change.  But I think that was a relatively minor impact on the P&L. But clearly, we're monitoring those developments and you have to continue to work to make sure you've got the logistics of flowing through the country, but we've always been able to find a way and are not overly concerned about it at this point. Yes, that's having one other thought here, Tycho (ph.), is relative logistics. We have divested into a number of forward-looking stocking locations over the last few years, not really has paid us dividend, because we are less dependent on stuff coming directly into the port because we have a lot of in-country inventory. Yes. Thanks. Those specifics, but what I can tell you is that we feel really good about the momentum of the business, the order book is continuing to be strong and that's as of today, where we got the latest view of the early orders through August, so all the momentum remains there.  As I mentioned on our prior earnings call, we feel a really good ability to meet and exceed those long-term growth goals we put out, and the margin goals. I think that's where we stand right now, is we'll get to that in November, but we're feeling good about the trajectory of the business momentum we built here. Good afternoon, Brandon. Yes. Sure. And then I'm actually going to invite Bob and I will also want to have Jacob make a few comments on some of those new introductions here. I think I used the word broad-based, at least 5 or 6 times, maybe 10 times in my prepared remarks and we're seeing that in the biopharma.  So, we've got across the board, double-digit growth happening here. Cell Analysis LC, LCMS, other platforms that go into Biopharma, along with our consumables and services. And then to your point, really outstanding growth in NASD. But while NASD was a big contributor, it was an Agilent-wide life story. And Bob, maybe you can just answer the specifics on the numbers? And Brandon (ph.), I just wanted to maybe have Jacob (ph.) jump in very quickly because we have a continued drumbeat of new introductions into this space as well, which has been the focus and prioritization of our R&D pipeline. Jacob (ph.), I know we had 2 big introductions in Q3 as well. I'm going to bounce it back to Brandon. Hey Brandon, thanks for allowing us to do an advertisement on the Agilent portfolio strength. But, back do you. Do you have any additional questions? It's our view that there is always a replacement market going on in the Small Molecule space, and sometimes, it picks up a bit more. But then -- and I think we're in that phase right now. I wouldn't say it's a huge acceleration, it's just the solid and probably high changes. Thanks, Vijay. So, you do some very good math. So, it's about half-a-point of reported growth rate, Bob. And I'd say relative to Q3, probably a little bit behind the revenue as we learn more about this business or some elements of this global lumpiness, so we're feeling pretty good about how our business will finish, but we're expecting a lot in the Fourth Quarter. I think this is a story of continued acceleration of growth in '22 and beyond and we're just super delighted by the early days of how the teams feel about being part of Agilent.  And then we're really building scale around this business. So, I think it's still a relatively small part of the overall revenue picture today for Agilent, and we knew that going in, I think is roughly [Indiscernible] million, but we would expect really strong growth rates in the coming years and again, we really feel like we're off to a great start with this team.  Just interacting with Mark Li, who is the founder -- co-founder of Resolution Bio. He is really happy about the capabilities that we're bringing to his business to further scale it. So early days, but feeling good -- pretty good about things and [Indiscernible] I don't know if you're saying [Indiscernible] And Vijay (ph.), this is Mike, if I can just add one additional comment too, and I hopefully came out in my prepared remarks, but we're not holding back on investing for growth. So, we're quite pleased with the margin performance, but it didn't come at the expense of our ability to grow down the road. Thank you. Yes. We're still building our plan. But our intent is to still be able to drive that margin expansion. I will say that we are having our new Train B in NASD come online, which will add a little pressure to it. But, I think, we've been very good about being able to do 30% to 40% incremental and sometimes even higher than that when the margin comes in. And I don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to do that, Doug. I would just add. [Indiscernible] we're under 22 now. Sorry to interrupt there, but I'd just say that some of our programs, and -- and such are really geared towards making sure we can manage our way through this in '22, so we're on this already. [Indiscernible] I know. Bob and I are smiling in the room here, and, I think, we can probably put a checkmark on all -- first of those 3 things you mentioned. Yeah, I think that that's fair. I think -- what we've tried to do is set prudent guidance as we've talked about in the past. But certainly, as we've and our customers, more importantly, the market is getting used to dealing in a COVID world, there are fewer variables to be able to understand. And I would look at just what we did in Q2 to Q3, we dramatically increased our Q3 guidance and then did the same thing here for Q4. So, I think our visibility is improving. You should take that away for all the things so you rattled off. Certainly, Hey, Derik. Hey, Derik. Hey, how do I take the first one in Bob -- I mean, Bob and Jacob, you may want to add additional comments here. But let me talk about the question around gas chromatography. We are seeing that.  And that's really behind a lot of the fairly bullish comments, if you will, around C&E space. So, we're seeing it in our GC revenue, and we're also seeing it in our GC order book. And I've been very reluctant to call that hey, we think this business is now in a situation of returning to growth.  That reluctance has now passed. I think we're now into what looks to be the start of some really good potential business on our GC side, as that replacement cycle turns back on. And Jacob, I know you're a lot closer to the detail\u2019s alignments, anything else you could add to that? Yeah. I would say too, Derik, just to give you a frame, China was more than twice the -- China C&E market was in line with the overall C&E growth rate that we saw. Good afternoon. I'd say it's relevant till we change it. So, I'm not ready to, on the fly here, revise our long-term growth. But as you may recall, in our December outlook, we said, think about us being more of the high range in that area. And I think [Indiscernible] a little tougher so I put a 7 out there in any type of long-term growth guidance. I think what's changing is the nature of our portfolio, which is we continue to build very quickly, much bigger positions in faster-growing segments. And I think it's probably fair to say that the Pharma market, in particular, the Biopharma market is -- remains very robust, but again, we're sticking with those long-term growth goals at this point in time. Yes, I'm going to invite Sam on this call. He hasn't had a chance to work today in this call. So, Sam, your thoughts of what's been going on in China, I was doing a little bragging on your growth rate there. And just to build on Sam's comments, I mean, we've been working really hard the last several years putting in the right foundational capabilities, building the right commercial channel, the right ability to handle diagnostics products ourselves, and it's really great to actually see those investment starting to pay off in year term growth. Sure. Yes. Now I'm glad you picked up on that. We really want that to come through in the call. And I think the confidence is coming from not only the revenues that we've reported, but as Bob (ph.) mentioned in general, and I think it also holds for C&E, we just have much better visibility into our funnel. And you may have recalled I was talking a lot of -- in prior calls, I talk a lot about a conversation we're having with customers and we knew there was activity.  But now that conversation is turning into orders. So, we're feeling much better about the trajectory of the C&E space. Historically I've been very cautious to give any real kind of positive trends in this area. But I think we've seen enough over the last few quarters and what we're seeing with our customers and the order book is really the basis for this confidence.  And again, it's tied to not only the pent-up demand they've had in terms of even replacing aged equipment in their laboratories, but they are also -- what we hear from our customers, there are much more confident about where the global economy is going.  So, they're willing to make investments. A couple of positives here and there and there will be some ups and downs because of outbreaks here and there of COVID, but in general, the [Indiscernible] remains very positive, I think as Bob mentioned earlier, our customers have learned to deal with this. So, Bob, I know this is -- we've talked a lot about this, anything I missed there? Okay. Thank you. I think I'll pass it on to Borick (ph.), who can provide some additional color to the ACG and answer your questions. Go ahead, Borick. Yes, hey, and Matt, maybe just to build on what Borick(ph.) is saying in terms of sustainability, we feel very good about the ability to continue to sustain those levels of margin. It gets back to the work that our service engineers do in servicing our customers. It's mission-critical for our customers, keeping those labs and those instruments up. And our ability to continue to invest in digital, as well as, be there on-site on the labs or with the labs is really important.  A one piece that I would add is we continue to invest in that digital as I mentioned before, and our online orders actually grew faster -- our revenue grew faster than the overall ACG business, which actually speaks to our continued relevance in that space. And obviously, that's good for our customers in terms of either doing business with Agilent, but it also helps from that margin perspective as well. I don't know where they slowed. I'm not sure they're investing for that segment. So, and we're not seeing much happen on the competitive side. We're by far this is -- we're the clear leader in this space, we've continued to invest in our core portfolio pre and throughout the pandemic. So, as you can tell, I'm pretty bullish about our ability to outgrow the competition in this space. Yeah. Let me talk about the fourth quarter and I'm not sure we're going to answer the last one just yet as we're going through our plan, but --. Yes, yes, that was a good try. But I would say for Q4, you're accurate in the belief that our book-to-bill was positive for the quarter, and if you think about Q4, our guidance comprehends high single-digit, low double-digit growth for the LSAG business core growth. And so, I'll leave it at that. Yeah. We'll address that in the Q1 call. But to your point, we've been pleasantly surprised, and it has continued to be stronger than what we've anticipated throughout the first 3 quarters, and what I would say is we don't expect that to slow down any in Q4 either. Yes, I mean, this has been a lot of discussion on that. I think everybody is talking about the supply chain constraints on a global basis. It's been a challenge for us, but as Bob noted in this call script, our team has just done a tremendous job getting the Agilent products to our customers. And we're really good at this about managing situations.  So, we will work on a number of commodity areas for some time. And we also have done things as identifying a changing alternatives source, supply. So, we've been able to do that. We've had a last-minute changes notification from logistics suppliers that they won't pick up our boxes, and so we switched to another supplier.  So, we've been able to manage our way through that. And it was conspicuous, it was absent in our cost script a lot of details because while we continue to monitor it, we don't believe that's a material risk to the Company at this time, and we still likely -- we factored all that into our guide for the fourth quarter. And Bob (ph.), I know that you've done a close study of this as well, anything else you'd add to that? Sure. Sure. No problems. I do think it's possible. I'm not going to call out because I'm not going to let -- if I call out one, I'm not going to let the other two Division Presidents off the hook. They must have paid you. I think we could continue to do it across the board.  Certainly, we are making investments across all three of the businesses to continue to grow. But we certainly feel like we have opportunities to continue to drive margin enhancement across all 3 of our business groups. Sorry guys. Thanks, Dan."

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. And good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on Q3 revenue, and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike mentioned, we had an excellent result in the Third Quarter. Revenue was 1.59 billion, reflecting reported growth of 26%. Core revenue growth was 21%. Currency added, 4.5% for the quarter, and M&A added 0.5. In addition, COVID-related revenues were in line with the prior year.  All end markets performed well with Pharma and Chemical & Energy as standouts versus [Indiscernible] expectations. Our largest market Pharma, grew 27% during the quarter, after growing 2% last year. The performance was led by the continued strength in our large molecule business, growing 52%, while our Small Molecule business grew mid-teens. And all regions in the pharma market grew double-digits. Our Large Molecule business was driven by our NASD division and demand for LC and Mass Spec instrumentation and solutions. While our Small Molecule business was primarily driven by QA/QC refresh.  Chemical & Energy also performed well this quarter, with 23% growth. Even after accounting for the comparison against the 10% decline last year, this was clearly our best quarter since the onset of the pandemic. This result was driven by increasing momentum and demand for advanced materials and the general global economic growth. Our view is that the Chemical and Energy market still has additional room to grow moving forward. The diagnostics and clinical, we're very encouraged with the continued recovery in the market as our genomics and pathology businesses saw very good growth.  On a regional basis, all regions grew with China up 41% and America is delivering 38% growth. In academia, in the government market, we delivered 12% growth as most research labs continue to open globally and expand capacity. On a regional basis, Europe led the way. The Food market continued its double-digit performance, growing 12% on top of growing 1% last year. Food manufacturers continue to invest in increased testing to ensure quality and authenticity. A developing cannabis testing market, primarily in the U.S. also contributed to the growth in this market.  And regionally, the food market was led by the Americas and Europe. Rounding out our key markets, environmental and forensics came in with 5% growth. On a geographic basis, all regions demonstrated solid growth led by the Americas at 32% and Europe at 23%, both exceeding our expectations. The performance was broad-based across all markets. And as expected, China was up 8% on top of 11% growth last year. All 3 business groups grew in China during the quarter. Pharma, Chemical & Energy, and Diagnostics were the key drivers. Now, turning to the rest of the P&L. Third Quarter gross margin was 55.9% up 80 basis points from a year ago, despite roughly 40 basis points of headwind from currency.  Our strong top-line, some positive product mix, coupled with the strong execution from our operations team, drove the year-over-year improvement. And our supply chain team is doing a tremendous job getting our products to customers despite the increase in demand. Gross margin improvement in performance, along with continued operating expense leverage, resulted in operating margin for the third quarter of 26%, improving 230 basis points over last year. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.10 up 41% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75% and the share count was 306 million shares as expected.  We delivered $334 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, showing a strong conversion from net income and up more than 15% from last year. During the quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends, and repurchasing roughly 800,000 shares for $113 million. Year-to-date, we've returned $829 million to shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases, a leverage ratio of 0.8. Accounting for our Q3 performance and improved outlook in the fourth quarter, we are again raising our full-year projections for both revenue and earnings per share.  We are increasing our full-year revenue projection to a range of 6.29 to 6.32 billion, up to $125 million at the midpoint from previous guidance. and representing reported growth of 17.8% to 18.4%. in core growth of 14.5% to 15%. Included is roughly three points of impact from currency and a small amount from M&A. In addition, we're on track to deliver, roughly $100 million in COVID-related revenue in fiscal 2021, in line with our expectations from the beginning of the year and flat to last year. We expect to continue our strong operating leverage, and so we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $4.28 to $4.31 per share, up 30% to 31% for the year.  This translates to fourth-quarter revenue ranging from 1.63 billion to 1.66 billion. This represents reported growth of 10% to 12%, and core growth of 8.5% to 10%, on top of the 6% growth in Q4 of last year, when we started to see early signs of recovery from the strict lockdowns. In addition, while COVID revenue was roughly flat year-on-year for the full year, last year's fiscal fourth quarter represented the high-water mark in our COVID-related revenue. And as a result, we expect to see roughly a 1-point headwind due to COVID revenue in the quarter.  So, our core growth, excluding COVID, would be comparable to 9.5% to 11%. We are forecasting higher expenses in the fourth quarter as we invest to maintain our strong momentum, but expect continued operating leverage in excess of 100 basis points. non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between 1.15 and 1.18 with a growth of 17% to 20%. Now before opening the call for questions, I want to reiterate that we continue to see good demand in our end markets, have solid momentum in all our businesses, and expect to close the year extremely well. We believe our strategies are the right ones for Agilent, but we couldn't achieve these results, we [Indiscernible] without the excellent execution by the team. With that Barney (ph) back to you for Q&A. Yes. I would say, Tycho. We continue to invest in China as we mentioned in the call. And there are always bumps here and there, but long-term we feel very good about the business in China. Yeah. And Brandon, to your point, the total in Large Molecules was 52% as I mentioned before. But even if you back out the NASD businesses still grew in excess of 40%. So very strong business on NASD, but it shows that the rest of the business, both instrumentations, as well as the consumables pieces and the other elements on the Pharma associated revenue in Diagnostics and Genomics also, very strong business in it. Yeah, I was just going to say the other thing is, obviously, we're just now having more and more conversations with our existing CDx customers and the power of being able to have our established CDx business on the [Indiscernible] side coupled with NGS-based technology, I think is going to be a real significant competitive advantage for us going forward. So very excited about this business going forward. Yeah, Vijay, it's a great question. And I think if you remember, maybe a year ago we talked about some of these expenses that were going down, and our goal was not to have them come back to the same levels that they had. And these would be in areas around travel, but also leveraging our digital capabilities, and what we've been able to do is be very successful. Certainly, volume is our friend. And the leverage that we've been able to drive across all three of our business groups has really helped.  But if you look at our year-over-year elements around travel and costs associated with marketing programs and digital investments. Our digitals investments have gone up, but the actual return on those investments has actually gone up. And in fact, Jacob just highlighted one of the programs that we had. And so those are -- our goals are for those to continue -- they will continue to ramp next year to come back, but not near the level that they had come prior to the pandemic.  So, we do think that there's a fundamental margin improvement associated with these expenses. And that's why Mike talked about our long-term margin expansion story is intact. It's not going to be 200+ basis points like it were this last quarter, but certainly feel good about our continued ability to drive margin expansion. Maybe what's -- yes, maybe what's underlying your question is inflationary pressures and activities around that I would say that we didn't see any material impact. Obviously, there is some but we're planning to manage that going forward. the momentum that we're seeing, the general economic improvements, and so forth. But as you mentioned, there's still a Delta variant out there, and so well, as Mike mentioned, we haven't seen any impact of that yet. We also recognize that that could change during the course of the quarter. So, we're trying to take all those factors into account, but also try to provide some realistic guidance going forward. You're welcome, Doug. Yes. So, Bob, I think it's fair to say that there really is no difference across the regions. I mean, China actually was the area of strength for us in C&E, and I think we're seeing good -- good strength globally, which I think points to the importance of global economic outlook for this segment. And I'd say we're probably earlier middle innings on the -- paused there for a while because we got rate run going with the new portfolio, but a pause. I'd say we're early innings, middle innings. I would say, Dan, to build on what Mike is saying, particularly the pharma market. We do feel that that market, and in fact, Mike talked about it in his prepared remarks that we're emerging as a stronger Company. We do think that the Pharma market, really driven by that Large Molecule area, is a faster-growing market coming out of the pandemic than going into it.  And I think if we look at where our investments are and the performance that we've had in particularly the Large Molecule. Now again, Small Molecule has been doing very well. That, in and of itself, would elevate that overall long-term growth rate to be faster than what we saw going in, which certainly helps us, given that is -- that's our largest market. So, I'll leave it at that. No. Yeah. I mean, we saw continued recovery. I think we mentioned at the beginning -- at the end of Q2 that we were at pre-pandemic. We exited there. The average was still below. And that steady improvement across our business, across really across all of the regions continued into Q3. And by the end of Q3, we were above. And Patrick, to your specific question about Delta, we have not seen any impact to date associated with that. Yeah. Sure. Yeah, let me add. It seems like a long time ago, but we launched 2 new GCs back in 2019, both at the high end and a mid-range GC. And we talked about one of the reasons that we did that is we've got a leadership position in the GC market. But when you look at it, we're over-index to the high-end, and so the ability for us to be able to have this mid -- mid-range, I think was really critical, and we're starting to see that benefit. And maybe Jacob wants to jump in that conversation. Yeah. Yeah. The only thing I would say is it's the usual suspects that other folks have called out, things like [Indiscernible] and our team has done, to date, an outstanding job of being able to continue to satisfy demand here.  And our expectation is that that's going to continue to happen into Q4. And we've got a continuous improvement program that continues to drive productivity and efficiency gains. And we're expecting that, and to combat some of these inflationary pressures as well as continuing to deliver to our customers. And we will continue to do that into '22 as well. What I would say, Jack, it's a good question, and our products aren't directly tied to the testing. We didn't see the dramatic increase but also didn't see the dramatic decline with the testing there. Ours is more around expanding capacity both in testing and over the course of this last year. We've actually seen it migrate to more therapeutic capacity or excuse me, vaccine capacity in demand there.  And so, we don't see it spiking up or not building that into Q4. I think it's a little too early to tell for -- for FY22. It's been -- it's been reasonably steady the last couple of quarters. And we do expect contribution in '22 and we'll provide more color as we get through our planning process, but we don't see it dramatically dropping off."

The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike?\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Ruben, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Before I get into the quarterly details, I want to start by recognizing our Agilent India team. Despite the challenging COVID-19 situation, our India team is working closely with our customers to do what we can to help in this time of extreme need. In addition, our Agilent India customer support, finance, and IT teams have worked tirelessly to help us close out the second quarter and keep us moving forward. I could not be more proud of how the team has worked together in true \u2018One Agilent\u2019 fashion. Our thoughts go out to the entire Agilent India team and their families during this difficult time. In Q2, the strong momentum in our business continues against the backdrop of a recovering market. The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter exceeding our expectations. Both revenue and earnings are up sharply versus a solid Q2 last year, when revenues and earnings per share were relatively flat. Our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets, and geographies. We also expanded margins, driving faster earnings per share growth. Revenues for the quarter are $1.525 billion. This is up 23% on a reported basis and up 19% core. COVID-19 related revenues account for roughly 2% of overall revenues as expected and contributed about a point to our overall growth. Our revenue growth is not a one quarter or easy compare story, but one of sustained above market growth. For example, our Q2 revenues are up more than 17% core from two years ago. Q2 operating margins are 23.9%. This is up 150 basis points. EPS of $0.97 is up 37% year-over-year. Late in the quarter, we also welcomed the Resolution Bioscience team to Agilent, continuing our investments in high-growth markets and bringing outstanding talent into Agilent. Like our recent acquisitions in cell analysis, Resolution Bioscience is an example of our build and buy growth strategy in action. The Agilent story remains the same. It is a story of one team outpacing the market to deliver strong, broad based growth in an environment of a continuing market recovery. Moving on to our end-market highlights, we grew strongly in all markets. Our growth is led by 29% growth in pharma and 22% in food. We are seeing improving growth in the chemical and energy market with 14% growth. We also posted low teens growth in diagnostics and over 20% growth in academia and government. Lastly, environmental and forensics grew 8%. Bob will provide more end-market detail later in his comments. Geographically, the Americas led the way with 27% growth. Strength in China, Europe and the rest of Asia continues with all growing in the mid-teens. The 13% growth in China is on top of 4% growth last year when the business started to recover from the pandemic. As we look at our performance by business group, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $674 million during the quarter. LSAG is up 28% on a reported basis and up 25% core, off a 7% decline last year. LSAG\u2019s growth is broad-based, across all end-markets and geographies. Our focus and investments in fast growing end markets continues to pay off. The LSAG pharma business is very strong, growing 41% with strength in both biopharma and small molecule. From a product perspective, we saw strength in liquid chromatography and LCMS along with continued growth in cell analysis. During the quarter, cell analysis grew 34%, with our BioTek business growing close to 40%. During the quarter, the LSAG team also contributed to our long-term company-wide focus on sustainability in advancing important ESG initiatives. LSAG announced several new products that have earned the highly respected Accountability, Consistency, and Transparency, ACT Label from My Green Lab. My Green Lab is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the sustainability of scientific research. LSAG products also received two Scientists' Choice Awards announced at the SelectScience Virtual Analytical Summit. In our cell analysis business during the quarter, we launched our Cytation 10 Confocal Imaging Reader, a multi-functional automated system focused on research labs and core facilities looking for increased productivity. This product builds on the BioTek cell imaging leadership with the Cytation multi-mode reader and expands our reach in this strategic business. While still early, customer feedback has been extremely positive. We are also very pleased with the progress and trajectory of our cell analysis business overall and see a very positive future for this space. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $536 million. This is up a reported 19% and up 15% on a core basis versus a 1% increase last year. ACG\u2019s growth is driven by demand for consumables and services across the portfolio as lab activity continues to increase for our customers. This is leading to more on-demand services and parts consumption. Revenues from our contract business continue to drive strong growth due to the high level of contract renewals seen in the previous quarter. Our strong instrument placements and the increasing installed base will benefit the ACG business going forward. At the same time, our digital investments continue to pay off with continued strong customer uptake in consumables and our digitally enabled service offerings. Our LSAG and ACG business has come together in the analytical lab. This is where we believe we are well-positioned to continue driving above market growth as we build on our market leading portfolio, strong service organization, and outstanding customer service. For the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, revenues were $315 million, up 20% reported and up 16% core versus a 5% increase last year. Growth is broad-based, led by our NASD oligo and genomics businesses. Demand for our NASD offerings remains strong and our capacity expansion plans for our high-growth NASD business remain on-track. We\u2019re very pleased with our acquisition of Resolution Bioscience during the quarter. With their liquid biopsy technology, Resolution Bioscience is a key player in a very exciting area of cancer diagnostics. We are very glad to have them on the Agilent team. I\u2019m confident that as time goes on, you will be hearing more and more from us on this business and its contributions. I would now like to recap the second quarter and take a look forward. The strong momentum in our business continues. This is being driven by our relentless customer focus, the strength of our portfolio and the execution capability of the One Agilent team. Our build and buy growth strategy is delivering, as intended, with above-market growth. Over the last year, I have often said that Agilent is focused on coming out of the pandemic even stronger as a company. I believe you\u2019re seeing the impact of this approach in our current results. As we look ahead, we do so with a sense of both optimism and confidence. We are optimistic because of the continued market recovery and the strength of our portfolio. We are confident because we have the right team, customer focused, operationally excellent and driven to win. As a result, we are once again raising our full-year revenue and earnings guidance. Bob will share more details, but we are expecting a continuation of our excellent top line growth. We also expect to convert this strong top line into excellent earnings growth and cash generation. During our investor event in December, we discussed our shareholder value creation model and our goals for increasing long-term growth and expanding margins. Six months into fiscal 2021, we are well on our way to achieving those objectives. Our build and buy growth strategy is delivering. The One Agilent team continues to demonstrate its execution prowess and strong drive to win. We\u2019ve raised the bar on customer service and continue to exceed customer expectations in providing industry-leading products and services. While we have yet to fully emerge from the global pandemic, we are looking forward to the future with both optimism and confidence. Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?\nBob McMahon: Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I\u2019ll provide some additional details on Q2 revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our updated outlook for 2021 and the third quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Revenue for the second quarter was $1.525 billion, reflecting reported growth of 23%. Core revenue growth was 19%, while currency contributed just under 4 points of growth. We are very pleased with our second quarter results as we saw strong, broad based growth with all three business groups posting mid-teens growth or higher, and all end markets growing strongly. From an end-market perspective, our focus on fast growing markets is paying off. Pharma, our largest market, again led the way, delivering 29% growth. This is on top of growing 5% last year. Growth was led by cell analysis, LC, and Mass Spec. These tools are delivering critical capabilities to our Bio-Pharma customers as they continue to make investments to develop new therapies and vaccines. Our biopharma business grew roughly 40% and represented over 35% of our pharma business in the quarter. Our small molecule segment also has momentum, growing in the mid-20s in the quarter. Overall, we are well-positioned within pharma and expect the pharma market to continue being the strongest end-market as we enter the second half of the year. The food market continued its strong performance, growing 22%. We experienced strong growth across all regions and segments as we continue to see global investments across the entire food supply-chain. We were very pleased to see the non-COVID diagnostics businesses continue to improve throughout the quarter growing 13% as routine doctor visits returned closer to pre-pandemic levels. We posted a very strong month in the diagnostics and clinical market as we came to anniversary the weak April we experienced in our large markets at the onset of the pandemic last year. And we exited the quarter with testing volumes at a run rate slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels. The chemical and energy end-market continues to recover as we grew 14% off a decline of 10% last year. Our results were primarily driven by continued strength in the chemicals and materials markets. And in a positive sign, our order growth rates were ahead of revenues and finished the quarter strong, leading us to believe this trend will continue. We also saw a nice recovery in the academia and government market as non-COVID-related labs resume operations in a strong funding environment. With the increase in activity, our business grew 21% against the weakest comparison of the year. We would expect the academia and government market to continue to recover throughout the rest of the year. Lastly, the environmental and forensics market saw high single-digit growth driven by the Americas, services and consumables, and atomic spectroscopy. On a geographic basis, all regions grew, led by the Americas at 27%. The pharma and academia and government markets in Americas grew in the low 30% range and all markets grew at least 20%. Europe experienced 16% growth led by food, academia, and government, and C&E. Those three markets all grew more than 20%. And as Mike noted, China grew 13% after growing 4% last year. This was driven by pharma growth in the high 30s. Our growth in orders outpaced revenue growth by mid-single digits during the quarter. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, second quarter gross margin was 55.4%, flat year-on-year despite a headwind of more than 30 basis points from currency. Our operating margin for the second quarter came in at 23.9%. Driven by volume, this is up a solid 150 basis points from last year even as we saw increased spending as activity ramped and we invest in the future. Strong top line growth coupled with our operating leverage helped deliver EPS of $0.97, up 37% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75% and share count was 307 million shares.  Now, on to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our performance translated into very strong cash flows. We delivered $472 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, up more than 50% from last year. This strong cash flow has continued to help drive our balanced capital deployment strategy. During the quarter, we retuned $254 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends, and repurchasing 1.55 million shares for $195 million. And as Mike mentioned, we also continue to strategically invest in the business. We spent a net of $547 million to purchase Resolution Bioscience and invested $31 million in capital expenditures. Year to-date, we\u2019ve returned $657 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while re-investing in the business by spending $619 million on M&A and capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, which enables us to enjoy financial flexibility going forward.  During the quarter, we raised $850 million in long term debt at very favorable terms, redeemed $300 million that was maturing next year and reduced our ongoing interest expense. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 1X. Now, turning to the outlook for the full-year and the third quarter, we see great opportunity to build on our strong first half results. Looking forward, while the pandemic is still with us, we continue to see recovery in our end-markets and have solid momentum in all our businesses. As a result, we\u2019re again increasing our full-year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. This reflects our strong Q2 results and increasing expectations for the second half of the year. We are also incorporating the Resolution Bioscience into our new guidance. For revenue, we are increasing our full-year to a range of $6.15 billion to $6.21 billion, up nearly $320 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 15% to 16% and core growth of 12% to 13%. Included is roughly 3 points of currency and about a half-point attributable to M&A. This increased outlook also reflects continued growth in our end-markets. We see sustained momentum in the second half of the year in the pharma, food, and environmental and forensic markets. End markets that we expect will continue to recover in the second half include diagnostics and clinical, academic and government, and C&E. As Mike mentioned during our investor event in December, we provided a long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Our updated guidance for the year exceeds the top end of that range. In addition, we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $4.09 to $4.14 per share. This is growth of 25% to 26% for the year. Now for the third fiscal quarter, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.51 million to $1.54 billion, representing reported growth of 20% to 22% and core growth of 15% to 17.5%. And we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.97 to $0.99 per share with growth of 24% to 27%. Now, before opening the call for questions, I want to say, we\u2019re extremely pleased with how we\u2019ve started the first half of the year. We believe our strategies and our execution are driving the strong results we\u2019ve achieved and put us in a great position to continue to drive strong results for the remainder of the year. With that, Ruben back to you for Q&A.\nRuben DiRado: Thanks Bob. Gabriel, if you could please provide instruction for the Q&A.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a pretty impressive [half year]. I did want to start on pharma BioTek. It accelerated sequentially the number, it's really impressive, 35 on large molecule plus 28 in small molecule, so maybe talk about what is driving this maybe at a high level, if you can talk about what is your end-market growing? Is this a market acceleration? Are you guys gaining share and how much of this is incremental contribution for NASD? I think the prior assumption was $200 million in the fiscal coming in about?\nMike McMullen: Yes, there was a lot to unpack there Vijay. I'll take the congratulations Vijay and I'll pass the [indiscernible] to Bob. No. Yes, we're extremely pleased with the results that we've seen in the pharma business really across all three of our end business groups. I think it shows the investments in the great execution by the team that has been paying off over the last several years and I think what you're seeing is not only a market recovery for sure, but I think the relevance of our portfolio across all three of our business groups in that business, and certainly we are benefiting from the investments to expand capacity and new therapeutics across various end markets. But I also think the number of new products that we have launched in this space are really seeing a nice uptake. And on NASD to your point, I mean, we saw nice growth in NASD was in the high 30s and we are still on track for that $200 million that you talked about. And feel very good about that business going forward.\nBob McMahon: And my perspective, I think we're capturing share in a faster growing market. So, I think there is a combination of both above expectations on market growth, but we're also getting more than our fair share of that market.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful comments there Mike. One question on perhaps a more medium-term question and I'm not asking for guidance, but I think the question on the Group has been, the comps are going to be pretty hard for some of these companies. Certainly COVID diagnostics has been [Technical Difficulty] I think you guys are one of the cleanest stories here in the group. But again, if I'm looking at this guide of high teens, perhaps talk about maybe broad strokes what is sustainable, it looks like some of these trends, Biopharma share gains etcetera should be sustainable? Maybe some product line on that, how to think about the plus and the minuses?\nMike McMullen: Hey Bob, maybe if I can start with some comments? So, I think if there has been a positive on COVID, I think it's actually stimulating to some increased levels of investments in some of these end markets. So, we think that that some of these growth rates we've seen from the markets perspective are sustainable for a while. And we mentioned earlier, our story is a core business story. We've been very pleased that our team has been able to participate and have a role here to play in the fight against COVID-19, but our story really is all about what we're doing in terms of driving the core business.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, good afternoon. I wanted to actually start with the M&A question just on resolution. Their obviously a CLIA lab, but have a distributed model as well. Can you just talk about those two businesses? I know the overall revenue contribution this year is like $50 million, $55 million, but how do you think about leveraging both the CLIA lab and the distributed model across your portfolio going forward?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Tycho thanks for the question and good afternoon. I'll make a few comments here and I'll pass it over to Sam. So, my comments are going to be, we're very excited about having Resolution Bioscience team as part of Agilent. And Sam, I think we were even becoming even more excited now that we've had even a deeper look about what's been going on with the company and I think you've just come back from a visit from with the team. So you've had a chance of our \u2013 because maybe perhaps your first face to face business trip in well over a year, but with that lead in, why don't I pass over to you and answer Tycho's question.\nSam Raha: Yes. Thanks Mike. Thanks for the question, Tycho. Yes, it was very exciting to finally get out and see real human beings again and very exciting to see the enthusiasm of the team there. And first-hand what is now part of our company. And Tycho the specific answer is, both parts are important. The primary business today that we have in Resolution Bio is related to pharma services, very much akin to what we do in our traditional CDx business here at Agilent, it's working with pharma to better understand biomarkers and then to develop companion diagnostics, which will [ultimately block] the market. There is some testing that's done in the CLIA lab as you mentioned, there is a relationship with LabCorp, and that is something that we expect over time to ramp, both because of the testing for LabCorp and also testing that will result from actual companion diagnostics that are approved as part of the former work that we're doing, but both are important, but the substantial part of our revenue today in this year, and even in the coming 18 months, 24 months will continue to be some pharma services revenue.\nMike McMullen: Yeah. That's the focus.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. And then on the quarter \u2013 two quick follow-ups, Mike, food up 22%. I know you talked about all regions and segments strong and sustained momentum. But we don't think about that market being 20% plus growth sustainably. So, can you just talk about whether there is stockpiling? How much of this is China coming out of the overhaul there? And then totally unrelated question on ACG operating margins, they were down about 90 bps. I'm just curious is that reinvestment there?\nMike McMullen: Yes, sure. You're close study on the numbers, I can see it Tycho, so thanks for two good questions. So, while we're super pleased with the overall growth rate of food, it's been a story here for a number of quarters. We don't expect it to be a 20% growth rate in 2022 and years beyond, but we are expecting continued strength throughout this year, probably not at that same level. And Bob, I think it's really a \u2013 clinically China is part of that story, but in fact, when we look across the globe, it's been a \u2013 we also saw strength in other geographies as well. And I don't have exact...\nBob McMahon: Yes, that's right.\nMike McMullen: Geographic split, but it was a broad-based kind of story, with China leading the way, being the key part but not the only part of the story.\nBob McMahon: Yes, absolutely, Tycho to Mike's point I think we see this kind of reverting back over time, but certainly what we're seeing is increased investment and increased testing here really around the globe. And China was actually slightly lower than the overall core business, you saw a strong recovery both in Americas and Europe and the Rest of Asia. And I think we're seeing some halo effect of COVID testing kind of a surveillance testing in various aspects of China or of food testing. And so, I think we feel very good about the business there. And then I think on your question...\nMike McMullen: Bob I just want to add one thing. Additional thought in the Americas, historically that's been a lower growth rate for us in food. But with the inclusion of the cannabis testing market we're getting a bit of a bump there as well.\nBob McMahon: Yes, thanks. Thanks Mike. And I think what you're seeing in the ACG business Tycho, is a combination of two things. One is some reinvestment, we continue to double down in areas like the digital investments to continue to increase our capabilities there and then you did see some increased activity, and so as we actually see this is a good thing. Our sales and field service engineers are traveling to more customers. And so, we're seeing some increases there associated with just increased activity, which we saw on the on-demand side, but it also comes with some incremental cost. But long-term, we feel very good about our ACG business and continued ability to scale that business going forward.\nMike McMullen: Absolutely.\nTycho Peterson: Okay, thank you.\nMike McMullen: You're welcome.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDoug Schenkel: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just doing some math here, and Bob I'm trying to make us a little more sense of your guidance. On one hand, you guided fiscal Q3 revenue expectations well above consensus. On the other hand your guidance assumes essentially that revenue is going to move sideways, maybe even move I think down sequentially in a quarter, which I think is normally a little bit better relative to fiscal Q2, if for no other reason than in China, one of your bigger markets, you don't have a Lunar New Year in that period. And then we're kind of back into the Q4 implied number, you know there is I think something like 4% sequential growth and a pretty big implied moderation in year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter relative to the rest of the year even accounting for comps. So, there\u2019s all that, you've got more M&A in there. And then, I listened to what you're seeing in your prepared remarks, and look at the numbers and it sure seems like you're crushing it with no slowdown. So, am I missing anything here?\nBob McMahon: No, I think you are reading the numbers very well, Doug. And what I would say is, certainly, we feel very good about Q3 and that's where we have most of our visibility. We still are in a pandemic, but we feel good about the recovery and our \u2013 I think still a little prudent in terms of our forecast going forward. We want to see how the continued rollout of the vaccines are around the world and I think there isn't anything that in the near term that we see is going to stop us from our momentum.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then again doing math on the fly, so hopefully, I'm not messing up anything.\nBob McMahon: But your math on the fly is pretty good Doug.\nDoug Schenkel: I am doing okay so far. Thank you. So, it seems like you're assuming operating investment growth 15% year-over-year in the second half or something like that, just backing into that from the top and bottom line. And that seems to be a couple of points higher than the revenue growth rate you're guiding to for the second half. So, assuming I'm still doing this right, could you just talk about what some of the key areas of investment focus are? It seems like you're planning on maybe opportunistically pulling forward some investment even separate from the M&A? And then building off of that, if you are in a position to drive revenue upside relative to guidance, do you think it's possible we could see flow through to the operating line and the bottom line along the lines of what we saw in the second \u2013 in the first half of the year?\nBob McMahon: Yes, the short answer on that, let me take the question around investment. The biggest investment that we have going forward is really the addition of the Resolution Bioscience business and continuing to invest behind the capabilities there both from an R&D and development perspective, as well as the channel. And so that that does have an outsized investment relative to the second half versus the first half where we didn't really have that in here, but we are continuing to invest in demand driving activities. Some of those things like we just talked about an ACG around the digital aspects, but also building capabilities to continue the momentum going forward, whether it'd be marketing programs and other activities within our R&D pipeline. And I think the last question that you had is, if we do have upside, will it drive the same kind of level of incrementals? And I would say the answer is yes.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay, super helpful. Thanks guys.\nBob McMahon: Yes, thanks Doug. Appreciate the comments.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Dan Leonard of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. So first off, on the core analytical business, do you think you've seen any benefits from on-shoring through the order book or the revenue line as of yet?\nMike McMullen: Dan. Hey, thanks for the question. Not yet. We've talked about it with you in prior quarters and we still think it's a area of interest of our customers in terms of future investment, but nothing material yet. This is the core kind of reinvestment happening in the chemical and materials side of C&E and as you heard in our prepared remarks, the order book actually was stronger than the revenue book. So, pointing to a recovery of this segment which, you know in passive and fairly cautious about in terms of calling it, but the trends are positive now.\nDan Leonard: Okay. And Mike, I want to ask a follow-up on Resolution Bio, you kind of assume this a build the future positive updates to come there. Can you talk about your [indiscernible] to invest in that business? And the reason I ask is, it does seem like a driver of success in that space is a willingness to absorb losses for long periods of time. So, can you talk about how you plan to invest in the business and how that fits your overall operating model? Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Yeah, I'm not sure I accept the premise that do you need to have huge operating losses to have the business depend on the type of play you're trying to make here. And Bob and Sam you guys, keep me honest here as well, but pharma services business model we have where we can leverage a lot of investments that we've already made around our IHC base CDx business, we're not in the same position increment there perhaps maybe start up some of it brand new entering the space. So, we have something to build from. So, I think our expense structure may look perhaps look different than others in this space. We do plan to invest aggressively on the R&D side as well, building out additional commercial relationships. But we think our plan has been to absorb within the overall operating model.  So, there wasn't any asterisk when we put our long-term goals out and said well without Res Bio, so I think we believe that we can manage within our overall operating model and I think given where we're starting from, which is we're not starting from zero in this business. We have something to build from our acquisition, a number of years ago from Darko. I think that puts us in a different perhaps a different place. Anything else add to that...\nDan Leonard: I appreciate the color. Okay, thank you.\nMike McMullen: You're welcome.\nOperator: Next question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nDerik de Bruin: Hi, sorry, had the mute on, sorry about that. So, can you talk a little bit more about the LCMS growth and the service going on there. And a couple of questions on that one. First of all, I've asked this question about are you seeing an accelerated replacement cycle in that market or any of your markets. Basically, are people feeling good about budgets. You're spending a little bit more than they had so that general question. And I guess one of your competitors has been talking about new LC platforms, particularly targeting the biologics area. I'm just sort of wondering what your sort of competitive response and product offerings are that will going against that? And then I've got one follow-up.\nMike McMullen: It's maybe there are competitive response. But I'm going to pass over to Jacob, because we're in the conference room here and I'm looking at him on the screen and he is finally loved to be able to answer your question. Derik. So, I'm going to pass it over to you, Jacob.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Thanks Mike. And, Derik this is great question. So thanks for that. First of all the \u2013 what the growth you're seeing both in our LC and LC/MS space is certainly not a coincidence, it is something we have invested in for quite some years. If you really think about our mass spec portfolio, we have really invested and innovated around the lines of robust reliable on the team and we really see our customers especially on our single and triple quads have really taken off here in the last period of time. I think even before in the food space, where we see a lot of upgrades into triple quads, but clearly in the pharma and biopharma space, we have doubled and tripled down on that, really, we can see that there's great opportunities there. So, when you move from small molecule things, the last molecule, we are also seeing that the customer base is changing and the customers or the users of the mass spec is changing and hence, they are looking for a different experience and we have invested quite a lot into our software platforms. First of all, to live up to the expectation from a regulatory perspective, but also from a usability. So that's a big part of our success in what we see and I truly believe there is a lot more to come in that area. If you look at the LC, investing into bio is a part of the game. We have had out at bio LC high end high LC for quite a while now and it is doing very well. We can compete about against everyone in this space and you will see us come out \u2013 continuously come out with new products in that space. So, we feel very good where we are, and we'll continue to invest to continue to keep tech market standards very important market for us.\nMike McMullen: And Derik, if I could just add on to that, I think it's fair to say Jacob, we're seeing both market expansion but also some acceleration of replacement market as well, particularly in pharma molecule.\nJacob Thaysen: Absolutely.\nDerik de Bruin: Great, thanks. And then I'm going to ask you an unfair question, but what the hell. And part of it goes like it is \u2013 this is like all the tools companies that put up really strong results, they're coming off of easier comps and that's great. But I think that everyone sort of focuses on the next fiscal year and the ability to grow earnings. I just sort of thought, can you sort of generally share any thoughts on sort of earnings growth next year and will it be in the double-digit range? Just your general thoughts right now as people are going to start worrying about the tough comps. Not the COVID tough comps and then other core tough comps.\nMike McMullen: So Bob and I haven't actually compared notes on this. I'll start with a few comments. And then I think we'll probably end been in the line. That said, potential U.S. tax reformer side, our model has been to be able to deliver double-digit EPS growth and I'm not seeing a need to deviate from that in 2022.\nBob McMahon: Agreed.\nDerik de Bruin: Okay. I appreciate it. Have a great day.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sykes: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just maybe in the category of too early, but just look at the growth rate that you guys have been showing in cell analysis. I'm just wondering if you can kind of give us an idea of contribution from that, just given \u2013 it's been integrated and growing at a pretty good clip. And then also, just sort of what you're seeing in terms of customer is largely new customers deepening relationships with existing customers. Just put more color on cell analysis? Thanks.\nMike McMullen: Sure, Matt, I think Bob kind of give a view on the overall size of the business and maybe pass it to you Jacob for some more insight on the customer side.\nBob McMahon: Yeah, I was going to say, Matt, we're extremely pleased with the performance really across all three of the major business groups within cell analysis really driving strong growth. And we are well on our way to continue to drive accelerated growth in those areas. And I would say the margin profile of that business is above the Agilent average. And so, I'll let Jacob actually talk about some of the areas where we continue to invest in new products such as the Cytation C10, but also some of the areas around customer acquisition and what we're doing in the marketplace.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, thanks. It's another great question. And as you can hear we are super excited about the cell analysis business, particularly I'll focus on live cell analysis by immuno-oncology and immunology as a whole. And as Bob has also mentioned, we have made some quite some good investments into that space, particularly in also the imaging space where we have recently come out with the Cytation C10. I think Bob also talked about that, which is a new confocal microscope and what it really does is that it allows we have build it and build it out this way that you can get a relatively good entry level microscope that will compete based on the market and then you can upgrade it and use all the other automation platform and configurations that we already have established in BioTek. So, it is a really mixed unmatched stat that our customers are really delighted about. And our customer base, of course, we enjoy a very strong installed base from the BioTek acquisition, which we are now leveraging also for [our Seahorse]. But we also see a much stronger push into the biopharma space where some of our businesses have been very exposed to the academia government and we had a very clear focus areas to move in that, and that works very well. So, we are very excited where we are but I would say that the main growth comes from the biopharma space, but clearly now with the academia government coming back that of course also across the growth.\nBob McMahon: Yes, Matt, just one other thing to add to what Jacob is saying. I mean this is an area that if you look at over the last several years, we continue to invest both organically and inorganically. And I would say, given our success in the strength in that marketplace and the strength of our portfolio, those are areas where we continue to look to invest further.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks for that. That's very helpful. And then just on Diagnostics. Your comment that you exit the quarter is stronger run rate. I'm sure some of that sort of catch-up demand from the COVID period, but just can you talk about the sustainability and your views on diagnostics throughout the rest of the year?\nSam Raha: Yes, that's one where we are \u2013 if we think about the opportunities, we're very, very pleased with kind of the progression of that business recovery throughout the course of the year. If you recall last year, we actually grew in that business and then saw a strong fall off when the pandemic really hit and we're expecting accelerated growth in Q3, but this is an area where we're watching to say, is there going to be sustained \u2013 how fast is that sustained recovery going. But all signs right now are very positive from the standpoint of the recovery, not only in our business, but if you look at just the overall testing environment continues to be very positive on non-COVID testing.  So, I think people are getting back into the doctors' for wellness tests, certainly diagnostic tests like cancer diagnostics and so forth, and I think we're seeing the benefit of that going forward. And then couple that with the addition of the Res Bio business and I think we've got a very compelling portfolio of opportunities to provide to our customers going forward.\nMatt Sykes: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Puneet Souda of SVBL. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, hi. Thanks, Mike and Bob. Bob question for you first. What are you baking in for pricing expectations for the year? And I think the bigger question here is, your ability to take pricing in the market in case there is a rise in raw material prices and in-line with the expectations? And then I have a follow-up for Jacob and Sam.\nBob McMahon: That's a great question, Puneet, and what I would say is, first of all, just a shout out to our OFS team, our supply chain organization, who've just done a fantastic job of being able to manage the increased demands on a increasingly fragile supply chain or logistics, I would say. And so they've just done a fantastic job of supporting our customers. And as you say, we are starting to see inflationary pressures in these areas, but I would say, you know our contracts are more long-term in nature and the teams have been able to drive with the volume, as well as continued discussions, good cost controls there at least in the near term. And on pricing, our pricing hasn't changed. We felt that we had modest price built into our plan. That's what we've seen through this first half of the year and that's what we're assuming in the second half of the year. It depends on what group, but overall, we hadn't built any expectation of significant price increase or decreases into our business.\nPuneet Souda: Okay, that's helpful. And then a quick one for Sam first and then other one for Jacob. Sam, if you could characterize what are your expectations with the pipeline in terms of MRD, beyond therapy management for Resolution Biosciences, and if you could also talk a little bit about the regulatory framework? In past you followed PDL1 pharmDx assays into FDA approvals. How should we think about the new product launches? Are they going to follow a similar path?  And then for Jacob briefly, could you update us briefly on the Open Lab efforts and your position in pharma there, obviously with your competitor now being focused again on the \u2013 very much on the core LC position. I'm wondering if you're seeing any changes in the market and I totally appreciate your 1,100 and 1,200 LCs has done well, but I just want to get a sense of Open Lab. Thank you very much and congrats again on the quarter.\nBob McMahon: Yeah, thank you for the question on the Resolution Bio, I think \u2026\nMike McMullen: How many questions in there.\nSam Raha: Quick response for you. Our primary focus remains therapy selection and that's where the programs that we have contracted and the continued significant interest we're seeing both from our existing pharma partners on the Agilent side, as well as the Resolution clientele that are coming into our pipeline as well. Now the fundamental technology is, we do believe the minimal to more applications including minimum residual disease and monitoring, but once again our primary focus remains therapy selection. Now, in terms of the model, I think you asked about that. It is what we can do before, which is we believe as Agilent, we've got a capability set, which we've used for PDL1 where we work, specifically with pharma partners to work on companion diagnostics meaning to develop register and then commercialize those companion diagnostics as they come to market and are approved, tied to a specific indication specific drugs. So that is our model and ultimately our vision is to have IVD kitted NGS solutions that are near to patients that are distributable, but of course as you heard even earlier we've got a CLIA lab and there's diagnostic testing that will happen along the way, and that's a little bit different than the PDL1 model that we have today, because that's the nature of NGS based diagnostic testing, but our interest and long-term focus remains an IVD kitted diagnostic test. Jacob, over to you.\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah. Thank you and let me just start by saying that Informatics and Open Lab is key to our strategy. So, though we like to talk about our instrument, it's always connected \u2013 most of the time connected within a very strong position in Informatics, and we continue to invest in Open Lab, in fact, we believe that is the lab, where we connect all our instruments into an ecosystem in a cloud setup where you can also track your samples and in the end also connect into an e-commerce set up is going to be the future, and with Agilent's broad portfolio we can very quickly, we can very well do this. So, I'm very excited about that and we continue to invest, in fact we have over the last few months decided to further invest into these areas to further accelerate our presence here.\nPuneet Souda: That's great. I appreciate you guys taking that extra questions. Thanks guys.\nMike McMullen: Sure not a problem.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Couillard: Thanks, good afternoon. Bob or Mike in terms of the chemical energy business, could you break out instruments versus aftermarket in the quarter? I suspect it's probably the first quarter in a while that you've seen solid instrument growth. Just wanted to confirm that's the case. And then what's embedded in terms of the updated full-year guide for that end markets specifically?\nMike McMullen: Bob, I know that the instrument business was strong for us in C&E. I can't remember the actual relative ratios of [indiscernible]. We're looking though our notes here right now to answer your question. And going into the Q3 is probably our easiest compare in C&E. We're still looking for that stack growth to kind of move up bit on us, but Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes, I was going to say, Brandon to your point of that [14%] LSAG or the instrument business is slightly higher than that and LSAG was slightly lower than that, but both double-digit growth. And as we think about where we are going forward in terms of the guide for the third quarter and it kind of going forward, our assumption for Q3 is somewhat similar to Q2 in terms of continued recovery of a weak base. It was down 10% again last Q3 and then we started seeing recovery. And so I think about it \u2013 we're thinking about it in roughly the same kind of terms in Q3 that we saw in Q2.\nMike McMullen: I think right now we're taking it quarter-by-quarter, Bob. But I think overall we see this trending being more upside than downside.\nBob McMahon: That's right.\nBrandon Couillard: Got you. And then just one more, it doesn't sound like, based on your prepared remarks today, but to what extent if at all are you seeing any supply constraints, printed circuit boards or other marked materials?\nMike McMullen: Brandon, I just would echo what Bob mentioned earlier, our office team that is on a spectacular job, so in our remarks you heard we talked about some strong orders, order growth higher in China and C&E, but that was not at all tied to any supply chain constraints. So, we've been able to get product. We've been able to ship product and listen, it's not easy, but the teams find a way to make it happen. So, I think Bob is relatively material at all to the quarter and we think it's manageable moving forward as well.\nBob McMahon: That's right.\nBrandon Couillard: Great, thanks.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Patrick Donnelly of Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Great, thanks for taking the questions guys. Maybe following-up on Brandon's question on C&E there, can you just talk through what you're seeing in there a bit more? Obviously, the order book growth is encouraging coming in higher than revenue. You know, was that enough to give you confidence that this won't kind of turn quickly on you? I know you've noted historically it's been a bit hesitant to bake in too much growth there. I mean this is among the most positive [indiscernible] I\u2019ve heard from you guys over the past couple of years. So, can you just talk through that and then I guess was that segment the biggest piece [recovering the back half] guidance raise doing a bit more comfortable about the sustainability there?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. And I'm glad you remember my earlier comments, because I always said once the orders here in my book I'll start to talk a little bit differently about it and that's why you're getting more positive tone. I would say that we're still in the early phases of the transition. We feel really good about where things are on the chemical materials side of C&E. I would say we're starting to see quoting and some initial order activity on the refining side still relatively light compared to the Materials and Chemicals segments. As you know, the larger part of that business for us, but yes we are \u2013 I am much more positive. I think it's probably the first time in a long time that we've had this kind of view on the trends we're seeing in the C&E space. And yes, we had in prior quarters seamless PMIs, but I wanted to see in the order book and I started to see it this quarter.\nBob McMahon: And I would say, Patrick to build on what Mike is saying, we still have \u2013 we're taking it as he said, kind of, one quarter at a time. We've built in some of that into Q3 and I would still say there is a bias to the upside in Q4.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay, that's helpful. And then just maybe on the M&A landscape. Bob, you mentioned the balance sheet helped, obviously we saw the Resolution deal you guys touched on that a few times. Should we expect more deals of that nature? Are you still on the hunt for something a bit larger? Mike, maybe if you could talk a little bit about the pipeline activity and the segments you're focused on and then Bob, if you want to talk about where the leverage could go, that will certainly be appreciated.\nMike McMullen: Yes. So I think our view on M&A remains the same. We see that as a key part of our \u2013 we've been terming our build and buy growth strategy. We've signaled that we would be willing to do deals in the multiples of BioTek, which to date is our largest deal. And that's still an area of interest for us. We like to, kind of a growth accretive deals that you're seeing. We're bringing in great new teams like Res Bio team, like the BioTek, ACEA, so we are maintaining our focus on higher growth segments. We like the areas we're going, we've been gone after. We like cell analysis, we like the genomics look at biopsy space, I think Informatics others. We have a number of areas that we were continuing to look for growth opportunities. Again, we don't have to do deals to make our model work. But if we can find great new teams and great businesses to bring into the company we're quite willing to do that. You just have to remain disciplined in terms of valuation expectations. There's a lot of frothiness in certain segments of the market, but we're going to stay where we've been successful in the private space, where company founders often looked at and say listen, this will be a great home for my company my team. We like how you guys run your company, we like your culture, we like to just for in terms of growing the business for the long-term. So, we're going to stick to our model. It\u2019s been working for us Bob and I think we can adjust the question...\nBob McMahon: Just quickly, we're not going to give a specific target around that other than to say that our intent is to maintain an investment grade and we ended the quarter at, kind of 1 times net leverage and that gives us plenty of flexibility to continue to invest in deals growth accretive deals as Mike just talked about.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. Thanks, Mike and Bob, really appreciate it.\nMike McMullen: You're very welcome.\nOperator: And your last question today will come from Dan Brennan of UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi this is [Nathan] on for Dan. Just a quick question. To what extent has your upgrade cycle been impacted by the pandemic, and now that we're kind of coming out of the pandemic, are you seeing any traction, any acceleration in the upgrade cycle in any of your instruments or end market?\nMike McMullen: Yes, I think to answer your question, I think when the pandemic hit, it really slowed down any kind of replacement cycle. Particularly I would say in the C&E side of our business. And as we just commented, we're seeing positive indications that that actually is now turning to different direction. So, I'd say it's been even in the C&E space that are tied to chromatography spectroscopy platforms.\nBob McMahon: I would say, Nathan as Mike said, still early days, but all the trends are looking positive.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And just, if I can switch [pharma], you did mention that you're seeing share gains on top end market grow. Can you just elaborate what is driving share gains for you?\nMike McMullen: If you think about our \u2013 the combination of our LSAG and ACG businesses where we come in the analytical lab, as Jacob mentioned earlier and I haven't had a chance to have [indiscernible] jump into the call yet, but you know they\u2019ve been working very well together for multiple years. And you're seeing it by bringing innovative solutions to the market that have a differentiated value proposition from the competition. A superior service experience and I think it's \u2013 we continue to build out our commercial reach as well. So, I think it's been the combination of portfolio and the workflow focus within that portfolio, building the service capability and then building out further commercial reach. I think it's been a combination of all those factors helping us to do really well in our LSAG and ACG groups, and then obviously we talked earlier about the play in cell analysis, which is a new addition to the company in biopharma, and then our NASD play in Sam's business. I think it's been a combination of all those factors. So, that's why we keep using the word broad-based growth because you see it in all parts of the businesses. So, we feel really good about the results from the size we were working on for a while.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you everyone for joining us. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sam Raha",
            "content": "Yes. Thanks Mike. Thanks for the question, Tycho. Yes, it was very exciting to finally get out and see real human beings again and very exciting to see the enthusiasm of the team there. And first-hand what is now part of our company. And Tycho the specific answer is, both parts are important. The primary business today that we have in Resolution Bio is related to pharma services, very much akin to what we do in our traditional CDx business here at Agilent, it's working with pharma to better understand biomarkers and then to develop companion diagnostics, which will [ultimately block] the market. There is some testing that's done in the CLIA lab as you mentioned, there is a relationship with LabCorp, and that is something that we expect over time to ramp, both because of the testing for LabCorp and also testing that will result from actual companion diagnostics that are approved as part of the former work that we're doing, but both are important, but the substantial part of our revenue today in this year, and even in the coming 18 months, 24 months will continue to be some pharma services revenue. Yes, that's one where we are \u2013 if we think about the opportunities, we're very, very pleased with kind of the progression of that business recovery throughout the course of the year. If you recall last year, we actually grew in that business and then saw a strong fall off when the pandemic really hit and we're expecting accelerated growth in Q3, but this is an area where we're watching to say, is there going to be sustained \u2013 how fast is that sustained recovery going. But all signs right now are very positive from the standpoint of the recovery, not only in our business, but if you look at just the overall testing environment continues to be very positive on non-COVID testing.  So, I think people are getting back into the doctors' for wellness tests, certainly diagnostic tests like cancer diagnostics and so forth, and I think we're seeing the benefit of that going forward. And then couple that with the addition of the Res Bio business and I think we've got a very compelling portfolio of opportunities to provide to our customers going forward. Quick response for you. Our primary focus remains therapy selection and that's where the programs that we have contracted and the continued significant interest we're seeing both from our existing pharma partners on the Agilent side, as well as the Resolution clientele that are coming into our pipeline as well. Now the fundamental technology is, we do believe the minimal to more applications including minimum residual disease and monitoring, but once again our primary focus remains therapy selection. Now, in terms of the model, I think you asked about that. It is what we can do before, which is we believe as Agilent, we've got a capability set, which we've used for PDL1 where we work, specifically with pharma partners to work on companion diagnostics meaning to develop register and then commercialize those companion diagnostics as they come to market and are approved, tied to a specific indication specific drugs. So that is our model and ultimately our vision is to have IVD kitted NGS solutions that are near to patients that are distributable, but of course as you heard even earlier we've got a CLIA lab and there's diagnostic testing that will happen along the way, and that's a little bit different than the PDL1 model that we have today, because that's the nature of NGS based diagnostic testing, but our interest and long-term focus remains an IVD kitted diagnostic test. Jacob, over to you."

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks, Ruben, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. Before I get into the quarterly details, I want to start by recognizing our Agilent India team. Despite the challenging COVID-19 situation, our India team is working closely with our customers to do what we can to help in this time of extreme need. In addition, our Agilent India customer support, finance, and IT teams have worked tirelessly to help us close out the second quarter and keep us moving forward. I could not be more proud of how the team has worked together in true \u2018One Agilent\u2019 fashion. Our thoughts go out to the entire Agilent India team and their families during this difficult time. In Q2, the strong momentum in our business continues against the backdrop of a recovering market. The Agilent team delivered another outstanding quarter exceeding our expectations. Both revenue and earnings are up sharply versus a solid Q2 last year, when revenues and earnings per share were relatively flat. Our growth is broad-based across all business groups, markets, and geographies. We also expanded margins, driving faster earnings per share growth. Revenues for the quarter are $1.525 billion. This is up 23% on a reported basis and up 19% core. COVID-19 related revenues account for roughly 2% of overall revenues as expected and contributed about a point to our overall growth. Our revenue growth is not a one quarter or easy compare story, but one of sustained above market growth. For example, our Q2 revenues are up more than 17% core from two years ago. Q2 operating margins are 23.9%. This is up 150 basis points. EPS of $0.97 is up 37% year-over-year. Late in the quarter, we also welcomed the Resolution Bioscience team to Agilent, continuing our investments in high-growth markets and bringing outstanding talent into Agilent. Like our recent acquisitions in cell analysis, Resolution Bioscience is an example of our build and buy growth strategy in action. The Agilent story remains the same. It is a story of one team outpacing the market to deliver strong, broad based growth in an environment of a continuing market recovery. Moving on to our end-market highlights, we grew strongly in all markets. Our growth is led by 29% growth in pharma and 22% in food. We are seeing improving growth in the chemical and energy market with 14% growth. We also posted low teens growth in diagnostics and over 20% growth in academia and government. Lastly, environmental and forensics grew 8%. Bob will provide more end-market detail later in his comments. Geographically, the Americas led the way with 27% growth. Strength in China, Europe and the rest of Asia continues with all growing in the mid-teens. The 13% growth in China is on top of 4% growth last year when the business started to recover from the pandemic. As we look at our performance by business group, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $674 million during the quarter. LSAG is up 28% on a reported basis and up 25% core, off a 7% decline last year. LSAG\u2019s growth is broad-based, across all end-markets and geographies. Our focus and investments in fast growing end markets continues to pay off. The LSAG pharma business is very strong, growing 41% with strength in both biopharma and small molecule. From a product perspective, we saw strength in liquid chromatography and LCMS along with continued growth in cell analysis. During the quarter, cell analysis grew 34%, with our BioTek business growing close to 40%. During the quarter, the LSAG team also contributed to our long-term company-wide focus on sustainability in advancing important ESG initiatives. LSAG announced several new products that have earned the highly respected Accountability, Consistency, and Transparency, ACT Label from My Green Lab. My Green Lab is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the sustainability of scientific research. LSAG products also received two Scientists' Choice Awards announced at the SelectScience Virtual Analytical Summit. In our cell analysis business during the quarter, we launched our Cytation 10 Confocal Imaging Reader, a multi-functional automated system focused on research labs and core facilities looking for increased productivity. This product builds on the BioTek cell imaging leadership with the Cytation multi-mode reader and expands our reach in this strategic business. While still early, customer feedback has been extremely positive. We are also very pleased with the progress and trajectory of our cell analysis business overall and see a very positive future for this space. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $536 million. This is up a reported 19% and up 15% on a core basis versus a 1% increase last year. ACG\u2019s growth is driven by demand for consumables and services across the portfolio as lab activity continues to increase for our customers. This is leading to more on-demand services and parts consumption. Revenues from our contract business continue to drive strong growth due to the high level of contract renewals seen in the previous quarter. Our strong instrument placements and the increasing installed base will benefit the ACG business going forward. At the same time, our digital investments continue to pay off with continued strong customer uptake in consumables and our digitally enabled service offerings. Our LSAG and ACG business has come together in the analytical lab. This is where we believe we are well-positioned to continue driving above market growth as we build on our market leading portfolio, strong service organization, and outstanding customer service. For the Diagnostics and Genomics Group, revenues were $315 million, up 20% reported and up 16% core versus a 5% increase last year. Growth is broad-based, led by our NASD oligo and genomics businesses. Demand for our NASD offerings remains strong and our capacity expansion plans for our high-growth NASD business remain on-track. We\u2019re very pleased with our acquisition of Resolution Bioscience during the quarter. With their liquid biopsy technology, Resolution Bioscience is a key player in a very exciting area of cancer diagnostics. We are very glad to have them on the Agilent team. I\u2019m confident that as time goes on, you will be hearing more and more from us on this business and its contributions. I would now like to recap the second quarter and take a look forward. The strong momentum in our business continues. This is being driven by our relentless customer focus, the strength of our portfolio and the execution capability of the One Agilent team. Our build and buy growth strategy is delivering, as intended, with above-market growth. Over the last year, I have often said that Agilent is focused on coming out of the pandemic even stronger as a company. I believe you\u2019re seeing the impact of this approach in our current results. As we look ahead, we do so with a sense of both optimism and confidence. We are optimistic because of the continued market recovery and the strength of our portfolio. We are confident because we have the right team, customer focused, operationally excellent and driven to win. As a result, we are once again raising our full-year revenue and earnings guidance. Bob will share more details, but we are expecting a continuation of our excellent top line growth. We also expect to convert this strong top line into excellent earnings growth and cash generation. During our investor event in December, we discussed our shareholder value creation model and our goals for increasing long-term growth and expanding margins. Six months into fiscal 2021, we are well on our way to achieving those objectives. Our build and buy growth strategy is delivering. The One Agilent team continues to demonstrate its execution prowess and strong drive to win. We\u2019ve raised the bar on customer service and continue to exceed customer expectations in providing industry-leading products and services. While we have yet to fully emerge from the global pandemic, we are looking forward to the future with both optimism and confidence. Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Yes, there was a lot to unpack there Vijay. I'll take the congratulations Vijay and I'll pass the [indiscernible] to Bob. No. Yes, we're extremely pleased with the results that we've seen in the pharma business really across all three of our end business groups. I think it shows the investments in the great execution by the team that has been paying off over the last several years and I think what you're seeing is not only a market recovery for sure, but I think the relevance of our portfolio across all three of our business groups in that business, and certainly we are benefiting from the investments to expand capacity and new therapeutics across various end markets. But I also think the number of new products that we have launched in this space are really seeing a nice uptake. And on NASD to your point, I mean, we saw nice growth in NASD was in the high 30s and we are still on track for that $200 million that you talked about. And feel very good about that business going forward. Hey Bob, maybe if I can start with some comments? So, I think if there has been a positive on COVID, I think it's actually stimulating to some increased levels of investments in some of these end markets. So, we think that that some of these growth rates we've seen from the markets perspective are sustainable for a while. And we mentioned earlier, our story is a core business story. We've been very pleased that our team has been able to participate and have a role here to play in the fight against COVID-19, but our story really is all about what we're doing in terms of driving the core business. Yes. Tycho thanks for the question and good afternoon. I'll make a few comments here and I'll pass it over to Sam. So, my comments are going to be, we're very excited about having Resolution Bioscience team as part of Agilent. And Sam, I think we were even becoming even more excited now that we've had even a deeper look about what's been going on with the company and I think you've just come back from a visit from with the team. So you've had a chance of our \u2013 because maybe perhaps your first face to face business trip in well over a year, but with that lead in, why don't I pass over to you and answer Tycho's question. Yeah. That's the focus. Yes, sure. You're close study on the numbers, I can see it Tycho, so thanks for two good questions. So, while we're super pleased with the overall growth rate of food, it's been a story here for a number of quarters. We don't expect it to be a 20% growth rate in 2022 and years beyond, but we are expecting continued strength throughout this year, probably not at that same level. And Bob, I think it's really a \u2013 clinically China is part of that story, but in fact, when we look across the globe, it's been a \u2013 we also saw strength in other geographies as well. And I don't have exact... Geographic split, but it was a broad-based kind of story, with China leading the way, being the key part but not the only part of the story. Bob I just want to add one thing. Additional thought in the Americas, historically that's been a lower growth rate for us in food. But with the inclusion of the cannabis testing market we're getting a bit of a bump there as well. Absolutely. You're welcome. Dan. Hey, thanks for the question. Not yet. We've talked about it with you in prior quarters and we still think it's a area of interest of our customers in terms of future investment, but nothing material yet. This is the core kind of reinvestment happening in the chemical and materials side of C&E and as you heard in our prepared remarks, the order book actually was stronger than the revenue book. So, pointing to a recovery of this segment which, you know in passive and fairly cautious about in terms of calling it, but the trends are positive now. Yeah, I'm not sure I accept the premise that do you need to have huge operating losses to have the business depend on the type of play you're trying to make here. And Bob and Sam you guys, keep me honest here as well, but pharma services business model we have where we can leverage a lot of investments that we've already made around our IHC base CDx business, we're not in the same position increment there perhaps maybe start up some of it brand new entering the space. So, we have something to build from. So, I think our expense structure may look perhaps look different than others in this space. We do plan to invest aggressively on the R&D side as well, building out additional commercial relationships. But we think our plan has been to absorb within the overall operating model.  So, there wasn't any asterisk when we put our long-term goals out and said well without Res Bio, so I think we believe that we can manage within our overall operating model and I think given where we're starting from, which is we're not starting from zero in this business. We have something to build from our acquisition, a number of years ago from Darko. I think that puts us in a different perhaps a different place. Anything else add to that... You're welcome. It's maybe there are competitive response. But I'm going to pass over to Jacob, because we're in the conference room here and I'm looking at him on the screen and he is finally loved to be able to answer your question. Derik. So, I'm going to pass it over to you, Jacob. And Derik, if I could just add on to that, I think it's fair to say Jacob, we're seeing both market expansion but also some acceleration of replacement market as well, particularly in pharma molecule. So Bob and I haven't actually compared notes on this. I'll start with a few comments. And then I think we'll probably end been in the line. That said, potential U.S. tax reformer side, our model has been to be able to deliver double-digit EPS growth and I'm not seeing a need to deviate from that in 2022. Sure, Matt, I think Bob kind of give a view on the overall size of the business and maybe pass it to you Jacob for some more insight on the customer side. How many questions in there. Sure not a problem. Bob, I know that the instrument business was strong for us in C&E. I can't remember the actual relative ratios of [indiscernible]. We're looking though our notes here right now to answer your question. And going into the Q3 is probably our easiest compare in C&E. We're still looking for that stack growth to kind of move up bit on us, but Bob? I think right now we're taking it quarter-by-quarter, Bob. But I think overall we see this trending being more upside than downside. Brandon, I just would echo what Bob mentioned earlier, our office team that is on a spectacular job, so in our remarks you heard we talked about some strong orders, order growth higher in China and C&E, but that was not at all tied to any supply chain constraints. So, we've been able to get product. We've been able to ship product and listen, it's not easy, but the teams find a way to make it happen. So, I think Bob is relatively material at all to the quarter and we think it's manageable moving forward as well. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. And I'm glad you remember my earlier comments, because I always said once the orders here in my book I'll start to talk a little bit differently about it and that's why you're getting more positive tone. I would say that we're still in the early phases of the transition. We feel really good about where things are on the chemical materials side of C&E. I would say we're starting to see quoting and some initial order activity on the refining side still relatively light compared to the Materials and Chemicals segments. As you know, the larger part of that business for us, but yes we are \u2013 I am much more positive. I think it's probably the first time in a long time that we've had this kind of view on the trends we're seeing in the C&E space. And yes, we had in prior quarters seamless PMIs, but I wanted to see in the order book and I started to see it this quarter. Yes. So I think our view on M&A remains the same. We see that as a key part of our \u2013 we've been terming our build and buy growth strategy. We've signaled that we would be willing to do deals in the multiples of BioTek, which to date is our largest deal. And that's still an area of interest for us.

We have a number of areas that we were continuing to look for growth opportunities. Again, we don't have to do deals to make our model work. But if we can find great new teams and great businesses to bring into the company we're quite willing to do that. You just have to remain disciplined in terms of valuation expectations.

We like how you guys run your company, we like your culture, we like to just for in terms of growing the business for the long-term. So, we're going to stick to our model. It\u2019s been working for us Bob and I think we can adjust the question... You're very welcome. Yes, I think to answer your question, I think when the pandemic hit, it really slowed down any kind of replacement cycle. Particularly I would say in the C&E side of our business. And as we just commented, we're seeing positive indications that that actually is now turning to different direction. So, I'd say it's been even in the C&E space that are tied to chromatography spectroscopy platforms. If you think about our \u2013 the combination of our LSAG and ACG businesses where we come in the analytical lab, as Jacob mentioned earlier and I haven't had a chance to have [indiscernible] jump into the call yet, but you know they\u2019ve been working very well together for multiple years. And you're seeing it by bringing innovative solutions to the market that have a differentiated value proposition from the competition.

            "content": "Yes. Thanks Mike. And, Derik this is great question. So thanks for that. First of all the \u2013 what the growth you're seeing both in our LC and LC/MS space is certainly not a coincidence, it is something we have invested in for quite some years. If you really think about our mass spec portfolio, we have really invested and innovated around the lines of robust reliable on the team and we really see our customers especially on our single and triple quads have really taken off here in the last period of time. I think even before in the food space, where we see a lot of upgrades into triple quads, but clearly in the pharma and biopharma space, we have doubled and tripled down on that, really, we can see that there's great opportunities there. So, when you move from small molecule things, the last molecule, we are also seeing that the customer base is changing and the customers or the users of the mass spec is changing and hence, they are looking for a different experience and we have invested quite a lot into our software platforms. First of all, to live up to the expectation from a regulatory perspective, but also from a usability. So that's a big part of our success in what we see and I truly believe there is a lot more to come in that area. If you look at the LC, investing into bio is a part of the game. We have had out at bio LC high end high LC for quite a while now and it is doing very well. We can compete about against everyone in this space and you will see us come out \u2013 continuously come out with new products in that space. So, we feel very good where we are, and we'll continue to invest to continue to keep tech market standards very important market for us. Absolutely. Yes, thanks. It's another great question. And as you can hear we are super excited about the cell analysis business, particularly I'll focus on live cell analysis by immuno-oncology and immunology as a whole. And as Bob has also mentioned, we have made some quite some good investments into that space, particularly in also the imaging space where we have recently come out with the Cytation C10. I think Bob also talked about that, which is a new confocal microscope and what it really does is that it allows we have build it and build it out this way that you can get a relatively good entry level microscope that will compete based on the market and then you can upgrade it and use all the other automation platform and configurations that we already have established in BioTek. So, it is a really mixed unmatched stat that our customers are really delighted about. And our customer base, of course, we enjoy a very strong installed base from the BioTek acquisition, which we are now leveraging also for [our Seahorse]. But we also see a much stronger push into the biopharma space where some of our businesses have been very exposed to the academia government and we had a very clear focus areas to move in that, and that works very well. So, we are very excited where we are but I would say that the main growth comes from the biopharma space, but clearly now with the academia government coming back that of course also across the growth. Yeah. Thank you and let me just start by saying that Informatics and Open Lab is key to our strategy. So, though we like to talk about our instrument, it's always connected \u2013 most of the time connected within a very strong position in Informatics, and we continue to invest in Open Lab, in fact, we believe that is the lab, where we connect all our instruments into an ecosystem in a cloud setup where you can also track your samples and in the end also connect into an e-commerce set up is going to be the future, and with Agilent's broad portfolio we can very quickly, we can very well do this. So, I'm very excited about that and we continue to invest, in fact we have over the last few months decided to further invest into these areas to further accelerate our presence here."

Revenue for the second quarter was $1.525 billion, reflecting reported growth of 23%. Core revenue growth was 19%, while currency contributed just under 4 points of growth. We are very pleased with our second quarter results as we saw strong, broad based growth with all three business groups posting mid-teens growth or higher, and all end markets growing strongly. From an end-market perspective, our focus on fast growing markets is paying off. Pharma, our largest market, again led the way, delivering 29% growth. This is on top of growing 5% last year. Growth was led by cell analysis, LC, and Mass Spec. These tools are delivering critical capabilities to our Bio-Pharma customers as they continue to make investments to develop new therapies and vaccines. Our biopharma business grew roughly 40% and represented over 35% of our pharma business in the quarter. Our small molecule segment also has momentum, growing in the mid-20s in the quarter. Overall, we are well-positioned within pharma and expect the pharma market to continue being the strongest end-market as we enter the second half of the year. The food market continued its strong performance, growing 22%. We experienced strong growth across all regions and segments as we continue to see global investments across the entire food supply-chain. We were very pleased to see the non-COVID diagnostics businesses continue to improve throughout the quarter growing 13% as routine doctor visits returned closer to pre-pandemic levels. We posted a very strong month in the diagnostics and clinical market as we came to anniversary the weak April we experienced in our large markets at the onset of the pandemic last year. And we exited the quarter with testing volumes at a run rate slightly higher than pre-pandemic levels. The chemical and energy end-market continues to recover as we grew 14% off a decline of 10% last year. Our results were primarily driven by continued strength in the chemicals and materials markets. And in a positive sign, our order growth rates were ahead of revenues and finished the quarter strong, leading us to believe this trend will continue. We also saw a nice recovery in the academia and government market as non-COVID-related labs resume operations in a strong funding environment. With the increase in activity, our business grew 21% against the weakest comparison of the year. We would expect the academia and government market to continue to recover throughout the rest of the year. Lastly, the environmental and forensics market saw high single-digit growth driven by the Americas, services and consumables, and atomic spectroscopy. On a geographic basis, all regions grew, led by the Americas at 27%. The pharma and academia and government markets in Americas grew in the low 30% range and all markets grew at least 20%. Europe experienced 16% growth led by food, academia, and government, and C&E. Those three markets all grew more than 20%. And as Mike noted, China grew 13% after growing 4% last year. This was driven by pharma growth in the high 30s. Our growth in orders outpaced revenue growth by mid-single digits during the quarter. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, second quarter gross margin was 55.4%, flat year-on-year despite a headwind of more than 30 basis points from currency. Our operating margin for the second quarter came in at 23.9%. Driven by volume, this is up a solid 150 basis points from last year even as we saw increased spending as activity ramped and we invest in the future. Strong top line growth coupled with our operating leverage helped deliver EPS of $0.97, up 37% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75% and share count was 307 million shares.  Now, on to cash flow and the balance sheet. Our performance translated into very strong cash flows. We delivered $472 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, up more than 50% from last year. This strong cash flow has continued to help drive our balanced capital deployment strategy. During the quarter, we retuned $254 million to our shareholders, paying out $59 million in dividends, and repurchasing 1.55 million shares for $195 million. And as Mike mentioned, we also continue to strategically invest in the business. We spent a net of $547 million to purchase Resolution Bioscience and invested $31 million in capital expenditures. Year to-date, we\u2019ve returned $657 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while re-investing in the business by spending $619 million on M&A and capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, which enables us to enjoy financial flexibility going forward.  During the quarter, we raised $850 million in long term debt at very favorable terms, redeemed $300 million that was maturing next year and reduced our ongoing interest expense. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash, $2.9 billion in outstanding debt and a net leverage ratio of 1X. Now, turning to the outlook for the full-year and the third quarter, we see great opportunity to build on our strong first half results. Looking forward, while the pandemic is still with us, we continue to see recovery in our end-markets and have solid momentum in all our businesses. As a result, we\u2019re again increasing our full-year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. This reflects our strong Q2 results and increasing expectations for the second half of the year. We are also incorporating the Resolution Bioscience into our new guidance. For revenue, we are increasing our full-year to a range of $6.15 billion to $6.21 billion, up nearly $320 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 15% to 16% and core growth of 12% to 13%. Included is roughly 3 points of currency and about a half-point attributable to M&A. This increased outlook also reflects continued growth in our end-markets. We see sustained momentum in the second half of the year in the pharma, food, and environmental and forensic markets. End markets that we expect will continue to recover in the second half include diagnostics and clinical, academic and government, and C&E. As Mike mentioned during our investor event in December, we provided a long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Our updated guidance for the year exceeds the top end of that range. In addition, we are increasing our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $4.09 to $4.14 per share. This is growth of 25% to 26% for the year. Now for the third fiscal quarter, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.51 million to $1.54 billion, representing reported growth of 20% to 22% and core growth of 15% to 17.5%. And we expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.97 to $0.99 per share with growth of 24% to 27%. Now, before opening the call for questions, I want to say, we\u2019re extremely pleased with how we\u2019ve started the first half of the year. We believe our strategies and our execution are driving the strong results we\u2019ve achieved and put us in a great position to continue to drive strong results for the remainder of the year. With that, Ruben back to you for Q&A. And my perspective, I think we're capturing share in a faster growing market. So, I think there is a combination of both above expectations on market growth, but we're also getting more than our fair share of that market. Yes, that's right. Yes, absolutely, Tycho to Mike's point I think we see this kind of reverting back over time, but certainly what we're seeing is increased investment and increased testing here really around the globe. And China was actually slightly lower than the overall core business, you saw a strong recovery both in Americas and Europe and the Rest of Asia. And I think we're seeing some halo effect of COVID testing kind of a surveillance testing in various aspects of China or of food testing. And so, I think we feel very good about the business there. And then I think on your question... Yes, thanks. Thanks Mike. And I think what you're seeing in the ACG business Tycho, is a combination of two things. One is some reinvestment, we continue to double down in areas like the digital investments to continue to increase our capabilities there and then you did see some increased activity, and so as we actually see this is a good thing. Our sales and field service engineers are traveling to more customers. And so, we're seeing some increases there associated with just increased activity, which we saw on the on-demand side, but it also comes with some incremental cost. But long-term, we feel very good about our ACG business and continued ability to scale that business going forward. No, I think you are reading the numbers very well, Doug. And what I would say is, certainly, we feel very good about Q3 and that's where we have most of our visibility. We still are in a pandemic, but we feel good about the recovery and our \u2013 I think still a little prudent in terms of our forecast going forward. We want to see how the continued rollout of the vaccines are around the world and I think there isn't anything that in the near term that we see is going to stop us from our momentum. But your math on the fly is pretty good Doug. Yes, the short answer on that, let me take the question around investment. The biggest investment that we have going forward is really the addition of the Resolution Bioscience business and continuing to invest behind the capabilities there both from an R&D and development perspective, as well as the channel. And so that that does have an outsized investment relative to the second half versus the first half where we didn't really have that in here, but we are continuing to invest in demand driving activities. Some of those things like we just talked about an ACG around the digital aspects, but also building capabilities to continue the momentum going forward, whether it'd be marketing programs and other activities within our R&D pipeline. And I think the last question that you had is, if we do have upside, will it drive the same kind of level of incrementals? And I would say the answer is yes. Yes, thanks Doug. Appreciate the comments. Agreed. Yeah, I was going to say, Matt, we're extremely pleased with the performance really across all three of the major business groups within cell analysis really driving strong growth. And we are well on our way to continue to drive accelerated growth in those areas. And I would say the margin profile of that business is above the Agilent average. And so, I'll let Jacob actually talk about some of the areas where we continue to invest in new products such as the Cytation C10, but also some of the areas around customer acquisition and what we're doing in the marketplace. Yes, Matt, just one other thing to add to what Jacob is saying. I mean this is an area that if you look at over the last several years, we continue to invest both organically and inorganically. And I would say, given our success in the strength in that marketplace and the strength of our portfolio, those are areas where we continue to look to invest further. That's a great question, Puneet, and what I would say is, first of all, just a shout out to our OFS team, our supply chain organization, who've just done a fantastic job of being able to manage the increased demands on a increasingly fragile supply chain or logistics, I would say. And so they've just done a fantastic job of supporting our customers. And as you say, we are starting to see inflationary pressures in these areas, but I would say, you know our contracts are more long-term in nature and the teams have been able to drive with the volume, as well as continued discussions, good cost controls there at least in the near term. And on pricing, our pricing hasn't changed. We felt that we had modest price built into our plan. That's what we've seen through this first half of the year and that's what we're assuming in the second half of the year. It depends on what group, but overall, we hadn't built any expectation of significant price increase or decreases into our business. Yeah, thank you for the question on the Resolution Bio, I think \u2026 Yes, I was going to say, Brandon to your point of that [14%] LSAG or the instrument business is slightly higher than that and LSAG was slightly lower than that, but both double-digit growth. And as we think about where we are going forward in terms of the guide for the third quarter and it kind of going forward, our assumption for Q3 is somewhat similar to Q2 in terms of continued recovery of a weak base. It was down 10% again last Q3 and then we started seeing recovery. And so I think about it \u2013 we're thinking about it in roughly the same kind of terms in Q3 that we saw in Q2. That's right. That's right. And I would say, Patrick to build on what Mike is saying, we still have \u2013 we're taking it as he said, kind of, one quarter at a time. We've built in some of that into Q3 and I would still say there is a bias to the upside in Q4. Just quickly, we're not going to give a specific target around that other than to say that our intent is to maintain an investment grade and we ended the quarter at, kind of 1 times net leverage and that gives us plenty of flexibility to continue to invest in deals growth accretive deals as Mike just talked about. I would say, Nathan as Mike said, still early days, but all the trends are looking positive."

And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mike. Mike?\nMike McMullen : Thanks, Ankur, and thank you to everyone for joining us today on our call. I'm very pleased to be on the call with you today. We are off to an excellent start to our fiscal year. The Agilent team delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. The momentum in our business continues. Revenues for the quarter are $1.55 billion. This is up 14% on a reported basis and 11% core, exceeding our mid-January revised expectations. Also, as expected, COVID-19 tailwinds added roughly 2.5 points to our overall growth. Operating margins are healthy, 25.5%. EPS of $1.06 is up 31% year-over-year. Overall, a very impressive start to 2021. Our growth is broad-based. All 3 of our business groups delivered double-digit growth. All regions grew, with the 2 largest leading the way. China grew 25%, and the Americas posted 13% growth. We continue to see strength in most of our end markets, led by pharma growing 20%. These results are a testament to our build and buy growth strategy and the Agilent team's relentless customer focus. Demand remains strong for the full breadth of our offerings. We have been gaining market share in key areas. We are clearly keeping our foot on the gas. Now, let's take a look at our performance by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $722 million in revenue, up 13% on a reported basis and up 11% core. LSAG's growth is broad-based across end markets and geographies. We are particularly pleased with our cell analysis business. Cell analysis grew in the high teens, led by BioTek, which grew 26%. Growth is also strong at liquid chromatography and mass spec product lines, with both growing in the teens. Overall, our LSAG business saw very strong demand as many customers utilized their end-of-year CapEx budgets and our market share gains continued. From an end market perspective, food and pharma led the way for LSAG. Continuing our biopharma investment focus, we introduced new updates to our MassHunter LC/MS software. This new software enables data integrity consisting important regulatory requirements for our biopharma customers. As we continue to build our digital lab, we introduced the Agilent 7850 ICP-MS System, which provides new smart digital tools to improve workflows. LSAG's broad and continually strengthening portfolio is well positioned and continues to outperform the industry.  The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $532 million. This is up a reported 13% and up 10% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based across end markets and geographies. Growth is strong in both services and consumables. Our digital investments and scale are adding significant value. We continue to drive improved attach rates to Agilent's large installed base of instruments. Annual service contract renewal rates and growth were strong in the quarter as we continue to build a more resilient and higher growth business. The Diagnostic and Genomics Group, revenues are $294 million, up 18% reported and up 15% core. Growth is broad-based, led by our NASD oligo business. Our genomics product portfolio grew double-digit, aided by COVID-19-related qPCR demand. We also achieved strong growth in our core NGS sample prep business. As mentioned earlier, overall company growth is broad-based across most of our end markets. The pharmaceutical food businesses led the way, both growing strong double-digits. We also posted 10% growth in the environmental and forensics market. Chemical and energy grew 2%, and we've seen increased business activity in the C&E space. The academia end market is down 1%, with many university labs still operating in a constrained environment. We are also continuing our efforts in the battle against COVID-19. We have completed our development and clinical validation for a serology assay to detect COVID-19 antibodies. We plan to submit to the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization within the next month. In addition, we're making progress on our qPCR-based test for COVID-19 detection and plan to launch in Europe in the next couple of months and submit for Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. within the same time frame. I'm also pleased to share that Barron's again recently named Agilent One of America's Most Sustainable Companies. This marks the third year in a row we have been included among the top 3 companies in this ranking. We've also been a leader in our industry all 4 years that Barron's list has been published. We're very proud of this honor. Sustainability is a key priority for our company. When I look back on the uncertainty we faced this time last year, I'm so proud of what the Agilent team accomplished, all-time high customer satisfaction ratings, building momentum in all our businesses and delivering excellent results. Our first quarter results are another compelling proof point that we\u2019re building an even stronger company and market position during the pandemic. As we discussed at our December investor event, our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy with a focus on high-growth markets continues to deliver. Our M&A funnel is robust and remains focused on growth-accretive M&A opportunities. We are targeting companies in markets where we see potential for significant long-term growth, and Agilent is in a strong position to win. As we look ahead, we have a sense of realistic optimism. We have solid momentum. We're winning in the market, and we have the right team to continue to succeed. As a result, we are raising our core growth guidance range to 6.5% to 8% for the year. As you may recall, we recently guided to a long-term core growth rate of between 5% and 7%, so we are certainly off to a good start in 2021, and we have no intention of slowing down. We have also raised our earnings guidance for the year. In December, I shared Agilent's long-range plan of margin expansion at 50 basis points to 100 basis points a year. We are now guiding towards the top end of that range for 2021. Bob will share more details on this in his remarks. I couldn't be more pleased with how we have started the year. We have momentum. Our team is strong and energized. We are gaining market share in key areas, and we have an even more promising outlook for the full year. Thanks for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?\nBob McMahon : Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on Q1 revenue and take you through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are very pleased with our first quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth exceeding our revised expectations. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.55 billion, reflecting reported growth of 14.1%. Core revenue growth was 11.3%, while currency contributed 2.8 points of growth. Now before I get into the end markets, Mike's earlier comments bear repeating. All 3 business groups delivered double-digit growth -- core growth in the quarter. Our superior value proposition continues to resonate with our customers and our team executed well, capitalizing on recovering demand in our end markets. Pharma, our largest market, was strong across all regions, delivering 20% growth. Growth was led by NASD, which experienced significant growth in the quarter, albeit against the easiest comp of the year. NASD contributed 4 points to the overall pharma growth rate. We continue to be very pleased about the ramp of the Frederick oligo facility, and the recently announced capacity expansion in Frederick is on track. Small molecule grew mid-teens, while biopharma, excluding NASD, delivered 20% growth driven in part by strong demand for LC and mass spec instrumentation. We saw strong year-end demand from pharma customers. We're also seeing increased business related to the characterization of oligo-based therapies and vaccines.  The food market also experienced strong double-digit growth during the quarter, posting a 22% increase in revenue. Our business grew in all geographies driven by increased demand for food safety and quality testing. China is leading the way, driven by investments in both commercial and government entities. Environmental and forensics grew double-digits, coming in at 10% core growth. Broad regional growth reflected strong tech refresh or replacement demand from contract labs. Our diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 9% during the quarter and has benefited from growth in COVID-related applications, primarily in the Americas and Europe. Our pathology business grew slightly as non-COVID testing continues to improve but has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels globally. While our diagnostics and clinical end market in China is still small, it experienced strong growth due to improvements in non-COVID testing and the uptake of our clinical LC/MS. The chemical and energy end market continued the recovery we saw last quarter and grew 2% in Q1. We continue to see signs of increased business activity, particularly in specialty chemicals and engineered materials along with encouraging improvements in the macro environment. And while we are optimistic, we are not yet reflecting a change in our forecast for the rest of the year. And as expected, the academia and government market recovery has lagged the other end markets, down 1% year-on-year as research labs are still not operating at full capacity. We continue to expect a slow but steady recovery throughout 2021. On a geographic basis, all regions grew. China grew 25%, leading all geographies, led by the food and pharma markets. The Americas delivered a strong double-digit performance during the quarter with 13% growth, while Europe was up 6%, both also led by pharma and food. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. The first quarter gross margin was 55.8%, up 10 basis points year-on-year. Adjusting for the exchange rates, gross margins improved 50 basis points. Our operating margin for the first quarter came in at 25.5%. This is up an impressive 260 basis points from last year, driven by volume and spending discipline. And this result includes the impact of increased strategic investments we started last quarter.  Our top-line growth, coupled with our operating leverage, helped deliver EPS of $1.06 per share, up 31% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75%, and our share count was [309 million] shares, as expected. Now onto the cash flow and the balance sheet. Our operating cash flow continues to be very strong. In Q1, we had operating cash flow of $238 million, a 43% increase over last year after adjusting for last year's 1 year -- one-time tax payment. This performance shows the strength of our business model and provides financial flexibility going forward. We continued the balanced capital deployment strategy we highlighted at our Annual Investor Event in December. In the quarter, we invested $41 million in capital expenditures, paid out $59 million in dividends and repurchased 2.9 million shares for $344 million. And as we announced earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program replacing the current program. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $1.3 billion in cash and $2.5 billion in debt. Now moving on to the outlook. We have had a strong start to the year. And while there are still uncertainties in front of us and the business environment remains fluid, we have solid momentum, and we see continued recovery in our end markets, albeit at different rates. And as a result, we're increasing our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. For revenue, we are increasing our full year to a range of $5.825 billion to $5.9 billion, up over $200 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 9% to 11% and core growth of 6.5% to 8%. This increase reflects strong Q1 results and some improvement in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The increased guide assumes stronger performance in most of our end markets. The academia market continues to track as expected in our initial plans. And while business activity in the chemical and energy has picked up, we have not yet included any improvement in that market in this updated outlook. In addition, we have not included any revenue associated with either the serology or qPCR COVID assay in the outlook. As Mike mentioned, we also feel very good about expanding our margins. During the Investor Event in December, we provided long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Given the volatility in results during 2020, our margin expansion profile will vary each quarter. However, we feel confident about our full year margin expansion being towards the top end of that range while also investing for future growth. The higher sales and margin expansion coupled with maintaining our tax rate at 14.75% and a lower share count of roughly 307 million shares, increases our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share. This is growth of 16% to 19% for the year. Now for the second fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion, representing reported growth of 11% to 12% and core growth of 7% to 9%. We expect second quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 per share, with growth of 10% to 13% as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the significant reduction in expenses in Q2 of last year. Now before opening the call for questions, I want to say I couldn't be more proud of the Agilent team in driving such strong performance. We have gotten off to a great start this year, and I'm personally very excited to know what this company is capable of moving forward. We have very strong momentum, the right approach that leads me believe that we're on a very solid path for Q2 and the rest of 2021. With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A.\nAnkur Dhingra : Thanks, Bob. Jason, if you can provide the instructions for Q&A, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.\nTycho Peterson : Congratulation here on the preannouncement. On that note, Mike, actually, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what drove the delta to the preannouncement. And then importantly, on sustainability, it sounds like you're not really calling out any kind of pull forward here. Curious as we think about it, and particularly that biopharma strength and the mid-teens growth you\u2019ve had in LC/MS, how are you thinking about the sustainability there?\nMike McMullen : Well, first of all, Tycho, thanks for the recognition. Really proud of the performance to even top our earlier revised expectations for the quarter. And I'd say that as we got into January, business in January was stronger than we had anticipated. And I think it was -- from a geographic perspective, we saw the strength in China. Obviously, that was higher than we had. We're thinking as long as very -- really good strength in the Americas, led by pharma and the food market. I'm sure we'll dial in today on the call about the food market, which is both growth in China as well as in Americas. And then no pull forwards. So it was a clean quarter with January being stronger than we had anticipated, when we already had announced an increase in our revenue outlook for the quarter. Bob, I don't know if I missed anything on the...\nBob McMahon : No. You got it.\nTycho Peterson : And on the LC/MS strength, up mid-teens, certainly better numbers than we're seeing from a lot of your peers. Can you just talk to that?\nMike McMullen : Yes, I think that it's a continuation of story that's been underway for several quarters. We've continued to innovate and provide value to the customers really see in our offerings, coupled with our approach to our field engagement and really maintaining our field force when our customer needs us most. We're getting the business. And it's very clear that not only is it a -- was there -- we saw, particularly in some of the pharma and non-COVID areas where they were basically making sure that they spent the capital had allocated for 2020, we got all that business, but it's more than that. It was a market share gain story as well for us. So I think it was a combination of a backtrack of investment by the pharma world but also our ability to gain share. And Bob, I know you've taken a close look at this and...\nBob McMahon : Yes, I think, Tycho, to Mike's point, I think one of the things we feel really good about is just our portfolio and our offerings to our customers. I think one things that we've seen is our responsiveness continues to improve, and that's been evidenced by the increased customer satisfaction that we've seen. And as Mike said, as the year-end CapEx spending happened, we were there, and I think we took more than our fair share. And we do think that this is an area that we continue to invest behind. Mike talked about the investment in the MassHunter software, which I think is going to really help continue this momentum that we have going forward from a compliance standpoint, and it's an area of focus, and we're very excited about the biopharma business going forward.\nMike McMullen : Yes. And there's a real holistic story here as well. You know the story already Tycho with our ACG business complementing, on the services and consumables complementing what we can do on leading innovative instrument solutions.\nTycho Peterson: And before I hop off, just one on ACG, you grew mid-20s in China off a low-teens comp. So it's not like the bar was low. Are you doing anything there structurally to kind of drive that acceleration?\nMike McMullen : What -- I'm going to let Padraig talk a little bit about that. Padraig, why don't you share your thoughts on that?\nPadraig McDonnell : Yes. Thanks, Mike. I think it's a combination of our scale on our service business in China and our connection with customers. And also, we've been investing in a number of years in our digital capabilities in China, which is really seeing a lot of pull-through from the customers and all markets are really driving the business forward, and we see it sustaining over the next period.\nBob McMahon : Yes, Tycho, just to build on what Padraig is saying, I mean, this is an area where we've also increased our investments in people on the street. And as we think about, Mike mentioned this in his script, actually our focus on actually turning ongoing revenue into service contracts, this is an area where we've had a specific focus in China there, and it's really helped us. And so we're -- that productivity aspect continues to play out in China.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.\nBrandon Couillard : Maybe, Mike, could you elaborate on your comment as far as beginning to see some improved activity in the C&E market? And maybe, Bob, could you give us some color on instruments versus aftermarket growth in the first quarter?\nMike McMullen : Yes, we're really talking about order activity, right? So we're seeing a lot of discussion with our field teams, particularly in the area what I would call high-value chemicals, specialty chemicals. So there's a lot more discussion going on with our field teams right now. And I think our customers are feeling more confident about the economic outlook and the end market demand that they can anticipate in the coming quarters. And as you know, this is against a backdrop of a lot of pent-up demand where investments have been deferred. And we're seeing -- continue to see strong PMIs. But as you heard me share the story forward, Brandon, I'm always reluctant to call a turn until we actually see a couple of quarters. So while we're optimistic about what we're seeing so far, we're not ready to yet to put it into the formal guide for the year.\nBob McMahon : Yes. And just on the second part of your question, Brandon, our instrumentation was roughly flat, and ACG was up mid-single-digits.\nBrandon Couillard : Then one follow-up for you, Bob. Gross margins in the first quarter were better. Do we expect that -- are you still thinking that the full year is still relatively flat to down? And any chance you could quantify the impact of the NASD capacity built on gross margin in the first quarter?\nBob McMahon : Yes. It was a little lower than what -- we would expect that to be higher in the back half of the year as we continue to ramp up. So it didn't really have a material impact on the first quarter. If you recall, we talked about that being roughly about 20 basis points for the full year, and that really didn't have an impact in the first quarter. And in terms of the overall year, I would say we're slightly more optimistic, kind of given where, certainly, the first quarter came in. And that's part of the increasing our top end, I would say, the margin expansion. It's a combination of a little more in gross margin, but most of it actually will be in the operating expenses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar : I guess for my first one, Mike, the guidance here, I guess Q2, your comps are pretty easy. You just did 11 in Q1. Could you perhaps comment on the Q2 and why that should step down? And when you look at the annual from an end market perspective, if C&E didn't change, I guess, is this biopharma that's changing for the annual outlook?\nBob McMahon : Yes, let me take a shot at it, and then I'll turn it over to Mike, Vijay. Thanks for the acknowledgment. Yes, I'll take the second question first and then go back to the first -- second quarter. If we think about where the full year is, it's mainly in that pharma and food markets across all of the regions that we see the uptake. And we are optimistic about chemical and energy, but we're not yet putting it into the forecast. It's still at the end of the quarter. As Mike said, we're seeing a lot of business activity. We're seeing the order funnel build and so forth, but we want to actually see those translate into orders and then ultimately into revenue. So everything there is moving in the right direction, and we would expect that to continue to play out throughout the course of the year. If I look at Q2, we did have a higher-than-expected budget -- year-end budget dynamic that helped, obviously, the 11%. That doesn't repeat itself in Q2. And -- but if you looked at -- we feel very confident about the continued momentum of the business going forward.\nMike McMullen : And that was probably a couple of points of growth maybe.\nBob McMahon : Yes. It's hard to estimate, but that's the best guess that we have, yes.\nVijay Kumar : Understood. And then I guess, just for my follow-up. Is the guide assuming, this COVID tailwinds that you mentioned 200 basis points in Q1, is that going to sustain? And I'm curious, what is driving the margin strength here, I guess, relative to your prior guide?\nMike McMullen : Yes. So I'll take the first one. Yes. So we're still in that 2 percentage kind of revenue range for COVID. So that's a good number to lock into.\nBob McMahon : Yes. And I think the growth on the margin expansion has been just really the strength in our volume. And I think that, that -- when we have that strong growth, you actually see it going to the bottom-line. When you look at last year, our spending profile changed pretty dramatically quarter-on-quarter as we were reflecting the pandemic and so forth. If we think about Q1 to Q2 this year, our spending, think about it as roughly flat sequentially.\nMike McMullen : Yes. And Vijay, I'm sure you had a chance to look at Jacob's margins for the first quarter, but LSAG had very strong margins. And that's -- when you have double-digit growth in LC, the strength in the cell analysis business, we had indicated when we acquired BioTek that we are buying not only high growth but also a high-margin company, I think you're seeing it in the numbers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from SVBL.\nPuneet Souda : So my first question is on China, which you alluded to a little bit before. Obviously, a strong quarter, but just walk us through where do we stand today in China food and where the products are resonating? What's your outlook here? Obviously, this has been a market that has been improving for you after some disruptions a while ago. And just want to get a sense of where it stands and how should we think about it going forward?\nMike McMullen : Yes, Puneet, thanks for your kind comments. And I'll make some initial introduction comments here about China food, and I'll invite Jacob into this conversation as his solutions are a big part of the story here. So this is a quick remind to the audience. You may recall that we saw a slowdown for the better part of over 2 years in the China food market as a result of the reorganization of the China food ministries, and we always have been pointing to the fact that there had been really deferred investment at the national level. And now that situation has completely changed, which are -- there's reinvestment going into new technologies at the national level. In addition too, the testing volumes continue to grow for the contract testing lab side, picking up that volume. And Jacob, I think we've got a pretty good position here in the marketplace with our mass spec portfolio.\nJacob Thaysen : Yes, certainly, Mike. So you're right that we are seeing a broad-based interest from our portfolio. But particularly, what stands out is our triple quad, both the LC/MS and the GC/MS, which is sought after, especially for pesticide testing where both technologies are used. And what we have developed here is one workflow, one sample press that can be used for both technologies. So that is very much better performance versus many others where you have to have 2 different kinds of setups. So we see a lot of interest in that. And so the triple quad is really paving the way right now.\nMike McMullen : And Jacob invested in a China solution center as well. So we actually, again, based on these leading technology platforms, are able to tailor our solutions for that China food market. So we're really excited about the change in the business volume there, as you can imagine.\nPuneet Souda : That's great. And if I could also ask in terms of pharma in China, could you maybe just elaborate your positioning there? You had really strong growth here in terms of both small molecules and biomolecules as well. Maybe just if you could characterize that, is that biomarker growth largely coming from NASD? Is that what's driving that part of the component? And the small molecules, you had really strong growth, too, so maybe if you could parse that out.\nMike McMullen : Yes. Specific to China, there's no NASD volume at all. It's zero in China. So that's purely on the -- on what we call the LSS side, which is ACG and LSAG business.\nBob McMahon : Yes. And I was going to say, Puneet, as we said in the call, our -- if you stripped out NASD, biopharma in total, so this would be our ACG and LSAG businesses together along with some contribution at DGG, grew 20%. And that was really broad-based across all regions. Actually, it was faster than that in China. But if you look across, they were all kind of neck and neck in terms of the performance across the regions.\nMike McMullen : Hey, Bob, I'd just add one thing. Although we don't have direct NASD business in China, as Bob highlighted in his script, we're seeing a lot of demand for LC/MS-based solution for oligo-based R&D research. And the fact that we're in this business ourselves with our own API business and that we have a state-of-the-art facility in our Frederick, Colorado site really helps us be able to sell solutions to our customers doing research in this area as well. So I do think there's a linkage of the oligo business into China, albeit on what we're seen on the research side.\nBob McMahon : Yes. And that small molecule in China was very strong.\nMike McMullen : Oh, yes, sorry about that. I missed that one. Yes. How can I miss that one?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Wells Fargo.\nDan Leonard : So first question, still trying to think of how to interpret your chemical and energy comments. The comps get pretty easy for that end market. And it doesn't sound like the 2% you reported in the quarter reflects what you're currently seeing on the order side. Are you still expecting kind of flattish chemical and energy performance through the balance of the year? Or could you help me with that?\nMike McMullen : I think the headline here is potential upside to our guide. And then, Bob, maybe you can answer the...\nBob McMahon : Yes. Mike mentioned the headline quite well. As we think about the chemical and energy, we've built in some slight improvement in Q1 and Q2, but have not made any changes to the back half.\nMike McMullen : And by the way, Dan, I'm not trying to be coy here or cute. We've just seen this market can easily can turn on the dime. And I've had experience where I've called it too soon. So once we feel confident about the book of business we have inside Agilent, we will be sure to give you an updated view of the outlook for the year.\nPadraig McDonnell : Mike, I think it's worth mentioning again that our competitive positioning is very strong here. And as you know, we have invested very heavily into our portfolio, both from an instrumentation, but also from an informatics point of view. So when the market comes back, we will certainly see a lion's share of that.\nMike McMullen : Yes. It should have been part 2 of my headline. When the business is there, we're going to get it.\nDan Leonard : Okay. And I appreciate that. And Mike, you've seen a lot of budget cycles. Could you maybe -- what we just saw in the quarter in context, you had a strong quarter, and I know share gain is part of that. All your peers had a really strong quarter. Are we going to look back at this period a couple of years from flush, particularly in pharma? Was this 1 for the history books? Or was this just a good flush? Like how would you characterize that?\nMike McMullen : I sure hope that's for the history books because it had a backdrop of a pandemic, and what we saw was some deferred capital investment that had been -- normally would have maybe been invested in the -- our Q2, Q3 because of COVID-19 concerns. And just the fact that customers weren't working, deferred the capital. But again, I would have to say there's more to the story in our Q1 than just that budget flush. So -- and -- but...\nBob McMahon : Yes, I was going to say, I would say it certainly was bigger than the last several years. I don't know -- and -- but I think as we think about the momentum that we've seen, when you look at where we were in Q4 as well, we started seeing the turnaround. And we saw it continue through Q1, and we're expecting that to continue into the rest of this year as well. So it's not just a one-quarter phenomenon. Certainly, it was stronger than we anticipated. But we have higher expectations going forward for growth in pharma.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen.\nDoug Schenkel : So my first question is on share gains. In your prepared remarks, and actually, I think in -- even in the press release, you highlighted market share several times in the context of the strong revenue growth you delivered in the fiscal first quarter. I'm curious if you could opine on where you think you're taking the most share and how sustainable this is? So that's the first topic. The second is on M&A. And the balance sheet is clean. You're re-upping on the share buybacks. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about M&A, and more specifically, the parameters that you are using to evaluate potential acquisitions moving forward?\nMike McMullen : Yes, Doug, thanks a lot for that. Happy to opine both questions. So yes, we really wanted to make sure the story came through that we had this a great start to 2021, and it wasn't just about a year-end budget flush. There's some really good things that have been going in for several quarters, and this continued in the first quarter. And we very specifically chose the language in key areas. So we're gaining share in some of our biggest product line areas. I would point to liquid chromatography. I\u2019d point to mass spectrometry, both gas phase, liquid phase and the inorganic side. I'd point to our services business. And -- what else might you add to that? I mean, I think it's pretty much broad-based.\nBob McMahon : Yes, and in our oligos business.\nMike McMullen : Yes, oligos because it always comes in 3, the oligos, I mean we had outstanding growth in Q1. So we're getting market share gains in the product lines where they really are collectively needle movers for the entire company. And then relative to the M&A, yes, we were in the market repurchasing shares this quarter, this past quarter, I should say, being anti-dilutive. But our priority remains, as we communicated, our December Investor and Analyst Day, which is we want to invest in the business, not only in terms of capital expansion building down NASD, for example, but also growth accretive M&A. And that remains our priority. You may have picked up in my comments, prepared comments that the discussions with potential targets, the deal activity is picking up. And I think -- and we've seen a number of other deals announced in our space. But I'd say the volume of discussion has much increased over the last quarter or 2. So nothing to announce, but that remains our area of focus for utilization of our strong balance sheet. And Bob, anything else you want to add?\nBob McMahon : Yes, the only thing I would say is, Doug, as we think about the markets that we compete in, our framework really hasn't changed. We're looking at markets that are faster-growing than the markets that we are in or sub-segments of those markets. We think the last couple of acquisitions have really borne that out with ACEA as well as BioTek in the cell analysis space, and it's really helped continue that shift to higher-growth markets, and that's the area that I would think -- and there's really opportunities across all of our -- both in instrumentation as well as in kind of consumables area or that recurring revenue stream as well. So that's the way I would think about it.\nMike McMullen : Yes. And Doug, we continue to look for companies also not only to meet that criteria, but also we think there are strong cultural fit that really would be part -- could really be a key part of the overall Agilent family, so to speak, and also a business where we think we can make that business even better.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Sykes : Nice solid quarter, guys. I just wanted to focus on, if you -- when you look at the DGG operating margin in the fourth quarter, it was obviously very strong. Just in terms of sustainability for that, what was driving that? And what should we expect as we go forward in '21?\nMike McMullen : Hey, Bob, do you and Sam want to tag team on this?\nBob McMahon : Yes, I'll start and then turn it over to Sam. I mean you see the strength really was volume-driven here -- and when we look at it. And as we ramp up that NASD facility, that's generated a very nice incremental growth on the bottom-line. As we mentioned in an earlier call, we haven't had the start-up costs really start showing up yet there. But I think that -- and then some of the qPCR activities and related have really helped drive this. Sam?\nSam Raha : Yes, Bob, great lead-in. I'll just add as you said, NASD, that business, we are in a place where we are getting -- using more and more our capacity. And that's a good thing as it relates to margin. On the genomics and pathology side as well, we have high-value products, such as our SureSelect NGS target enrichment platform, which had a good quarter, and we anticipate that continuing to grow. That's high margin. We have leadership in NGS quality control. And it's not just instruments there, there's ongoing consumables that go along with standards. So we expect our leadership position for that to grow. And we haven't talked about in a little while. But this past quarter, we also announced our seventh indication for PD-L1 to go along with KEYTRUDA for triple-negative breast cancer, and that's another place where we have leadership and drives good margin for us.\nMatt Sykes : Great. And just one quick follow-up. Just more of a high level. As you continue to grow your ACG franchise, could you just talk about how that impacts some of the divisions? And as you expand your reach, does that really help drive the LSG division and other types of segments that you have, just given that it just continues your reach within the market and deeper customer penetration?\nMike McMullen : Yes, Matt, you're on the right theme here. So in fact, when I talked about this most recently inside Agilent, I talked about this is where our LSAG and ACG businesses come together. And there really is a very symbiotic relationship here, which is both businesses help one another, right? So I pointed earlier to some of the strength we saw in the pharmaceutical industry in LC, LC/MS in Q1, but also was tied to the enterprise services story we've been talking about for a number of years. And when you start to get yourself into a different relationship with customers, they truly see you as that valued partner. And for example, when they've had several years of an enterprise service arrangement with you, and you show them collectively -- or I should say, actually, objectively, what's been going on the lab with various different vendors in terms of equipment, it will point to, for our case, a decision to let's move more of our business to Agilent instrument side.  Also, I think as Bob mentioned, we were there on a responsiveness standpoint. On our services, digital capabilities, we were able to respond to customers even in the midst of the pandemic, and they remember that, that we were there for them. And that translates into instrument business when they're doing their next round of capital purchase. So I think there really is a very close symbiotic relationship. And although we run them as we show the outside world, 2 separate business group results, they work very, very closely together, not only inside the company, but most importantly, with customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ryskin from Bank of America.\nMike Ryskin : This is Mike on for Derik. I want to follow-up on one thing you touched on it earlier. I mean, we've already hit on LC and just broader pharma markets a little bit. You had a comment of higher growth and pharma expected going forward. I just wanted to go a little deeper and try to get a sense for what are the key drivers here because there's so many moving pieces. You've got the end of your flush and maybe some catch-up in COVID early in the year. NASD obviously doing very well. Selling out is becoming a bigger part of the picture. You've got the share gains. So I'm just wondering, as you strip some of those out, are we seeing broader, higher levels of spend in pharma? Are we at to start of another LC replacement cycle? If you pay off some of those individual drivers, are we just seeing a better environment in pharma going forward for the next couple of years that would give you confidence that that's a little more sustainable? I got a follow-up to that. \nMike McMullen : Yes. So maybe just kind of parse out a couple of thoughts here, and then Bob we welcome your commentary here as well. So some of the things that you mentioned are clearly areas of higher growth today and expected to be higher growth for years to come. And that was part of our story back at the December Analyst Day, where we talked about, hey, we think RNA-based therapeutics are an area of very, very strong growth for years to come. And that's why you're seeing this growth in NASD happening right now as well as our continued investments to capture more of that future growth. Immuno-oncology is an area of major investment right now, and that's why we went after the cell analysis business several years ago. So we expect those segments of the market to be really strong double-digit growers for many years to come.  So I think that's part of the story there, which is to really have focused our investments and our portfolio towards those segments of the marketplace, which we expect to have even higher growth in the overall pharma market space. I think in general, we expect the biopharma R&D investments to continue the move to large molecule. When I get the question around LC replacements, the replacement cycle is always going on. And -- but what I do think is going to happen is, it's going to be stable, strong funding environment for pharma. So we're very optimistic about the long-term outlook for pharma. And I think it's a market I know we're betting on right now at Agilent.\nMike Ryskin : And then my follow-up on that is, by our math, if you take the magnitude of the 1Q beat and then also the stronger FX tailwind for the rest of the year, that accounts for roughly $175 million of the raised fiscal year guide. And maybe you have these other items coming in. You mentioned the COVID test. You've got the -- all your comments on the strength in the current market. So where exactly is the downside risk? I mean, especially given the comps over the next couple of quarters, what are the areas we should be keeping an eye on that would keep you from doing something closer to 10%-plus quarterly?\nBob McMahon : Yes, it's a great question. And I think one of the things, we still are in the midst of the pandemic, right? There's still the variance out there. We haven't seen any impact of that to date, but those are some things that we're watching. And we haven't built any of the COVID testing that you just talked about into the numbers. So that would definitely be something that when we get those approved, that would be upside to this. And that's not all within our control. The development and those timings are within our control. But ultimately, that's a bet that both on the serology side as well as the qPCR side that we feel confident about, and that would be on top of these. And then as we talked about before, the variability potentially in the C&E market is more biased towards the upside as we think about the forecast going forward. And so we feel good about where we are. We're early in the year and...\nMike McMullen : We\u2019re just one quarter in.\nBob McMahon : But we don't expect the momentum to abate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan from UBS.\nDaniel Brennan : I guess first question is maybe on China first, just I don't know if I missed it. Did you give what number or what growth rate you're assuming for the full year? And then within that, could you just discuss a bit more detail on the components of that, in particular, food, obviously, very strong this quarter. But how much more catch up potential is there in food, given how weak that business is then?\nBob McMahon : Yes. Let me take -- I'll take the first one, and then we can jump on and we can tag team, Mike, on the second one.\nMike McMullen : Yes, absolutely.\nBob McMahon : In China, we had forecasted roughly high single-digits at the beginning of the year. It certainly started much stronger than that. So we're expecting it be double-digits for the full year, really driven by both pharma and food. Those would be the two -- the upside drivers to our initial guide. And then I think on food, we've seen -- we saw stabilization really in the first half of 2020, saw an improvement in Q4. And that improvement continued here into Q1. And we would expect that to continue, given kind of the overall environment and sensitivity around food testing and so forth. But we're not quantifying how long or how much is left to catch up, so to speak.\nMike McMullen : Yes. I think also with food, I'm not sure I would really would use catch up describe this because, clearly, where you had some of the pharma companies just weren't having the research in and didn't work, had deferred investment, I think this has been part of the coming together of the new 5-year plan for China, and that's what's really driving this. So we would expect to see sustained investments, albeit not at this double-digit level. I think it's hard to know, Dan -- we've always felt this thing was not a market that was shrinking, wouldn't shrink long-term, which it had been for a few years, but it's more like a high single-digit longer term. And I think that's probably where we'd land, on your question, although I think we'll do double-digit for sure this year in '21.\nBob McMahon : Yes. We -- Mike, to your point, in our initial guide, we assume kind of a mid-single-digit as the recovery, and it's probably high single-digit to double-digit for the range for the full year.\nDaniel Brennan : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up on the NASD? What was the dollar contribution this quarter? What's kind of assumed in the full year? I don't know if you've changed that at all. And I know you've touched upon this, but in terms of other modalities besides interference, I guess, is that still -- it sounds like it's something that could possibly come, but we're still going to wait to hear from you guys on that. \nBob McMahon : Yes. What I would say, Dan, is we're at our full run rate capacity, which is, as we've talked in the past, $200 million a year. We hit that kind of where we expected to in Q1.\nMike McMullen : We're really happy with how that business is ramping.\nBob McMahon : And we're not done yet.\nJacob Thaysen : Hey, Bob, I would just add to that, that as I mentioned before, RNAi interference is our primary focus, but we are doing programs on Guide RNA for CRISPR, and we are at full tilt with that. But we are always looking to be in tune with new modalities. And if they're relevant, if they're sufficiently meaningful, we're definitely apprised of that as well. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. \nPatrick Donnelly : Mike, maybe one for you. Just on the chemical and energy side, certainly appreciate the conservatism baked in here. Can you just talk a little bit -- I know in the past, you've talked about kind of the shift from insourcing to outsourcing from customers and how that should play nicely into your strengths. Can you just talk about, I guess, where we are in that process and how big of an opportunity that is for you guys? .\nMike McMullen : Yes, I think we're still early days on that. I think it's -- that's part of the discussion. I think the investments that are going to happen this year, if they drop, are going to be more tied to deferred tech refresh. But I think it's probably more of a 2023 kind of -- excuse me, '22 event from the onshore and insourcing that we've been talking about. And I think this probably points to us being able to be able to sustain a mid-single-digit kind of end market. So it's -- I mean, it points to the fact that chemical and energy with these kind of longer-term outlooks coming from our customers will not be a drag on the overall growth rate, any material extended off. So I think it's an adder to the thesis that there is growth in the C&E market as well, albeit it can be a little bit -- it can move a little bit, depending on what's happening in the overall economy.\nPatrick Donnelly : Okay. Now it's going to be the year of durability at least. And then maybe just one...\nMike McMullen : I like what you said, I should have used durability. How was the short to answer your question. \nPatrick Donnelly : All good. I appreciate that. And then maybe just one on the academic side. Obviously, that's been lingering a little bit on the soft side, not only for you guys, but for much of the industry. I guess, where do you think we are there in terms of whatever metrics you guys look at, whether it's customers in the labs or whatever it may be? Maybe just kind of dive in that a little bit.\nMike McMullen : Yes. Great question. So when we\u2019re talking to our team and our customers, here's our view of it right now. We think about -- if you think about 30% of the research labs are fully operational now, we think about 60% are working at reduced capacity. We think about 10% are closed. And we really think it's going to be -- all this is really tied to ability to get the infection rates down, to get the vaccinations out. I think until that changes significantly, we're expecting kind of more of the same, I'd say, Bob, for the -- until we actually see a change in the overall\u2026\nBob McMahon : Yes, I think the real catalyst for us, Patrick, to Mike's point, is what's going to happen in the fall semester for classes?\nMike McMullen : Yes.\nBob McMahon : Are people -- are students going to be back full? Or is it still going to be at kind of reduced rates and so forth.\nMike McMullen : Yes.\nBob McMahon : So we're expecting continued recovery, albeit slow, really, and that's what we're looking at in addition to some of the kind of the macro levels.\nMike McMullen : I would say, though, that the conversation with customers is very robust right now. So it's just a matter of things opening up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research.\nSteve Willoughby : I had a follow-up question to Mike Ryskin's question as it relates to guidance, Bob. Maybe trying to ask it a different way. Have you really changed your organic or core growth assumptions over the remainder of the year? Because even in the first quarter here, you back out a couple of hundred basis points from sort of end-of-year budget spending. The first quarter still did basically twice what you were initially expecting for growth in the first quarter. And just looking to your guidance and doing some math, it looks like you really haven't made too much of a change for the organic growth over the remainder of the year. Is that fair to assume?\nBob McMahon : Yes. I would say we took Q1. We also upgraded Q2 and made some modest changes to the back half of the year, but most of that would be in the areas -- once we get further into the year, that would be an opportunity to revisit the forecast going forward. So I think bottom-line, you're in the ballpark.\nSteve Willoughby : Okay. And then just a follow-up question on diagnostics. So I guess 2 things to it. One, do you think we return to 2019 or normal levels in your non-COVID Diagnostics business this year? And then also, could you just provide a reminder on where you see your PCR test potentially fitting once it does come to market?\nMike McMullen : You want to take the first one and Sam the second one?\nBob McMahon : Yes. The short answer is yes, we expect it to get back, but again, latter half of this year. We're starting to see improvement. If you look at it by region, China is back. Certain pockets in Europe are back and certain places in the U.S. are back as well. But I think overall, it's probably going to be a few more months at least before it gets back to pre-COVID levels.\nSam Raha : Yes. With regards to your second question on qPCR, for COVID-19, our master mixes, our instruments are already being leveraged as part of other testing systems by customers around the world. When our own test comes to market, we see the opportunity. There's still a dearth of robust testing solutions that are available. So we'll have the right performance going after the right fragments or looking at the right elements of COVID-19. And it's really about our broad ability to distribute, make it available and also something that could be automatable on multiple platforms. So we think we'll have a play.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from the line of Paul Knight from KeyBanc.\nPaul Knight : So obviously, you've got a full array of products in the analytical instrument marketplace. And it goes back to, I think, Doug's question in terms of M&A, an opportunity. Where do you think you are in the full solution in cell analysis? Is there a lot to build? Is there a lot to buy in that particular market?\nMike McMullen : We think so. In fact, thanks for the question, Paul. You may recall -- and Jacob, feel free to jump in on this question as well. We teed up a fairly large -- although we're fully really proud of the business we've built so far, we think we have scale at a $300 million-plus business. We're playing in a much larger SAM. And we think there's both opportunities to further build out but also buy here as well. Jacob, your thoughts there?\nJacob Thaysen : Yes, certainly. We've been very intentional about how we build out our portfolio. Firstly, it\u2019s with instrument platforms that we ensure we can get some footprint and a scale in the market. And the next thing that would be the -- logic next step is to look at content, how do we actually get content on our instrument portfolio. So that's clearly an area we're looking into. But I actually think with the footprint, there's also opportunity to add other technique modalities into that. So we are -- we have open eyes. We follow what we call the tale of strains -- strain for all. And -- but -- and we wait to put another firm on that strain. And so we are -- keep our eyes open and then see what happens.\nPaul Knight : And then the last question would be you had mentioned your cost-cutting program that had started in the second quarter of last year, where you are -- where are you in that process? And what happens to cost-cutting when travel and entertainment might come back kind of post-COVID?\nBob McMahon : Yes. We're seeing some of that. And some of that is lapping this quarter because we saw a significant drop, and so you're not seeing the year-over-year changes. We're not seeing it go back. And our goal is to not have it go back. So we think we're at a new watermark here in terms of spending, particularly in travel and some of these other areas. Now we are increasing investments in places like digital and some of these other places that are driving demand as well as some of the capacity that we talked about before. But certainly, in those types of things, travel and so forth, we're not looking for that to go back. It will go back some, but certainly not back to the way we have been doing business before. Customers don't want it, and we are not going to let it happen.\nMike McMullen : Absolutely. To Bob's point, as I spoke the other day to our global field team, and we were talking about embracing our new ways of working. And of course, a lot of people drove and love to be back on the road. But not everybody feels that way. And the customers certainly don't feel that way because we're much more responsive and attentive to their needs by using digital platforms, there is a place for face-to-face, but it has to be based on the customer need, not because we want to be in the road to be out there doing things in a very traditional way. So we're keenly aware of the question you posed, Paul, really challenged ourselves to make sure that we really continue forward with these new ways of working. And this allows us to put money into areas that really do matter to customers. So I'd rather invest there rather than travel and entertainment.\nOperator: That concludes Q&A, and it also concludes today's Agilent Technologies First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you, everybody, for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes, Bob, great lead-in. I'll just add as you said, NASD, that business, we are in a place where we are getting -- using more and more our capacity. And that's a good thing as it relates to margin. On the genomics and pathology side as well, we have high-value products, such as our SureSelect NGS target enrichment platform, which had a good quarter, and we anticipate that continuing to grow. That's high margin. We have leadership in NGS quality control. And it's not just instruments there, there's ongoing consumables that go along with standards. So we expect our leadership position for that to grow. And we haven't talked about in a little while. But this past quarter, we also announced our seventh indication for PD-L1 to go along with KEYTRUDA for triple-negative breast cancer, and that's another place where we have leadership and drives good margin for us. Yes. With regards to your second question on qPCR, for COVID-19, our master mixes, our instruments are already being leveraged as part of other testing systems by customers around the world.

            "content": "Yes, certainly, Mike. So you're right that we are seeing a broad-based interest from our portfolio. But particularly, what stands out is our triple quad, both the LC/MS and the GC/MS, which is sought after, especially for pesticide testing where both technologies are used. And what we have developed here is one workflow, one sample press that can be used for both technologies. So that is very much better performance versus many others where you have to have 2 different kinds of setups. So we see a lot of interest in that. And so the triple quad is really paving the way right now. Hey, Bob, I would just add to that, that as I mentioned before, RNAi interference is our primary focus, but we are doing programs on Guide RNA for CRISPR, and we are at full tilt with that. But we are always looking to be in tune with new modalities. And if they're relevant, if they're sufficiently meaningful, we're definitely apprised of that as well. Yes, certainly. We've been very intentional about how we build out our portfolio. Firstly, it\u2019s with instrument platforms that we ensure we can get some footprint and a scale in the market.

And also, we've been investing in a number of years in our digital capabilities in China, which is really seeing a lot of pull-through from the customers and all markets are really driving the business forward, and we see it sustaining over the next period. Mike, I think it's worth mentioning again that our competitive positioning is very strong here. And as you know, we have invested very heavily into our portfolio, both from an instrumentation, but also from an informatics point of view. So when the market comes back, we will certainly see a lion's share of that."

            "content": "Thanks, Ankur, and thank you to everyone for joining us today on our call. I'm very pleased to be on the call with you today. We are off to an excellent start to our fiscal year. The Agilent team delivered outstanding results in the first quarter. The momentum in our business continues. Revenues for the quarter are $1.55 billion. This is up 14% on a reported basis and 11% core, exceeding our mid-January revised expectations. Also, as expected, COVID-19 tailwinds added roughly 2.5 points to our overall growth. Operating margins are healthy, 25.5%. EPS of $1.06 is up 31% year-over-year. Overall, a very impressive start to 2021. Our growth is broad-based. All 3 of our business groups delivered double-digit growth. All regions grew, with the 2 largest leading the way. China grew 25%, and the Americas posted 13% growth. We continue to see strength in most of our end markets, led by pharma growing 20%. These results are a testament to our build and buy growth strategy and the Agilent team's relentless customer focus. Demand remains strong for the full breadth of our offerings. We have been gaining market share in key areas. We are clearly keeping our foot on the gas. Now, let's take a look at our performance by business group. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated $722 million in revenue, up 13% on a reported basis and up 11% core. LSAG's growth is broad-based across end markets and geographies. We are particularly pleased with our cell analysis business. Cell analysis grew in the high teens, led by BioTek, which grew 26%. Growth is also strong at liquid chromatography and mass spec product lines, with both growing in the teens. Overall, our LSAG business saw very strong demand as many customers utilized their end-of-year CapEx budgets and our market share gains continued. From an end market perspective, food and pharma led the way for LSAG. Continuing our biopharma investment focus, we introduced new updates to our MassHunter LC/MS software. This new software enables data integrity consisting important regulatory requirements for our biopharma customers. As we continue to build our digital lab, we introduced the Agilent 7850 ICP-MS System, which provides new smart digital tools to improve workflows. LSAG's broad and continually strengthening portfolio is well positioned and continues to outperform the industry.  The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $532 million. This is up a reported 13% and up 10% core. ACG's growth is also broad-based across end markets and geographies. Growth is strong in both services and consumables. Our digital investments and scale are adding significant value. We continue to drive improved attach rates to Agilent's large installed base of instruments. Annual service contract renewal rates and growth were strong in the quarter as we continue to build a more resilient and higher growth business. The Diagnostic and Genomics Group, revenues are $294 million, up 18% reported and up 15% core. Growth is broad-based, led by our NASD oligo business. Our genomics product portfolio grew double-digit, aided by COVID-19-related qPCR demand. We also achieved strong growth in our core NGS sample prep business. As mentioned earlier, overall company growth is broad-based across most of our end markets. The pharmaceutical food businesses led the way, both growing strong double-digits. We also posted 10% growth in the environmental and forensics market. Chemical and energy grew 2%, and we've seen increased business activity in the C&E space. The academia end market is down 1%, with many university labs still operating in a constrained environment. We are also continuing our efforts in the battle against COVID-19. We have completed our development and clinical validation for a serology assay to detect COVID-19 antibodies. We plan to submit to the U.S. FDA for Emergency Use Authorization within the next month. In addition, we're making progress on our qPCR-based test for COVID-19 detection and plan to launch in Europe in the next couple of months and submit for Emergency Use Authorization in the U.S. within the same time frame. I'm also pleased to share that Barron's again recently named Agilent One of America's Most Sustainable Companies. This marks the third year in a row we have been included among the top 3 companies in this ranking. We've also been a leader in our industry all 4 years that Barron's list has been published. We're very proud of this honor. Sustainability is a key priority for our company. When I look back on the uncertainty we faced this time last year, I'm so proud of what the Agilent team accomplished, all-time high customer satisfaction ratings, building momentum in all our businesses and delivering excellent results. Our first quarter results are another compelling proof point that we\u2019re building an even stronger company and market position during the pandemic. As we discussed at our December investor event, our diverse industry-leading product portfolio has never been stronger. Our building and buying growth strategy with a focus on high-growth markets continues to deliver. Our M&A funnel is robust and remains focused on growth-accretive M&A opportunities. We are targeting companies in markets where we see potential for significant long-term growth, and Agilent is in a strong position to win. As we look ahead, we have a sense of realistic optimism. We have solid momentum. We're winning in the market, and we have the right team to continue to succeed. As a result, we are raising our core growth guidance range to 6.5% to 8% for the year. As you may recall, we recently guided to a long-term core growth rate of between 5% and 7%, so we are certainly off to a good start in 2021, and we have no intention of slowing down. We have also raised our earnings guidance for the year. In December, I shared Agilent's long-range plan of margin expansion at 50 basis points to 100 basis points a year. We are now guiding towards the top end of that range for 2021. Bob will share more details on this in his remarks. I couldn't be more pleased with how we have started the year. We have momentum. Our team is strong and energized. We are gaining market share in key areas, and we have an even more promising outlook for the full year. Thanks for being on the call today, and I look forward to your questions. I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Well, first of all, Tycho, thanks for the recognition. Really proud of the performance to even top our earlier revised expectations for the quarter. And I'd say that as we got into January, business in January was stronger than we had anticipated. And I think it was -- from a geographic perspective, we saw the strength in China. Obviously, that was higher than we had. We're thinking as long as very -- really good strength in the Americas, led by pharma and the food market. I'm sure we'll dial in today on the call about the food market, which is both growth in China as well as in Americas. And then no pull forwards. So it was a clean quarter with January being stronger than we had anticipated, when we already had announced an increase in our revenue outlook for the quarter. Bob, I don't know if I missed anything on the... Yes, I think that it's a continuation of story that's been underway for several quarters. We've continued to innovate and provide value to the customers really see in our offerings, coupled with our approach to our field engagement and really maintaining our field force when our customer needs us most. We're getting the business. And it's very clear that not only is it a -- was there -- we saw, particularly in some of the pharma and non-COVID areas where they were basically making sure that they spent the capital had allocated for 2020, we got all that business, but it's more than that. It was a market share gain story as well for us. So I think it was a combination of a backtrack of investment by the pharma world but also our ability to gain share. And Bob, I know you've taken a close look at this and... Yes. And there's a real holistic story here as well. You know the story already Tycho with our ACG business complementing, on the services and consumables complementing what we can do on leading innovative instrument solutions. What -- I'm going to let Padraig talk a little bit about that. Padraig, why don't you share your thoughts on that? Yes, we're really talking about order activity, right? So we're seeing a lot of discussion with our field teams, particularly in the area what I would call high-value chemicals, specialty chemicals. So there's a lot more discussion going on with our field teams right now. And I think our customers are feeling more confident about the economic outlook and the end market demand that they can anticipate in the coming quarters. And as you know, this is against a backdrop of a lot of pent-up demand where investments have been deferred. And we're seeing -- continue to see strong PMIs. But as you heard me share the story forward, Brandon, I'm always reluctant to call a turn until we actually see a couple of quarters. So while we're optimistic about what we're seeing so far, we're not ready to yet to put it into the formal guide for the year. And that was probably a couple of points of growth maybe. Yes. So I'll take the first one. Yes. So we're still in that 2 percentage kind of revenue range for COVID. So that's a good number to lock into. Yes. And Vijay, I'm sure you had a chance to look at Jacob's margins for the first quarter, but LSAG had very strong margins. And that's -- when you have double-digit growth in LC, the strength in the cell analysis business, we had indicated when we acquired BioTek that we are buying not only high growth but also a high-margin company, I think you're seeing it in the numbers. Yes, Puneet, thanks for your kind comments. And I'll make some initial introduction comments here about China food, and I'll invite Jacob into this conversation as his solutions are a big part of the story here. So this is a quick remind to the audience. You may recall that we saw a slowdown for the better part of over 2 years in the China food market as a result of the reorganization of the China food ministries, and we always have been pointing to the fact that there had been really deferred investment at the national level. And now that situation has completely changed, which are -- there's reinvestment going into new technologies at the national level. In addition too, the testing volumes continue to grow for the contract testing lab side, picking up that volume. And Jacob, I think we've got a pretty good position here in the marketplace with our mass spec portfolio. And Jacob invested in a China solution center as well. So we actually, again, based on these leading technology platforms, are able to tailor our solutions for that China food market. So we're really excited about the change in the business volume there, as you can imagine. Yes. Specific to China, there's no NASD volume at all. It's zero in China. So that's purely on the -- on what we call the LSS side, which is ACG and LSAG business. Hey, Bob, I'd just add one thing. Although we don't have direct NASD business in China, as Bob highlighted in his script, we're seeing a lot of demand for LC/MS-based solution for oligo-based R&D research. And the fact that we're in this business ourselves with our own API business and that we have a state-of-the-art facility in our Frederick, Colorado site really helps us be able to sell solutions to our customers doing research in this area as well. So I do think there's a linkage of the oligo business into China, albeit on what we're seen on the research side. Oh, yes, sorry about that. I missed that one. Yes. How can I miss that one? I think the headline here is potential upside to our guide. And then, Bob, maybe you can answer the... And by the way, Dan, I'm not trying to be coy here or cute. We've just seen this market can easily can turn on the dime. And I've had experience where I've called it too soon. So once we feel confident about the book of business we have inside Agilent, we will be sure to give you an updated view of the outlook for the year. Yes. It should have been part 2 of my headline. When the business is there, we're going to get it. I sure hope that's for the history books because it had a backdrop of a pandemic, and what we saw was some deferred capital investment that had been -- normally would have maybe been invested in the -- our Q2, Q3 because of COVID-19 concerns. And just the fact that customers weren't working, deferred the capital. But again, I would have to say there's more to the story in our Q1 than just that budget flush. So -- and -- but... Yes, Doug, thanks a lot for that. Happy to opine both questions. So yes, we really wanted to make sure the story came through that we had this a great start to 2021, and it wasn't just about a year-end budget flush. There's some really good things that have been going in for several quarters, and this continued in the first quarter. And we very specifically chose the language in key areas. So we're gaining share in some of our biggest product line areas. I would point to liquid chromatography. I\u2019d point to mass spectrometry, both gas phase, liquid phase and the inorganic side. I'd point to our services business. And -- what else might you add to that? I mean, I think it's pretty much broad-based. Yes, oligos because it always comes in 3, the oligos, I mean we had outstanding growth in Q1. So we're getting market share gains in the product lines where they really are collectively needle movers for the entire company. And then relative to the M&A, yes, we were in the market repurchasing shares this quarter, this past quarter, I should say, being anti-dilutive. But our priority remains, as we communicated, our December Investor and Analyst Day, which is we want to invest in the business, not only in terms of capital expansion building down NASD, for example, but also growth accretive M&A. And that remains our priority. You may have picked up in my comments, prepared comments that the discussions with potential targets, the deal activity is picking up. And I think -- and we've seen a number of other deals announced in our space. But I'd say the volume of discussion has much increased over the last quarter or 2. So nothing to announce, but that remains our area of focus for utilization of our strong balance sheet. And Bob, anything else you want to add? Yes. And Doug, we continue to look for companies also not only to meet that criteria, but also we think there are strong cultural fit that really would be part -- could really be a key part of the overall Agilent family, so to speak, and also a business where we think we can make that business even better. Hey, Bob, do you and Sam want to tag team on this? Yes, Matt, you're on the right theme here. So in fact, when I talked about this most recently inside Agilent, I talked about this is where our LSAG and ACG businesses come together. And there really is a very symbiotic relationship here, which is both businesses help one another, right? So I pointed earlier to some of the strength we saw in the pharmaceutical industry in LC, LC/MS in Q1, but also was tied to the enterprise services story we've been talking about for a number of years. And when you start to get yourself into a different relationship with customers, they truly see you as that valued partner. And for example, when they've had several years of an enterprise service arrangement with you, and you show them collectively -- or I should say, actually, objectively, what's been going on the lab with various different vendors in terms of equipment, it will point to, for our case, a decision to let's move more of our business to Agilent instrument side.  Also, I think as Bob mentioned, we were there on a responsiveness standpoint. On our services, digital capabilities, we were able to respond to customers even in the midst of the pandemic, and they remember that, that we were there for them. And that translates into instrument business when they're doing their next round of capital purchase. So I think there really is a very close symbiotic relationship. And although we run them as we show the outside world, 2 separate business group results, they work very, very closely together, not only inside the company, but most importantly, with customers. Yes. So maybe just kind of parse out a couple of thoughts here, and then Bob we welcome your commentary here as well. So some of the things that you mentioned are clearly areas of higher growth today and expected to be higher growth for years to come. And that was part of our story back at the December Analyst Day, where we talked about, hey, we think RNA-based therapeutics are an area of very, very strong growth for years to come. And that's why you're seeing this growth in NASD happening right now as well as our continued investments to capture more of that future growth. Immuno-oncology is an area of major investment right now, and that's why we went after the cell analysis business several years ago. So we expect those segments of the market to be really strong double-digit growers for many years to come.  So I think that's part of the story there, which is to really have focused our investments and our portfolio towards those segments of the marketplace, which we expect to have even higher growth in the overall pharma market space. I think in general, we expect the biopharma R&D investments to continue the move to large molecule. When I get the question around LC replacements, the replacement cycle is always going on. And -- but what I do think is going to happen is, it's going to be stable, strong funding environment for pharma. So we're very optimistic about the long-term outlook for pharma. And I think it's a market I know we're betting on right now at Agilent. We\u2019re just one quarter in. Yes, absolutely. Yes. I think also with food, I'm not sure I would really would use catch up describe this because, clearly, where you had some of the pharma companies just weren't having the research in and didn't work, had deferred investment, I think this has been part of the coming together of the new 5-year plan for China, and that's what's really driving this. So we would expect to see sustained investments, albeit not at this double-digit level. I think it's hard to know, Dan -- we've always felt this thing was not a market that was shrinking, wouldn't shrink long-term, which it had been for a few years, but it's more like a high single-digit longer term. And I think that's probably where we'd land, on your question, although I think we'll do double-digit for sure this year in '21. We're really happy with how that business is ramping. Yes, I think we're still early days on that. I think it's -- that's part of the discussion. I think the investments that are going to happen this year, if they drop, are going to be more tied to deferred tech refresh. But I think it's probably more of a 2023 kind of -- excuse me, '22 event from the onshore and insourcing that we've been talking about. And I think this probably points to us being able to be able to sustain a mid-single-digit kind of end market. So it's -- I mean, it points to the fact that chemical and energy with these kind of longer-term outlooks coming from our customers will not be a drag on the overall growth rate, any material extended off. So I think it's an adder to the thesis that there is growth in the C&E market as well, albeit it can be a little bit -- it can move a little bit, depending on what's happening in the overall economy. I like what you said, I should have used durability. How was the short to answer your question. Yes. Great question. So when we\u2019re talking to our team and our customers, here's our view of it right now. We think about -- if you think about 30% of the research labs are fully operational now, we think about 60% are working at reduced capacity. We think about 10% are closed. And we really think it's going to be -- all this is really tied to ability to get the infection rates down, to get the vaccinations out. I think until that changes significantly, we're expecting kind of more of the same, I'd say, Bob, for the -- until we actually see a change in the overall\u2026 Yes. Yes. I would say, though, that the conversation with customers is very robust right now. So it's just a matter of things opening up. You want to take the first one and Sam the second one? We think so. In fact, thanks for the question, Paul. You may recall -- and Jacob, feel free to jump in on this question as well. We teed up a fairly large -- although we're fully really proud of the business we've built so far, we think we have scale at a $300 million-plus business. We're playing in a much larger SAM. And we think there's both opportunities to further build out but also buy here as well. Jacob, your thoughts there? Absolutely. To Bob's point, as I spoke the other day to our global field team, and we were talking about embracing our new ways of working. And of course, a lot of people drove and love to be back on the road. But not everybody feels that way. And the customers certainly don't feel that way because we're much more responsive and attentive to their needs by using digital platforms, there is a place for face-to-face, but it has to be based on the customer need, not because we want to be in the road to be out there doing things in a very traditional way. So we're keenly aware of the question you posed, Paul, really challenged ourselves to make sure that we really continue forward with these new ways of working.

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on Q1 revenue and take you through the first quarter income statement and some other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our outlook for 2021 and the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are very pleased with our first quarter results as we saw strong broad-based growth exceeding our revised expectations. Revenue for the first quarter was $1.55 billion, reflecting reported growth of 14.1%. Core revenue growth was 11.3%, while currency contributed 2.8 points of growth. Now before I get into the end markets, Mike's earlier comments bear repeating. All 3 business groups delivered double-digit growth -- core growth in the quarter. Our superior value proposition continues to resonate with our customers and our team executed well, capitalizing on recovering demand in our end markets. Pharma, our largest market, was strong across all regions, delivering 20% growth. Growth was led by NASD, which experienced significant growth in the quarter, albeit against the easiest comp of the year. NASD contributed 4 points to the overall pharma growth rate. We continue to be very pleased about the ramp of the Frederick oligo facility, and the recently announced capacity expansion in Frederick is on track. Small molecule grew mid-teens, while biopharma, excluding NASD, delivered 20% growth driven in part by strong demand for LC and mass spec instrumentation. We saw strong year-end demand from pharma customers. We're also seeing increased business related to the characterization of oligo-based therapies and vaccines.  The food market also experienced strong double-digit growth during the quarter, posting a 22% increase in revenue. Our business grew in all geographies driven by increased demand for food safety and quality testing. China is leading the way, driven by investments in both commercial and government entities. Environmental and forensics grew double-digits, coming in at 10% core growth. Broad regional growth reflected strong tech refresh or replacement demand from contract labs. Our diagnostics and clinical revenue grew 9% during the quarter and has benefited from growth in COVID-related applications, primarily in the Americas and Europe. Our pathology business grew slightly as non-COVID testing continues to improve but has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels globally. While our diagnostics and clinical end market in China is still small, it experienced strong growth due to improvements in non-COVID testing and the uptake of our clinical LC/MS. The chemical and energy end market continued the recovery we saw last quarter and grew 2% in Q1. We continue to see signs of increased business activity, particularly in specialty chemicals and engineered materials along with encouraging improvements in the macro environment. And while we are optimistic, we are not yet reflecting a change in our forecast for the rest of the year. And as expected, the academia and government market recovery has lagged the other end markets, down 1% year-on-year as research labs are still not operating at full capacity. We continue to expect a slow but steady recovery throughout 2021. On a geographic basis, all regions grew. China grew 25%, leading all geographies, led by the food and pharma markets. The Americas delivered a strong double-digit performance during the quarter with 13% growth, while Europe was up 6%, both also led by pharma and food. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. The first quarter gross margin was 55.8%, up 10 basis points year-on-year. Adjusting for the exchange rates, gross margins improved 50 basis points. Our operating margin for the first quarter came in at 25.5%. This is up an impressive 260 basis points from last year, driven by volume and spending discipline. And this result includes the impact of increased strategic investments we started last quarter.  Our top-line growth, coupled with our operating leverage, helped deliver EPS of $1.06 per share, up 31% versus last year. Our tax rate was 14.75%, and our share count was [309 million] shares, as expected. Now onto the cash flow and the balance sheet. Our operating cash flow continues to be very strong. In Q1, we had operating cash flow of $238 million, a 43% increase over last year after adjusting for last year's 1 year -- one-time tax payment. This performance shows the strength of our business model and provides financial flexibility going forward. We continued the balanced capital deployment strategy we highlighted at our Annual Investor Event in December. In the quarter, we invested $41 million in capital expenditures, paid out $59 million in dividends and repurchased 2.9 million shares for $344 million. And as we announced earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program replacing the current program. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $1.3 billion in cash and $2.5 billion in debt. Now moving on to the outlook. We have had a strong start to the year. And while there are still uncertainties in front of us and the business environment remains fluid, we have solid momentum, and we see continued recovery in our end markets, albeit at different rates. And as a result, we're increasing our full year projections for both revenue and earnings per share. For revenue, we are increasing our full year to a range of $5.825 billion to $5.9 billion, up over $200 million at the midpoint and representing reported growth of 9% to 11% and core growth of 6.5% to 8%. This increase reflects strong Q1 results and some improvement in our outlook for the remainder of the year. The increased guide assumes stronger performance in most of our end markets. The academia market continues to track as expected in our initial plans. And while business activity in the chemical and energy has picked up, we have not yet included any improvement in that market in this updated outlook. In addition, we have not included any revenue associated with either the serology or qPCR COVID assay in the outlook. As Mike mentioned, we also feel very good about expanding our margins. During the Investor Event in December, we provided long-range plan of annual margin expansion in the range of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Given the volatility in results during 2020, our margin expansion profile will vary each quarter. However, we feel confident about our full year margin expansion being towards the top end of that range while also investing for future growth. The higher sales and margin expansion coupled with maintaining our tax rate at 14.75% and a lower share count of roughly 307 million shares, increases our fiscal 2021 non-GAAP EPS to a range of $3.80 to $3.90 per share. This is growth of 16% to 19% for the year. Now for the second fiscal quarter, we're expecting revenue to range from $1.37 billion to $1.39 billion, representing reported growth of 11% to 12% and core growth of 7% to 9%. We expect second quarter 2021 non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.80 per share, with growth of 10% to 13% as we approach the 1-year anniversary of the significant reduction in expenses in Q2 of last year. Now before opening the call for questions, I want to say I couldn't be more proud of the Agilent team in driving such strong performance. We have gotten off to a great start this year, and I'm personally very excited to know what this company is capable of moving forward. We have very strong momentum, the right approach that leads me believe that we're on a very solid path for Q2 and the rest of 2021. With that, Ankur, back to you for the Q&A. No. You got it. Yes, I think, Tycho, to Mike's point, I think one of the things we feel really good about is just our portfolio and our offerings to our customers. I think one things that we've seen is our responsiveness continues to improve, and that's been evidenced by the increased customer satisfaction that we've seen. And as Mike said, as the year-end CapEx spending happened, we were there, and I think we took more than our fair share. And we do think that this is an area that we continue to invest behind. Mike talked about the investment in the MassHunter software, which I think is going to really help continue this momentum that we have going forward from a compliance standpoint, and it's an area of focus, and we're very excited about the biopharma business going forward. Yes, Tycho, just to build on what Padraig is saying, I mean, this is an area where we've also increased our investments in people on the street. And as we think about, Mike mentioned this in his script, actually our focus on actually turning ongoing revenue into service contracts, this is an area where we've had a specific focus in China there, and it's really helped us. And so we're -- that productivity aspect continues to play out in China. Yes. And just on the second part of your question, Brandon, our instrumentation was roughly flat, and ACG was up mid-single-digits. Yes. It was a little lower than what -- we would expect that to be higher in the back half of the year as we continue to ramp up. So it didn't really have a material impact on the first quarter. If you recall, we talked about that being roughly about 20 basis points for the full year, and that really didn't have an impact in the first quarter. And in terms of the overall year, I would say we're slightly more optimistic, kind of given where, certainly, the first quarter came in. And that's part of the increasing our top end, I would say, the margin expansion. It's a combination of a little more in gross margin, but most of it actually will be in the operating expenses. Yes, let me take a shot at it, and then I'll turn it over to Mike, Vijay. Thanks for the acknowledgment. Yes, I'll take the second question first and then go back to the first -- second quarter. If we think about where the full year is, it's mainly in that pharma and food markets across all of the regions that we see the uptake. And we are optimistic about chemical and energy, but we're not yet putting it into the forecast. It's still at the end of the quarter. As Mike said, we're seeing a lot of business activity. We're seeing the order funnel build and so forth, but we want to actually see those translate into orders and then ultimately into revenue. So everything there is moving in the right direction, and we would expect that to continue to play out throughout the course of the year. If I look at Q2, we did have a higher-than-expected budget -- year-end budget dynamic that helped, obviously, the 11%. That doesn't repeat itself in Q2. And -- but if you looked at -- we feel very confident about the continued momentum of the business going forward. Yes. It's hard to estimate, but that's the best guess that we have, yes. Yes. And I think the growth on the margin expansion has been just really the strength in our volume. And I think that, that -- when we have that strong growth, you actually see it going to the bottom-line. When you look at last year, our spending profile changed pretty dramatically quarter-on-quarter as we were reflecting the pandemic and so forth. If we think about Q1 to Q2 this year, our spending, think about it as roughly flat sequentially. Yes. And I was going to say, Puneet, as we said in the call, our -- if you stripped out NASD, biopharma in total, so this would be our ACG and LSAG businesses together along with some contribution at DGG, grew 20%. And that was really broad-based across all regions. Actually, it was faster than that in China. But if you look across, they were all kind of neck and neck in terms of the performance across the regions. Yes. And that small molecule in China was very strong. Yes. Mike mentioned the headline quite well. As we think about the chemical and energy, we've built in some slight improvement in Q1 and Q2, but have not made any changes to the back half. Yes, I was going to say, I would say it certainly was bigger than the last several years. I don't know -- and -- but I think as we think about the momentum that we've seen, when you look at where we were in Q4 as well, we started seeing the turnaround. And we saw it continue through Q1, and we're expecting that to continue into the rest of this year as well. So it's not just a one-quarter phenomenon. Certainly, it was stronger than we anticipated. But we have higher expectations going forward for growth in pharma. Yes, and in our oligos business. Yes, the only thing I would say is, Doug, as we think about the markets that we compete in, our framework really hasn't changed. We're looking at markets that are faster-growing than the markets that we are in or sub-segments of those markets. We think the last couple of acquisitions have really borne that out with ACEA as well as BioTek in the cell analysis space, and it's really helped continue that shift to higher-growth markets, and that's the area that I would think -- and there's really opportunities across all of our -- both in instrumentation as well as in kind of consumables area or that recurring revenue stream as well. So that's the way I would think about it. Yes, I'll start and then turn it over to Sam. I mean you see the strength really was volume-driven here -- and when we look at it. And as we ramp up that NASD facility, that's generated a very nice incremental growth on the bottom-line. As we mentioned in an earlier call, we haven't had the start-up costs really start showing up yet there. But I think that -- and then some of the qPCR activities and related have really helped drive this. Sam? Yes, it's a great question. And I think one of the things, we still are in the midst of the pandemic, right? There's still the variance out there. We haven't seen any impact of that to date, but those are some things that we're watching. And we haven't built any of the COVID testing that you just talked about into the numbers. So that would definitely be something that when we get those approved, that would be upside to this. And that's not all within our control. The development and those timings are within our control. But ultimately, that's a bet that both on the serology side as well as the qPCR side that we feel confident about, and that would be on top of these. And then as we talked about before, the variability potentially in the C&E market is more biased towards the upside as we think about the forecast going forward. And so we feel good about where we are. We're early in the year and... But we don't expect the momentum to abate. Yes. Let me take -- I'll take the first one, and then we can jump on and we can tag team, Mike, on the second one. In China, we had forecasted roughly high single-digits at the beginning of the year. It certainly started much stronger than that. So we're expecting it be double-digits for the full year, really driven by both pharma and food. Those would be the two -- the upside drivers to our initial guide. And then I think on food, we've seen -- we saw stabilization really in the first half of 2020, saw an improvement in Q4. And that improvement continued here into Q1. And we would expect that to continue, given kind of the overall environment and sensitivity around food testing and so forth. But we're not quantifying how long or how much is left to catch up, so to speak. Yes. We -- Mike, to your point, in our initial guide, we assume kind of a mid-single-digit as the recovery, and it's probably high single-digit to double-digit for the range for the full year. Yes. What I would say, Dan, is we're at our full run rate capacity, which is, as we've talked in the past, $200 million a year. We hit that kind of where we expected to in Q1. And we're not done yet. Yes, I think the real catalyst for us, Patrick, to Mike's point, is what's going to happen in the fall semester for classes? Are people -- are students going to be back full? Or is it still going to be at kind of reduced rates and so forth. So we're expecting continued recovery, albeit slow, really, and that's what we're looking at in addition to some of the kind of the macro levels. Yes. I would say we took Q1. We also upgraded Q2 and made some modest changes to the back half of the year, but most of that would be in the areas -- once we get further into the year, that would be an opportunity to revisit the forecast going forward. So I think bottom-line, you're in the ballpark. Yes. The short answer is yes, we expect it to get back, but again, latter half of this year. We're starting to see improvement. If you look at it by region, China is back. Certain pockets in Europe are back and certain places in the U.S. are back as well. But I think overall, it's probably going to be a few more months at least before it gets back to pre-COVID levels. Yes. We're seeing some of that. And some of that is lapping this quarter because we saw a significant drop, and so you're not seeing the year-over-year changes. We're not seeing it go back. And our goal is to not have it go back. So we think we're at a new watermark here in terms of spending, particularly in travel and some of these other areas. Now we are increasing investments in places like digital and some of these other places that are driving demand as well as some of the capacity that we talked about before. But certainly, in those types of things, travel and so forth, we're not looking for that to go back. It will go back some, but certainly not back to the way we have been doing business before. Customers don't want it, and we are not going to let it happen."

And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. In the fourth quarter, the Agilent team continued its strong performance. We delivered an excellent quarter, significantly exceeding our revenue and earnings expectations.  Revenue of $1.85 billion is up more than 17% core. Our strong top line performance helped deliver fourth quarter operating margins of 29.1%. The operating margins continue to expand despite the inflationary environment and the strengthening dollar and are up 260 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.53 were up 26%. These Q4 results mark an outstanding finish to another strong year for Agilent\u2019s fiscal 2022. The full year revenue of $6.85 billion, we delivered core revenue growth of 12%. This is on top of core revenue growth of 15% in 2021. Our operating margin continued to increase and a 27.1% for the year, up 160 basis points. Earnings per share of $5.22 per share, up 20% for the year. Rx result this year highlight the ongoing strength of our diversified business and shine a light on the multiple growth drivers we put in place over the years. They also continue to demonstrate the outstanding execution capabilities of the Agilent team. Throughout the year, we navigated market uncertainties, inflation, COVID-related shutdowns and supply chain and logistics constraints. Our strength is broad-based with all three business groups growing double digits for the year. All major geographies and regions grew double digits in FY '22 after adjusting from our exit from Russia. This was highlighted by China leading the way, growing 18%. From an end market perspective, all markets expanded led by excellent growth in our two largest markets, Pharma and Chemical & Advanced Materials. All in all, it was an extremely good year for Agilent.  Let's now take a closer look at our fourth quarter performance, starting with end market highlights. During Q4, our performance led by 20%-plus growth in three of our six end markets. Pharma, our largest market, posted 20% growth on top of 21% in Q4 last year. The Chemicals & Advanced Materials business grew 27%. We saw robust demand in chemicals, along with secular growth in semiconductors, batteries and other advanced materials. The food market also grew 20% on a strong end-of-year demand in China that have been previously delayed by COVID-related shutdowns. On a regional basis, China led the way for us with stellar 44% growth as demand remains strong. Business activity continued to recover and the Agilent team worked quickly and effectively to start working down the backlog including delivering remaining shipments deferred due to the Shanghai COVID related shutdown in Q2. Europe also exceeded expectations by delivering double-digit growth in the quarter, coming in 14% higher than a year ago, with broad strength across our markets, highlighted by low 20s growth in pharma.  Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group continued its outstanding performance and posted revenue of $1.12 billion. This represents growth of 22% with the instrument business growing 24% and our Consumers and Applied business growing 15%. We also saw excellent low 30s growth in our LC/MS instruments business as our solutions continue to resonate with customers. LSAG was able to build our leadership implied markets with spectroscopy growing in the low 20s and the GC and GC/MS business growing in the low 30s. In addition, Agilent is doing its part to help customers monitor and manage microplastic in the environment as we released the latest version of the 8700 LDIR chemical imaging system. This unique system has been optimized specifically for the analysis of microplastics in environmental samples. The ads on Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $381 million in Q4. This is up 14% core with broad-based strength across our entire portfolio of offerings. Pharma and Chemicals & Advanced Materials both grew mid-teens for ACG. On a regional basis, China led the way with high 20s growth as business continued to recover. ACG also delivered double-digit growth in the Americas. ACG has delivered double-digit growth for us every quarter this year, and our engagement large enterprise customers continues to accelerate. Through its deep understanding and insights into lab operations, the ACG team continues to build strategic partnerships and long-term relationships that maximize customer value and provide ongoing demand for services and support.  The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $352 million, up 8% core. DGG's results were led by strong growth in the low 20s for NASD. As expected, our NASD business delivered high quarterly revenue on a sequential basis given the plant shutdown last quarter. Our genomics portfolio also posted solid results, growing low teens and pathology grew mid-single digits. On a regional basis, DGG also delivered mid-20s growth in China.  In addition to these business group highlights, during Q4, Agilent was recognized by the World Economic Forum Global Lighthouse Network as a world leader in advanced manufacturing. Agilent's manufacturing facility in Singapore received this recognition for deploying innovative technologies at scale in the manufacture of scientific instruments, driving productivity, while advancing sustainability. Also, we are extremely pleased to announce a new multimillion-dollar partnership with Delaware State University, a leading historically black university. The work we will do together with DSU is geared towards increasing the number of underrepresented students entering stem fields.  In addition, Agilent is certified as a great place to work by the Great Place to Work Institute in more than 20 countries and regions around the world during the quarter. This recognition distinguishes Agilent as a top employer based on an independent survey of its global workforce.  Recap in 2022, we had another very successful year, not only on delivering excellent financial results, but building for the future. We continue to drive innovation focused on supporting our customers and executing our Build and Buy strategy to outgrow the market. The Agilent team continues to deliver. We have built a resilient company with multiple drivers for growth and target investments focused on high-growth areas. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that can take on any challenge and execute at an extremely high level. As we look ahead to 2023, we believe these qualities are a winning formula for continuing to deliver in an increasingly uncertain economic environment. Bob will now share more detail on the quarter and the year along with our initial view on expectations for fiscal year 2023. After his remarks, I will rejoin to add some final comments and perspective. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you.\nRobert McMahon: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and the year as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our guidance for fiscal year 2023 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are extremely pleased with our Q4 performance and finished the year on a very strong note, exceeding our expectations on both revenue and earnings per share. Q4 revenue was $1.85 billion, up 17.5% core and 11.4% on a reported basis. During the quarter, we saw the dollar continue to strengthen. Currency exchange rates were a 6.2 point headwind to growth or $103 million. The contribution from M&A was as expected, adding 0.1 point to reported growth. Our performance was again broad-based as all end markets and regions grew during the quarter. Orders also grew again during the quarter, while outstanding execution from our order fulfillment and supply chain teams enabled us to start working down our record backlog. As we enter FY '23, our backlog is still elevated and helps provide good visibility and confidence in our outlook going forward.  Now I'd like to share additional details on our end markets. Results in our largest market pharma were very strong. This market represents 37% of Agilent's revenue and grew 20% in the quarter. Biopharma grew 18% and small molecule was up 21%. Looking forward, we expect the pharma end market to grow high single digits in FY '23. Chemicals and Advanced Materials led growth for us during the quarter at 27%. This compares with 11% growth in Q4 of last year. All three submarkets, Chemicals, Advanced Materials and Energy had strong growth in the quarter. All regions grew as well, led by China. Demand continues to be driven by investments in advanced materials, driving secular growth opportunities in batteries, alternative energy and semiconductors. While not immune to macro uncertainties, we believe these secular drivers in Advanced Materials will continue, helping to drive mid-single-digit growth for this market next year. We delivered growth of 20% in the food market led by China as our results continue to benefit from the recovery of revenue delays due to COVID-related shutdowns in Q2. During FY '23, we expect the food market to normalize and grow in the low single digits after two years of very strong growth. The Environmental & Forensics market posted 18% growth with particular strength in the Americas. This result was driven by increased governmental spending helping to drive technology refresh for newer applications like PFAS testing. Europe and China also posted impressive double-digit growth in the quarter. We see PFAS-related funding and demand continuing to be a driver for this end market and expect mid-single-digit growth next year. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 6% against an 11% compare last year. Growth was led by Europe and China, while Americas grew low single digits. We also expect to see mid-single-digit growth in this market in FY '23. The Academia & Government market grew 3%, led by continued strength in our service business. This market grew 3% overall for the year as well; and looking forward, we expect similar growth in 2023. On a geographic basis, China led the way with phenomenal 44% growth in Q4, driven by underlying demand across multiple end markets and our continued ability to quickly recover deferred revenue from Q2.  As we have discussed the last two quarters, the COVID-related lockdowns in China earlier this year deferred an estimated $50 million to $55 million in revenue from Q2 into future quarters. This recovery started last quarter, and our team in China continued their outstanding work to ramp production and shipments quickly in Q4. We've now fully worked through this deferred revenue a full quarter earlier than originally anticipated back in Q2, a true testament to the entire team. We estimate this recovery had a mid-single-digit positive impact to China's Q4 growth. So even excluding this, our business performance in Q4 was very strong. Now looking ahead to next year, we expect China will continue to be a key growth driver for us. And as Mike mentioned, Europe grew a very solid 14%, which exceeded our expectations. We also posted 8% growth in the Americas, driven by Pharma, Chemicals & Advanced Materials and strong growth in the Environmental & Forensics market, partially offset by Academia & Government. And lastly, the rest of Asia grew 12%.  Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Our team continues to execute at a very high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was 56.3%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Volume leverage, along with pricing, helped overcome continued inflationary pressures and higher logistics costs. Our operating margin was 29.1% in Q4, up 260 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 14% for the quarter as expected, and we had 298 million diluted shares outstanding.  Putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.53 for the quarter, up 26% from a year ago, as Mike mentioned.  So in summary, Q4 ended with 17% core top line growth and 26% EPS growth, a very strong finish to the year, where we had revenue growth of 12% and EPS growth of 20%. Now some metrics on our cash flow and balance sheet. In Q4, we generated operating cash flow of $448 million, while investing $70 million in capital expenditures. The CapEx spending is driven by our continued scale-up of Train B for our NASD expansion. And in the quarter, we also paid out $62 million in dividends and repurchased shares valued at $135 million. For the year, we returned almost $1.4 billion to shareholders through $250 million in dividends and a bit more than $1.1 billion in share repurchases. And as we've indicated before, given the ongoing strength of the business, we believe these share repurchases represent a very good long-term investment.  Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of 0.8.  Now let's move to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. Now looking forward to 2023, we entered the year with business momentum and a very healthy backlog. We also acknowledge the increasingly uncertain macro environment, rising interest rates and currency headwinds and have reflected that in our thinking based on what we know today. For fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $6.9 billion to $7 billion as we have significantly greater currency headwinds since the last we spoke. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 5% to 6.5%, in line with our long-range goals. Currency will negatively affect reported growth by 430 basis points or roughly $295 million during the year based on fiscal year-end rates. And to help with your modeling at a business group level, this revenue guidance assumes mid-single-digit core growth for LSAG, mid- to high single-digit growth for DGG and high single-digit growth for ACG. And despite the ongoing currency headwinds and a continued inflationary environment, we are expecting operating margin expansion for FY '23. Now below the line, we expect $40 million to $50 million of net expense, a tax rate of 13.75%, which is slightly below this year and 297 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2023 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.61 to $5.69. This range represents a growth rate of 7.5% to 9% versus the prior year and incorporates an estimated 4 percentage point headwind due to currency net of our hedging activities. We are also expecting $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in operating cash next year and CapEx of roughly $300 million based on currently approved expansion projects, primarily Train B for NASD. We have also announced raising our dividend 7%, providing our shareholders with another source of value.  And finally, for Q1 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.70 billion. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 6.8% to 8%, while currency will be a 6.6 point headwind to reported growth. This outlook for the quarter incorporates the impact of the timing of Lunar New Year this year. First quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $1.29 and $1.31. Mike will speak to this further in just a minute, but our diversified business model and the strength of our team are key assets for Agilent. These two elements produced an outstanding Q4 and a full year 2022 and they have put us in an excellent position to again deliver strong results in the coming year.  And now I will turn the floor back over to Mike for some closing comments. Mike?\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Bob. Today's results are a strong indication that Agilent has the right growth strategies, the right team and right culture to continue delivering strong results. Our customers know we are reliable, resilient and extremely quick in reacting to meet their needs. The Agilent team continues to work hard to earn their trust. Looking ahead, we are all seeing increasing economic uncertainty. However, this company and team have built to successfully navigate any economic challenges we may encounter. Throughout the pandemic, we have stated that Agilent will emerge as a stronger company. Today's results are yet another proof point that we are well on our way in this journey, and we're not done yet. We continue to prioritize investments in growth. We are a resilient company with multiple growth drivers and unmatched execution capabilities. I'm quite confident we will continue to react quickly to changing conditions and deliver at a high level. Thanks for being on the call. And now I will turn things back over to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Mike. Bo, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question this afternoon from Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar : Congratulations on a really impressive finish to the year here. Mike or Bob, maybe if I could start with the high-level fiscal '23 guidance question. 5% to 6.5% organic for the year, that's coming off of some tough comps. Maybe just talk about your assumptions for end markets which you're expecting for forma chemicals and advanced materials, et cetera. Just given your commentary on orders and backlog, it looks like the start 5% to 6.5%, it seems reasonably conservative.\nMike McMullen: Why don't you take that?\nRobert McMahon : Yes, Vijay, yes, I appreciate the comments on the end of the year. And as we mentioned, we're moving into FY '23 with momentum. And really, what we've seen across our business in FY '22, we are expecting to continue into FY '23. Broad-based business results really led by our two largest markets, Pharma and Chemicals & Advanced Materials. And when we think about those, those are both in the mid- to high single-digit growth range and with growth in the other areas as well. We're expecting all of our markets to grow and really given some of the secular drivers that we've seen this year and continued strength in the pharma business.\nMike McMullen: Hey, Bob, I would just add, too. This is our initial guide for the year. We're at the top end of our long growth model in terms of the long-term growth aspirations we laid out at our last [AID] coming off two straight years of double-digit growth. And its initial guide of the year, Vijay. And you probably hear a few times they were being prudent given the increasing economic uncertainty out there. But I would point out that if you look at the core growth rate assumptions, the Q1 '22 guide is actually higher than the full year number.\nVijay Kumar : Mike, I appreciate the prudent comment. And if I could just have one follow-up on. On margins, that EPS guide came in about Street models despite FX headwinds, it looks like coming in about Street models. What are you assuming for pricing inflation? And what's implied from margin expansion in the guide?\nMike McMullen: You want to take that, Bob?\nRobert McMahon : Yes. Yes. So we ended Q4 in a very good position here with a little over 4% and that has ramped throughout the year, and we're forecasting roughly about a little over 3% in price next year across our book of business. And we are assuming margin expansion, Vijay, next year. And when we look at that 7.5% to 9%, what we are seeing is kind of unprecedented strength in currency. And we do hedge, but our hedges become less effective over time. And we're -- that's absorbing a 4-point headwind. So if you added that back in, it would be closer to 11.5% to 13% EPS growth.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Matt Life with Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Sykes: Appreciate it. Maybe I just want to dig a little bit more into the margins. You guys mentioned operating margin expansion expectations for next year. But maybe talk a little bit about where you see those drivers coming from, maybe on a segment basis or an end market basis? Where do you feel there's more upside to expand those margins at the group level and where the impact will be felt?\nRobert McMahon : Yes, I think what you would see is a continuation of what we've been able to do this year. And what we've been able to do is cover the increase in costs associated with the inflation through the pricing activities, but then really leveraging our operating expenses. And you saw that in full display here in where we did have operating -- gross margin expansion, but you also saw a majority of the margin expansion in the operating expense. And I think that that's 1 of the benefits that we have through the investments that we've been making in digital over time, as Mike mentioned, as well as the continued effort around the One Agilent focus. So I would expect us to continue to see that I do think that the scale that we have across our businesses will continue to provide benefits next year, certainly, as we drive more business into our service organization. I do think that we will continue to be able to leverage that footprint. And then if you look at the higher growth areas that we've been investing in, in the instrumentation side of the business, those are our more profitable businesses. And we are also looking to continue to attach -- increase our attach rates both on the services but then also consumables, which are 1 of our highest profit.  And I would say in Diagnostics, the DGG business, we are facing kind of some of the start-up costs with our Train B next year. But if you peel the onion, I would say, fundamentally, our business is performing very well there as well in '23. And I would expect margin improvement outside of kind of some onetime start-up costs that we would have in bringing that train up and running in the second half of the year.\nMatt Sykes : Got it. Then maybe a question on the Chemicals & Advanced Materials. You guys made a comment in the slide deck about increased demand in the energy business during Q4. Could you talk about the drivers behind that? And what your expectations are, specifically for the energy market as we move through '23?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So we really wanted to make sure that it was clear that across all three segments of the CAM segment, we saw growth. And what you're seeing going on here is a lot of investments in the HPI industry given the strength of their businesses. So -- and I'll have Jacob jump on this as well, I think their businesses with the ability to invest and they have a lot of deferred investments over the years, but also a lot of new money going into renewable and green energy initiatives as well.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, I think you're right, Mike. I think we're seeing, as you mentioned, there has been some pause in the capital equipment investment over the years, and we're definitely seeing that coming back. So -- and both in the HPI, but also in the renewable energy, we continue to see a lot of strength, and we believe that will continue forward.\nMike McMullen: Yes, we're expecting that trend to continue into '23.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll go next now to Puneet Souda of SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda : Mike, Bob, thanks for taking the question. I mean to say this is impressive as a quarter is an understatement in the sort of uncertain times. So first of all, congrats on the quarter. Mike, so on China, impressive results there. Can you just parse that out a bit? I know you talked about gas chromatography delays were there, and those are -- it looks like they're fully booked in this quarter and the revenues booked or food is also impressive. Could you maybe talk about the order book visibility you have in China and your growth expectations there going forward despite the Lunar Year? And also, what is the longer-term expectation for overall growth in China, just given the multiple end markets that are working so well for you in the quarter?\nMike McMullen: Yes, sure, Puneet. Happy to respond and Bob and I probably can have tag team on this. But again, thanks for your earlier comments, brought a lot of smiles in the room here. Yes, we were quite pleased with the results for China, not only in the quarter but for the year. And I think it's important to know the 44% print we had in Q4 wasn't just about catch-up from deferred revenue due to the COVID; and again, shutdowns. And again, it points to the fact that when you do see those types of things happen, eventually, the business does materialize. We didn't lose any business. I think the strength of the business continues to be there across multiple end markets, really been led by pharma, chemical. And then we think that the food market will probably normalize to kind of the traditional growth rates in China. But expecting pharma and the CAM marketplace to be strong, in particular, a lot of -- we expect a lot of business on the renewable energy and HPI side in China as well. So that Advanced Materials segment, we've been talking a lot about, we think is going to sustain the growth in China in '23. But I think we're kind of looking at maybe high singles for China for next year. Is our initial thinking?\nRobert McMahon : Yes, that's right. And Puneet, I would say the strength that we saw in Q4 in China was really across the board across all the major technology platforms within the instrument business. The consumables business was incredibly strong as well. And then the services business, if you recall back in Q3, we said that activity hadn't fully come back, was fully back in Q4. And so we saw very strong there. And not to forget, DGG. We had double-digit growth in our Diagnostics and Genomics business as well. So it was really broad-based. And you talked about visibility, orders continue to grow in China. And we have very good visibility in -- certainly into the first half of this year. And as we think about the secular growth drivers, those are still in place. If you think about the investments that are made in technologies around the biotechnology areas, but increasingly actually in advanced materials and some of the secular drivers around batteries and lithium-ion production and so forth. And we would expect that to continue into next year for sure.\nMike McMullen: Bob, I just have to think to your comment about the DGG business. Just a reminder, Puneet as we came into this year, we created a unique structure as part of our one commercialization to have all of our China businesses we put into one single leader. Really, the idea was to add scale to the parts of our business, which we felt underrepresented, and you saw the payoff already starting to happen with the growth rate in DGG, for example.\nPuneet Souda : That's great. Just quick one on pharma. I mean this was the first quarter in a long time when I saw small molecules growing faster than biomolecules. Can you elaborate a bit what's behind that dynamic?\nMike McMullen: I thought it was really good newsprint because we've been talking lately about that while we still continue to believe that biopharma large molecules will have the inherently higher growth rate, we've also been pointing the fact that the small molecule will continue to have growth. And I think it speaks to some of the strength of particularly our LC and LC/MS business in small molecule. And Jacob, I'll have you add a few comments here in a second. I wouldn't overread too much in that particular quarter. It's just one quarter. I think we would expect to continue to see over time a differentiation in the growth rates between biopharma and small molecule, but small molecule by no means is dead and it's an opportunity for growth. And I think we've got a great portfolio there, Jacob.\nJacob Thaysen : Yes. Right, Mike. Oh, sorry, I was on mute here. So sorry, this was Jacob coming with some comments. But you're absolutely right, Mike. We continue to see the small molecule being -- while it's still the largest part of our business, of course, we see biopharma as a great opportunity, but we take the small molecule business very seriously and continue to build full workflow solutions for that, particularly for the LC and LC/MS space, and that's where the growth is coming from. \nMike McMullen: Thanks, Jacobs.\nOperator: We go next to now to Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.\nBrandon Couillard : Mike or Bob, I can't remember. You mentioned the PFAS market several times in the prepared remarks. Can you just give us a ballpark size of how big that market is right now, maybe relative growth rates and whether it's primarily a U.S.-centric market or if it's developing in other parts of the world as well?\nMike McMullen: So Jacob, how if you and I tag team on this? We're viewing this, I think, about a $200 million market, growing double digit. We think while there's -- a lot of the growth is centered in the U.S., there's also going to be very strong growth in the U.S. and perhaps some in China. So we actually see this as a sort of a global story with initial big legs in U.S. and Europe and the growing interest in China. But let me see if I got that right, Jacob?\nJacob Thaysen : Yes, you're absolutely right, Mike. It's a huge market. And in fact, there was more than 4 billion put aside in the infrastructure build for PFAS testing, not only for analytical instrument, obviously, but overall for PFAS testing. So this is a great opportunity. And it's particularly a great opportunity for us as this requires -- it's very high-sensitivity instruments you need and you have run very easily into issues in your sample, perhaps you don't take that very seriously. So really building out the flow solutions and have something that works every time. We spend a lot of energy on that. And in fact, we have a solution now that lives up to all the EPA regulations and our customers just love it because it's just plug and play, and it works very well for them for very sophisticated ways of doing business here.  And on top of that, while most of the opportunity sits in the LC/MS space. We're also starting to see the GC/MS as an opportunity to look at testing of PFAS molecules in the year and all the volatile, so which speaks extremely well to our opportunity.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Jacob, for those build. And this is the first time in my tenure where that we've seen this kind of money coming in, in the U.S. marketplace with the government support. So it's a very encouraging trend, and we think that trend is going to be with us into '23.\nBrandon Couillard : That's great. Then a couple for Bob. Just number one, can you just quantify the Lunar New Year impact in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. And then with supply chain loosening, which it sounds like they are, what are the implications for that in terms of working capital as you move through the balance of the year?\nRobert McMahon : Yes. Brandon, thanks for the questions. Yes, the Lunar New Year is roughly a little over 0.5 point impact year-on-year for headwind had in our first quarter. It starts in mid-January this year versus the first of February last year. And so -- and for those that will come back to us in the second quarter. And then I think in terms of supply chain, -- it is -- we think it is improving, but it's not back to kind of pre-COVID levels, both on the standpoint of being able to get products to customers, but also procuring raw materials and the costs associated with that. We do think that that's going to improve over time. I would say I wouldn't expect any changes -- any material changes certainly in the first half of the year and then maybe some slight changes as we get into the back half of the year. But -- we do think it is improving, but we've increased our stocks of critical supplies. And I don't think it will go back to pre-COVID levels in terms of how we're running that just to ensure that we have the ability to flex when we need to if there were challenges around logistics across the world.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Daniel Brennan of Cowen.\nDaniel Brennan : Congrats on the quarter. Maybe just the first one, just on LSAG. Another really impressive quarter with 24% growth on the instruments. So the mid-single-digit guide, obviously, you're up against tough comps, but it does reflect the notable slowdown from what you guys have been doing. And maybe just walk through a little bit of what kind of drove the strength this quarter kind of end market versus Agilent specific? And then is there just a healthy degree of conservatism baked in for the guide? Or is it really just tough comps?\nRobert McMahon : Yes. I would say at the beginning, Dan, we're at the beginning of the year, there are uncertainties out there, as I'd repeat what Mike said, it's beginning of the year and that's a prudent guide. I would say that there's an element of tough comps, particularly in the second half of the year as we have been building -- taking down the backlog certainly in China, which was China just a deferral from Q2 into the second half of the year.  But I would say, fundamentally, the demand is still strong. And I think across the end markets, our expectation is that the Pharma and Chemical & Advanced Materials markets will continue to lead the way for us with faster-than-expected growth, I think, in Environmental & Forensics for that PFAS testing.\nMike McMullen: Maybe just a couple of additional comments here, Bob, maybe Jacob, you have thoughts as well. But we continue to see improving market share. So the latest industry stats from -- showed us all green across all platforms. So that should bring to -- and any kind of debate on whether or not we're picking up share. But I also think it's kind of also recognize we've been in kind of an unprecedented environment here for a number of quarters in a row where we've seen instrument growth rates in 20s plus, 30 plus. A lot of it -- and we've been very transparent about this in all our calls that an element of that it's tied to an accelerated replacement cycle in some end markets, in some technologies. So we're thinking though, as we set up the guide for '23, we should assume some return to more normalized replacement rates in certain end markets but there's going to be growth there, but perhaps not at the same rate we've seen. And I don't know if you have any additional thoughts there, Jacob.\nJacob Thaysen : No, I think we\u2019re good, Mike.\nMike McMullen: Okay. Cool. I got it right. I'm 2 for 2 today.\nDaniel Brennan : And then maybe just a follow-up. I know you've already discussed in the Chemical & Advanced Materials, a really strong quarter. And then on the outlook. I'm just wondering for the mid-single-digit guide obviously, the Advanced Material portion is like 1/3 of that business. It sounds like that's expected to grow really strong. Maybe just give us a flavor for how you're thinking about the three subcomponents in the '23. And like is there anything baked in on the chemical side of the energy side that would reflect some kind of impact from a selling economy? Or just kind of how should we think about that mid-single digit.\nMike McMullen: I'm going to invite Padraig on this too because he's working with his team very closely on this. But we're taking a cautious outlook as it relates to the chemical industry in Europe, particularly -- and I want to separate that from what maybe happened relative to the HPI and renewable energies. But in the base chemical business, our large customers are having to work through higher input costs to their production. So we're assuming a cautious outlook from that particular segment in Europe. And Padraig I know you are from that part of the world, and I know that you've been talking to our team about this as well. Anything you'd add?\nPadraig McDonnell : Yes. No, I think it's cautious, Mike. And I think what we're seeing is that there's additional scrutiny being played on converting quotes to orders that we're seeing across, particularly in Europe. And of course, there's quite a lot of macroeconomic pressures there as well. So I think you're spot-on on that one.\nRobert McMahon : The only thing I would say, Dan, this is Bob, to add is this is an area -- sometimes people ask us, this would be an area of potential upside? If things continue the way that they are, there would be an opportunity for upside in this end market, given the strength that we're seeing.\nMike McMullen: Absolutely, Bob.\nOperator: And we'll go next now to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal : So first up on Train B. Last quarter, you guys said that there were some supply chain delays as you guys were building up that manufacturing line. So can you just give us the latest on timing if you're still on track for that to come online mid fiscal year.? And then thinking about beyond Train B, you guys have hinted at potential capacity expansions beyond this. So can you give us the latest on your thinking on those capacity expansions and when we could hear an update there?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So Sam, why don't you take the first part, and I'll close with the second part?\nSam Raha : Yes. It sounds good. Rachel, thank you for the question, and happy to report there haven't been any changes since we last spoke about Train B and timing. We're on track to go live in the middle of the calendar year coming up in 2023.\nMike McMullen: And at the risk of being repetitive, Rachel, we're on record saying that there's more letters than the alphabets in A&B. So we're focused on getting Train B up and running and have it generating revenue in '23. But at the same time, we continue to explore possible expansion plans, and nothing yet to announce yet, but stay tuned.\nRachel Vatnsdal : Great. And then just one more follow-up on food. So food grew 20% this quarter. It sounds like some of that was from that China recovery and pull forward there. But all in, you're guiding to low single digits next year off of that two year stacked tough comps. So can you just walk us through how should we be thinking about the food market going forward? Do you think in 2024, it's going to normalize more at a low single digit? Or is this market really accelerated and the guide this year is just more on that typical comp.\nRobert McMahon : Yes, it's a good question. And this is Bob. And I would say it wasn't pull forward, it was catch up in terms of the growth rate here because it was -- as you know, Rachel, China has got a bigger proportion of the food market. And I would say it is a function of having two years of very strong performance there and so difficult comps. And I do think it is trending up with some of the investments that are being made there. But this still is a low to mid-single-digit grower.\nMike McMullen: I think just to kind of reinforce our ability to hit that mid-single or low to mid-single-digit growth rates, we also see continued strength in the U.S., for example, where our cannabis testing business is part of what we reported, so, right Jacob?\nJacob Thaysen : Yes, correct. And the cannabis business continues to do very well, and we see a lot of lab owners that is looking for us to come in and help them to equip the full laboratories. So that's a big opportunity for us. But also the alternative protein space is really picking up, both here in U.S., but particularly also in in Asia. So I do believe that is going to continue to be a secular growth driver for us in food.\nMike McMullen: Right. And I really wanted to make sure that we highlight those new secular growth drivers because a lot of growth historically has come from China. We're seeing actually a much more diversified mix of business as we move forward. \nOperator: We go next now to Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: So Mike, you said it\u2019s an unprecedented environment for instrument demand and such. We've been covering these markets a long time, you and I and looking at these, and these are just numbers, which are really just amazing instrumentation numbers. So what's embedded for instrument growth in your 2023 guide? And how much of this is already covered by your backlog versus what's going to be new or have to get in through the year?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So yes, thanks, Derik. And you and I have been in this business for a while and eye-popping growth rates, that's why we love -- we've really been joining these growth rates. I do think there's elements in the market that actually have increased the long-term growth rates relative what we've seen in the past. But I think it's also fair to assume that some of these accelerated replacement cycle seen will start to moderate over time. That being said, Bob, I think we're looking at LSAG, what, in the mid-singles?\nRobert McMahon : Mid-single. That's correct.\nMike McMullen: And I'll let you pick the second part of the question there.\nRobert McMahon : Yes, yes. So it is mid-single digits. What I would say, Derik, is we're not going to disclose the amount of contribution for our backlog in there. But you can imagine that, that healthy backlog that we just talked about is primarily on the instrument side. It's just the way that we book business. And we have pretty good visibility into the first half of the year just given the way our order trends happened.\nDerik De Bruin : Got it. Can we talk a little bit about the academic market and what you're seeing there? Low single digits there in the quarter, low single-digit demand. How is that sort of like tracking relative to your expectations? I mean, I know you don't have a huge academic footprint, but I know your genomics business was actually doing -- they actually did -- was actually quite strong in the quarter. So I'm just wondering if you could sort of talk through what's going on in that market and sort of are you seeing any pressures there?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So Bob, maybe we can tag team on this, and I'll start. So first of all, this is the one market that we always coming out of COVID said will be the slowest to recover, and that's still proven to be the case. We saw really, really good demand in China in Academia & Government and also good demand for certain aspects of our portfolio. But at the same point in time, a level of caution is around CapEx. NIH funding is not as robust as people had hoped. So we've tempered our outlook for '23 as kind of just a continuation of more and more of the same.\nRobert McMahon : Yes. And I would say, Derik, the growth that we had met our expectations right down the line; and as Mike said, stronger in places like China, and less so in the U.S. but it met our overall expectations. And that's kind of how we're expecting it in FY '23 as well.\nDerik De Bruin : And I have to ask the obligatory M&A question. Your share is obviously a good choice right now, but anything peaking your interest, valuation starting to come in on some of the stragglers in the market?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So thanks for that, Derik. And as you know, we've got this Build and Buy growth strategy and one aspect of it is to look for opportunities for us to add great new businesses and team to Agilent through the use of our balance sheet. And as you may recall, some of our calls in the early part of '22, wow, these -- and finished out when these valuations were really out of site. And we saw that both in the public, but also in the private space. And things are starting to actually moderate down. So nothing at all to announce, but I'd say that the activities are -- we are very active here, and we're getting to places where you can see deals happening that would work for shareholders. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Jack Meehan of Nephron.\nJack Meehan : I wanted to keep going on the instrument side. I was wondering if you could comment on cancellation trends. So just in context of the broader macro uncertainty, is that showing up anywhere in your instrument backlog?\nMike McMullen: Yes, Jack, thanks for that question because one of the reasons why we have the confidence we have with the outlook we've guided to -- and when Bob talks about elevated backlogs, it's a healthy backlog. In that we have no significant change. There's no significant order cancellations, remain very low. So the orders we have in backlog will ship and we feel really good about the -- if you will, the quality of our backlog.\nRobert McMahon : Yes, Jack, just to build on that, the other piece -- the first piece of that would be our orders being pushed out, and we're not even seeing that either. So we're not seeing any push out of orders as well as any cancellations.\nJack Meehan : Awesome. Okay. And then kind of the other pressure area we've been monitoring is more in the bioprocessing side, just stocking trends at customers. I know you compete sort of adjacent to some of these markets on large molecule. Are you seeing any destocking activity in any of the markets that you serve?\nMike McMullen: No, no. Thanks for that question, Jack, because we've been reading some of the print as well, and we're saying, well, that's really not what we all were seeing with our business. So you saw -- and Jacob, we posted what double-digit 15% growth in CSD. We saw low teens growth in the genomics area, which would be the area you might see those things. And so it's not a concern for our ongoing business. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly : Maybe following up another one on the instrument side. I know you aren't going to give a hard number on the backlog. You did mention it was still elevated, Mike, and obviously gives us some good visibility into next year. I mean, any way you can frame kind of what it looks like today going into kind of a year compared to historicals? And then just on the order growth, what did that look like in the quarter? Obviously, the past few quarters, you called out outgrew revenue nicely. I'm just trying to get a feel for that, maybe if you have it on a geographic basis as well, that would be helpful?\nMike McMullen: Yes, sure. So I think backlog remains up over historic exit levels. And that's why we very carefully chose the word elevated in our text to make sure that that you know there's more gas to left in the tank. While we won't give you a specific growth rate, I will tell you that we again grew our orders in Q4 off a prior year double-digit compare. I do think it's also worth pointing out, though, we did see a different trend within the quarter. So -- and I think this speaks to our confidence around the year-end revenues because customers were ordering earlier in the quarter in like August and through September, really to make sure they got product by the fiscal year. So that was probably the only thing that we saw a little bit different than historical patterns, if I remember correctly, Bob? And then I think the story was pretty much across the board geographically.\nRobert McMahon : Yes. Correct. Correct.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Same story.\nPatrick Donnelly : That's helpful. And then maybe sticking on the geographic point. Can you just talk about Europe, what you're seeing there? I mean, there's been concerns about tightening capital spend just given the geopolitical environment, the energy side. Maybe what you're seeing there? And then maybe a second one on the order side. Just the budget flush, you guys tend to have a decent look at it at this point. I know it's still a little bit away, but any early indications there would be helpful?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So relative to Europe, I think I'd just remind you, we had a 14% print in the quarter. So we really feel good about our performance relative to the competition in that part of the world. But this area is a watch out for us. The -- a lot of the economic -- future economic concerns are really sending around what may happen to the European economy, particularly with the energy prices that they're having to deal with and what does it mean for demand and the ability for our customers to have the profitable revenue streams they want for their business. So that's an area that we're watching, and that's why we've taken this prudent guide in for example, assuming what will happen on the chemical side of Europe.\nRobert McMahon : Yes, I was going to say there's really nothing -- it's an area -- as Mike, you said, it's an area that we're watching. We haven't seen any material change in the way things are operating there. Just to add on that 14% was against a year ago that we did have revenue in Russia. And so that 14% was even higher than that if you looked at it on a pro forma basis. So\u2026\nDerik De Bruin : Great. And any quick thoughts on the budget flush would be helpful. I appreciate.\nRobert McMahon: Yes, stay tuned. What I would say is, I mean, we have -- as Mike said, I think we did see some of that in our order book in Q4 given some of the extended delivery times that are still out there between us and the rest of the market. But we're not assuming any greater than kind of normal budget flush for the end of the year.\nRobert McMahon: Correct.\nOperator: We will go next to Josh Waldman at Cleveland Research.\nJoshua Waldman : A couple for you. First, Mike, a lot of questions on instrumentation, so I'll ask on CrossLab. A nice quarter here. I wondered if you could talk through the drivers to the acceleration? Anything beyond just the comps? I mean are you guys seeing signs of higher adoption of contracted service, share benefit. Is this a category where maybe price is just now starting to come into the mix?\nMike McMullen: Yes, absolutely. So I'm going to tag team with Padraig on this one, but I think all those factors are hitting, and we're going to talk about services, but I think it's important to know that between services and consumables, we actually crossed over the 30% connect rate for the first time in the fourth quarter. So we've been talking about the importance of connect rates going forward. And on the services side, which is where your question is centered is, we've seen an acceleration of growth. We hinted at some of the places we're doing really well at the big enterprise level. But Padraig, why don't you add some your thoughts on here? Because this is your business and a lot of good things happening here.\nPadraig McDonnell : Yes. I think, Mike, as you said, touch rates continue to be very strong, and it's much more than a break/fix business and we see our contract rates actually growing at double digits, which is incredibly sticky with customers. And all key offering categories right from enterprise down to some of the preventive maintenance services we do are all very, very strong. We also see that, of course, we have a large installed base and being able to provide different solutions and services for that have been really great. I will close by saying that we had some very big wins in the enterprise service business, and that's where we really look about productivity of labs and how we help customers with their outcomes, and we're seeing that increase as we go through the quarter and through the year.\nJoshua Waldman : Then Bob or Mike, curious to get your updated thoughts on supply chain and what you're seeing from a component availability and cost perspective entering '23? And I guess, whether or not your guide assumes improvements in either of these or maybe if supply chain improvement could represent upside to the guide?\nRobert McMahon : Yes. I would say we have seen in the second half of this year, incremental improvements as we went through Q3 and Q4 that helped us allow us to increase our revenue here in Q4. I would expect that incremental improvement to continue into next year. But it's by no means back to kind of normal I think if it happens to improve, I do think that, that would be a good thing for us. And -- but we're not -- we're assuming kind of the same level of improvement that we've seen in the back half of this year moving into FY '23. I do think that some of the costs have come down but there we're still having to purchase things in the aftermarket to be able to ensure supply and deliver to customers.\nMike McMullen: Yes, to Josh's question, if we get to a point where we don't have to go into that aspect of the market, that would be upside for us.\nRobert McMahon : That's right.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Dan Leonard of Credit Suisse. \nDan Leonard : Mike, I have a follow-up on Europe. So when you're framing the possibilities for 2023, I hear you on the conservatism for the chemical industry. But what about other end markets? Does the macro uncertainty in Europe bleed into pharma or aca, gov or anywhere else?\nMike McMullen: We think there's an element that will also be in pharma as well. So you're right. I was focusing specifically on the Chemical segment of Europe, but that's also part of the storyboard as well. You can manage large pharma accounts who are dealing with increased costs, trying to figure out what they want to do in 2023. So that's a watch area for us as well. But I will say, some of the other secular drivers that we talked about earlier, such as investments in renewable energy, there's a big push to make hydrogen more of a source of energy. So this plays right in the sweet spot of Agilent. So -- but we are cautious about the large accounts in Europe and what they may do in '23 in those two end markets.\nDan Leonard : And then I have an unrelated follow-up. On the NASD business, can you be specific about what is your outlook for that business in 2023? And what might be your opportunity to expand the service offerings in that business beyond your traditional product offering?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Sam you know might obviously take a lead on that just to kind of -- and then have Bob jump in here as well. I mean we're assuming that our new capacity for Train B comes online, mid-year calendar year, it starts and will reach I believe full capacity by the end of the year. And we do think there's further expansion opportunities both in terms of what we do already, but broadening the portfolio. But Bob, maybe you want to walk through some of the thoughts on the financial expectations.\nRobert McMahon : Yes. I mean we ended this year touching on roughly $300 million for that business, and we've talked about this Train B being $150 million plus of capacity when Mike says we're going to be at capacity at that run rate by the end of the fiscal year. And you could imagine that probably less than half of that is a ramp-up, but we would expect a strong growth here. And I would say Train B is primarily siRNA, although we do have early -- some growing business in CRISPR Therapeutics out of our existing facilities, and we expect that to continue to grow as well. \nOperator: We go next now to Dan Arias of Stifel.\nDaniel Arias : Hey, Mike, just a question on GC/MS. 30% growth for the quarter is pretty robust. For '23, would you expect a little bit of a decoupling from LC/MS there just given that it feels like there's more -- a little bit more cyclicality on the GC side, maybe a little bit more pharma on the LC side? Or do you think those portfolios track similarly again?\nMike McMullen: I think we've always felt -- and Jacob, feel free to jump in this. We've always felt that long term, we expected LC/MS to have higher growth rates than GC/MS. And I think we'd expect that to play out in the long run. I'm not sure about '23 because GC/MS plays really well in the advanced materials space. We've been talking about some of the secular drivers there. But also, as Jacob mentioned, PFAS is an area, too. So I don't know if we're going to see that much divergence in '23, but it's a great question. I haven't thought about it.\nJacob Thaysen : Yes. Thanks, Mike. And we came out with some very nice innovations here at the ASMS on the GC/MS side, including the way that you can use hydrogen to measure or to as your carrier gas and set up the helium, which has been really nice pickup in the GC/MS space. And as Mike also alluded to, I think we are seeing a lot of opportunity in the Advanced Materials side, particularly in the lithium battery side, where we both see our spectroscopy portfolio combined with the GC, GC/MS is completely or really addressing some of the challenges there. And actually on top of that, you have LC that is a part of that equation as you also want to look at electrolytes in batteries. So I think we continue to see a lot of opportunities in Advanced Materials, but particularly for the GC, GC/MS side.\nDaniel Arias : Yes. Okay. Interesting. And then, Bob, maybe just thinking about investments next year in the context of the growth that you're seeing this year, are there areas where you might add resources beyond what might just be expected given the uncertainty that's floating around? Seems like there's an opportunity to sort of improve your positioning at a time of strength, not sure if you're seeing it that way, though.\nRobert McMahon : Yes. No, we agree. And I would say it's -- we've been doing that over the course of this last year. And I would say one of the areas, obviously, we're building out the capacity in NASD that we've talked about extensively. But we're also significantly investing in places like digital and software. And we think that that's an area of increasing strength for us and would look to continue to invest incrementally there as we go into FY '23. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions this afternoon. Mr. Ahuja, I'll turn things back to you for closing comments.\nParmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bo, and thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of the day. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and the year as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our guidance for fiscal year 2023 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are extremely pleased with our Q4 performance and finished the year on a very strong note, exceeding our expectations on both revenue and earnings per share. Q4 revenue was $1.85 billion, up 17.5% core and 11.4% on a reported basis. During the quarter, we saw the dollar continue to strengthen. Currency exchange rates were a 6.2 point headwind to growth or $103 million. The contribution from M&A was as expected, adding 0.1 point to reported growth. Our performance was again broad-based as all end markets and regions grew during the quarter. Orders also grew again during the quarter, while outstanding execution from our order fulfillment and supply chain teams enabled us to start working down our record backlog. As we enter FY '23, our backlog is still elevated and helps provide good visibility and confidence in our outlook going forward.  Now I'd like to share additional details on our end markets. Results in our largest market pharma were very strong. This market represents 37% of Agilent's revenue and grew 20% in the quarter. Biopharma grew 18% and small molecule was up 21%. Looking forward, we expect the pharma end market to grow high single digits in FY '23. Chemicals and Advanced Materials led growth for us during the quarter at 27%. This compares with 11% growth in Q4 of last year. All three submarkets, Chemicals, Advanced Materials and Energy had strong growth in the quarter. All regions grew as well, led by China. Demand continues to be driven by investments in advanced materials, driving secular growth opportunities in batteries, alternative energy and semiconductors. While not immune to macro uncertainties, we believe these secular drivers in Advanced Materials will continue, helping to drive mid-single-digit growth for this market next year. We delivered growth of 20% in the food market led by China as our results continue to benefit from the recovery of revenue delays due to COVID-related shutdowns in Q2. During FY '23, we expect the food market to normalize and grow in the low single digits after two years of very strong growth. The Environmental & Forensics market posted 18% growth with particular strength in the Americas. This result was driven by increased governmental spending helping to drive technology refresh for newer applications like PFAS testing. Europe and China also posted impressive double-digit growth in the quarter. We see PFAS-related funding and demand continuing to be a driver for this end market and expect mid-single-digit growth next year. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 6% against an 11% compare last year. Growth was led by Europe and China, while Americas grew low single digits. We also expect to see mid-single-digit growth in this market in FY '23. The Academia & Government market grew 3%, led by continued strength in our service business. This market grew 3% overall for the year as well; and looking forward, we expect similar growth in 2023. On a geographic basis, China led the way with phenomenal 44% growth in Q4, driven by underlying demand across multiple end markets and our continued ability to quickly recover deferred revenue from Q2.  As we have discussed the last two quarters, the COVID-related lockdowns in China earlier this year deferred an estimated $50 million to $55 million in revenue from Q2 into future quarters. This recovery started last quarter, and our team in China continued their outstanding work to ramp production and shipments quickly in Q4. We've now fully worked through this deferred revenue a full quarter earlier than originally anticipated back in Q2, a true testament to the entire team. We estimate this recovery had a mid-single-digit positive impact to China's Q4 growth. So even excluding this, our business performance in Q4 was very strong. Now looking ahead to next year, we expect China will continue to be a key growth driver for us. And as Mike mentioned, Europe grew a very solid 14%, which exceeded our expectations. We also posted 8% growth in the Americas, driven by Pharma, Chemicals & Advanced Materials and strong growth in the Environmental & Forensics market, partially offset by Academia & Government. And lastly, the rest of Asia grew 12%.  Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Our team continues to execute at a very high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was 56.3%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. Volume leverage, along with pricing, helped overcome continued inflationary pressures and higher logistics costs. Our operating margin was 29.1% in Q4, up 260 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 14% for the quarter as expected, and we had 298 million diluted shares outstanding.  Putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.53 for the quarter, up 26% from a year ago, as Mike mentioned.  So in summary, Q4 ended with 17% core top line growth and 26% EPS growth, a very strong finish to the year, where we had revenue growth of 12% and EPS growth of 20%. Now some metrics on our cash flow and balance sheet. In Q4, we generated operating cash flow of $448 million, while investing $70 million in capital expenditures. The CapEx spending is driven by our continued scale-up of Train B for our NASD expansion. And in the quarter, we also paid out $62 million in dividends and repurchased shares valued at $135 million. For the year, we returned almost $1.4 billion to shareholders through $250 million in dividends and a bit more than $1.1 billion in share repurchases. And as we've indicated before, given the ongoing strength of the business, we believe these share repurchases represent a very good long-term investment.  Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of 0.8.  Now let's move to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. Now looking forward to 2023, we entered the year with business momentum and a very healthy backlog. We also acknowledge the increasingly uncertain macro environment, rising interest rates and currency headwinds and have reflected that in our thinking based on what we know today. For fiscal year 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $6.9 billion to $7 billion as we have significantly greater currency headwinds since the last we spoke. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 5% to 6.5%, in line with our long-range goals. Currency will negatively affect reported growth by 430 basis points or roughly $295 million during the year based on fiscal year-end rates. And to help with your modeling at a business group level, this revenue guidance assumes mid-single-digit core growth for LSAG, mid- to high single-digit growth for DGG and high single-digit growth for ACG. And despite the ongoing currency headwinds and a continued inflationary environment, we are expecting operating margin expansion for FY '23. Now below the line, we expect $40 million to $50 million of net expense, a tax rate of 13.75%, which is slightly below this year and 297 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2023 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.61 to $5.69. This range represents a growth rate of 7.5% to 9% versus the prior year and incorporates an estimated 4 percentage point headwind due to currency net of our hedging activities. We are also expecting $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in operating cash next year and CapEx of roughly $300 million based on currently approved expansion projects, primarily Train B for NASD. We have also announced raising our dividend 7%, providing our shareholders with another source of value.  And finally, for Q1 2023, we expect revenue in the range of $1.68 billion to $1.70 billion. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 6.8% to 8%, while currency will be a 6.6 point headwind to reported growth. This outlook for the quarter incorporates the impact of the timing of Lunar New Year this year. First quarter 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $1.29 and $1.31. Mike will speak to this further in just a minute, but our diversified business model and the strength of our team are key assets for Agilent. These two elements produced an outstanding Q4 and a full year 2022 and they have put us in an excellent position to again deliver strong results in the coming year.  And now I will turn the floor back over to Mike for some closing comments. Mike? Yes, Vijay, yes, I appreciate the comments on the end of the year. And as we mentioned, we're moving into FY '23 with momentum. And really, what we've seen across our business in FY '22, we are expecting to continue into FY '23. Broad-based business results really led by our two largest markets, Pharma and Chemicals & Advanced Materials. And when we think about those, those are both in the mid- to high single-digit growth range and with growth in the other areas as well. We're expecting all of our markets to grow and really given some of the secular drivers that we've seen this year and continued strength in the pharma business. Yes. Yes. So we ended Q4 in a very good position here with a little over 4% and that has ramped throughout the year, and we're forecasting roughly about a little over 3% in price next year across our book of business. And we are assuming margin expansion, Vijay, next year. And when we look at that 7.5% to 9%, what we are seeing is kind of unprecedented strength in currency. And we do hedge, but our hedges become less effective over time. And we're -- that's absorbing a 4-point headwind. So if you added that back in, it would be closer to 11.5% to 13% EPS growth. Yes, I think what you would see is a continuation of what we've been able to do this year. And what we've been able to do is cover the increase in costs associated with the inflation through the pricing activities, but then really leveraging our operating expenses. And you saw that in full display here in where we did have operating -- gross margin expansion, but you also saw a majority of the margin expansion in the operating expense. And I think that that's 1 of the benefits that we have through the investments that we've been making in digital over time, as Mike mentioned, as well as the continued effort around the One Agilent focus. So I would expect us to continue to see that I do think that the scale that we have across our businesses will continue to provide benefits next year, certainly, as we drive more business into our service organization. I do think that we will continue to be able to leverage that footprint. And then if you look at the higher growth areas that we've been investing in, in the instrumentation side of the business, those are our more profitable businesses. And we are also looking to continue to attach -- increase our attach rates both on the services but then also consumables, which are 1 of our highest profit.  And I would say in Diagnostics, the DGG business, we are facing kind of some of the start-up costs with our Train B next year. But if you peel the onion, I would say, fundamentally, our business is performing very well there as well in '23. And I would expect margin improvement outside of kind of some onetime start-up costs that we would have in bringing that train up and running in the second half of the year. Yes, that's right. And Puneet, I would say the strength that we saw in Q4 in China was really across the board across all the major technology platforms within the instrument business. The consumables business was incredibly strong as well. And then the services business, if you recall back in Q3, we said that activity hadn't fully come back, was fully back in Q4. And so we saw very strong there. And not to forget, DGG. We had double-digit growth in our Diagnostics and Genomics business as well. So it was really broad-based. And you talked about visibility, orders continue to grow in China. And we have very good visibility in -- certainly into the first half of this year. And as we think about the secular growth drivers, those are still in place. If you think about the investments that are made in technologies around the biotechnology areas, but increasingly actually in advanced materials and some of the secular drivers around batteries and lithium-ion production and so forth. And we would expect that to continue into next year for sure. Yes. Brandon, thanks for the questions. Yes, the Lunar New Year is roughly a little over 0.5 point impact year-on-year for headwind had in our first quarter. It starts in mid-January this year versus the first of February last year. And so -- and for those that will come back to us in the second quarter. And then I think in terms of supply chain, -- it is -- we think it is improving, but it's not back to kind of pre-COVID levels, both on the standpoint of being able to get products to customers, but also procuring raw materials and the costs associated with that. We do think that that's going to improve over time. I would say I wouldn't expect any changes -- any material changes certainly in the first half of the year and then maybe some slight changes as we get into the back half of the year. But -- we do think it is improving, but we've increased our stocks of critical supplies. And I don't think it will go back to pre-COVID levels in terms of how we're running that just to ensure that we have the ability to flex when we need to if there were challenges around logistics across the world. Yes. I would say at the beginning, Dan, we're at the beginning of the year, there are uncertainties out there, as I'd repeat what Mike said, it's beginning of the year and that's a prudent guide. I would say that there's an element of tough comps, particularly in the second half of the year as we have been building -- taking down the backlog certainly in China, which was China just a deferral from Q2 into the second half of the year.  But I would say, fundamentally, the demand is still strong. And I think across the end markets, our expectation is that the Pharma and Chemical & Advanced Materials markets will continue to lead the way for us with faster-than-expected growth, I think, in Environmental & Forensics for that PFAS testing. The only thing I would say, Dan, this is Bob, to add is this is an area -- sometimes people ask us, this would be an area of potential upside? If things continue the way that they are, there would be an opportunity for upside in this end market, given the strength that we're seeing. Yes, it's a good question. And this is Bob. And I would say it wasn't pull forward, it was catch up in terms of the growth rate here because it was -- as you know, Rachel, China has got a bigger proportion of the food market. And I would say it is a function of having two years of very strong performance there and so difficult comps. And I do think it is trending up with some of the investments that are being made there. But this still is a low to mid-single-digit grower. Mid-single. That's correct. Yes, yes. So it is mid-single digits. What I would say, Derik, is we're not going to disclose the amount of contribution for our backlog in there. But you can imagine that, that healthy backlog that we just talked about is primarily on the instrument side. It's just the way that we book business. And we have pretty good visibility into the first half of the year just given the way our order trends happened. Yes. And I would say, Derik, the growth that we had met our expectations right down the line; and as Mike said, stronger in places like China, and less so in the U.S. but it met our overall expectations. And that's kind of how we're expecting it in FY '23 as well. Yes, Jack, just to build on that, the other piece -- the first piece of that would be our orders being pushed out, and we're not even seeing that either. So we're not seeing any push out of orders as well as any cancellations. Yes. Correct. Correct. Yes, I was going to say there's really nothing -- it's an area -- as Mike, you said, it's an area that we're watching. We haven't seen any material change in the way things are operating there. Just to add on that 14% was against a year ago that we did have revenue in Russia. And so that 14% was even higher than that if you looked at it on a pro forma basis. So\u2026 Yes, stay tuned. What I would say is, I mean, we have -- as Mike said, I think we did see some of that in our order book in Q4 given some of the extended delivery times that are still out there between us and the rest of the market. But we're not assuming any greater than kind of normal budget flush for the end of the year. Correct. Yes. I would say we have seen in the second half of this year, incremental improvements as we went through Q3 and Q4 that helped us allow us to increase our revenue here in Q4. I would expect that incremental improvement to continue into next year. But it's by no means back to kind of normal I think if it happens to improve, I do think that, that would be a good thing for us. And -- but we're not -- we're assuming kind of the same level of improvement that we've seen in the back half of this year moving into FY '23. I do think that some of the costs have come down but there we're still having to purchase things in the aftermarket to be able to ensure supply and deliver to customers. That's right. Yes. I mean we ended this year touching on roughly $300 million for that business, and we've talked about this Train B being $150 million plus of capacity when Mike says we're going to be at capacity at that run rate by the end of the fiscal year. And you could imagine that probably less than half of that is a ramp-up, but we would expect a strong growth here. And I would say Train B is primarily siRNA, although we do have early -- some growing business in CRISPR Therapeutics out of our existing facilities, and we expect that to continue to grow as well. Yes. No, we agree. And I would say it's -- we've been doing that over the course of this last year. And I would say one of the areas, obviously, we're building out the capacity in NASD that we've talked about extensively. But we're also significantly investing in places like digital and software. And we think that that's an area of increasing strength for us and would look to continue to invest incrementally there as we go into FY '23."

I think we're seeing, as you mentioned, there has been some pause in the capital equipment investment over the years, and we're definitely seeing that coming back. So -- and both in the HPI, but also in the renewable energy, we continue to see a lot of strength, and we believe that will continue forward. Yes. Right, Mike. Oh, sorry, I was on mute here. So sorry, this was Jacob coming with some comments. But you're absolutely right, Mike. We continue to see the small molecule being -- while it's still the largest part of our business, of course, we see biopharma as a great opportunity, but we take the small molecule business very seriously and continue to build full workflow solutions for that, particularly for the LC and LC/MS space, and that's where the growth is coming from. Yes, you're absolutely right, Mike. It's a huge market. And in fact, there was more than 4 billion put aside in the infrastructure build for PFAS testing, not only for analytical instrument, obviously, but overall for PFAS testing. So this is a great opportunity. And it's particularly a great opportunity for us as this requires -- it's very high-sensitivity instruments you need and you have run very easily into issues in your sample, perhaps you don't take that very seriously. So really building out the flow solutions and have something that works every time. We spend a lot of energy on that. And in fact, we have a solution now that lives up to all the EPA regulations and our customers just love it because it's just plug and play, and it works very well for them for very sophisticated ways of doing business here.  And on top of that, while most of the opportunity sits in the LC/MS space. We're also starting to see the GC/MS as an opportunity to look at testing of PFAS molecules in the year and all the volatile, so which speaks extremely well to our opportunity. No, I think we\u2019re good, Mike. Yes, correct. And the cannabis business continues to do very well, and we see a lot of lab owners that is looking for us to come in and help them to equip the full laboratories. So that's a big opportunity for us. But also the alternative protein space is really picking up, both here in U.S., but particularly also in in Asia. So I do believe that is going to continue to be a secular growth driver for us in food. Yes. Thanks, Mike. And we came out with some very nice innovations here at the ASMS on the GC/MS side, including the way that you can use hydrogen to measure or to as your carrier gas and set up the helium, which has been really nice pickup in the GC/MS space. And as Mike also alluded to, I think we are seeing a lot of opportunity in the Advanced Materials side, particularly in the lithium battery side, where we both see our spectroscopy portfolio combined with the GC, GC/MS is completely or really addressing some of the challenges there.

We delivered an excellent quarter, significantly exceeding our revenue and earnings expectations.  Revenue of $1.85 billion is up more than 17% core. Our strong top line performance helped deliver fourth quarter operating margins of 29.1%. The operating margins continue to expand despite the inflationary environment and the strengthening dollar and are up 260 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.53 were up 26%. These Q4 results mark an outstanding finish to another strong year for Agilent\u2019s fiscal 2022. The full year revenue of $6.85 billion, we delivered core revenue growth of 12%. This is on top of core revenue growth of 15% in 2021. Our operating margin continued to increase and a 27.1% for the year, up 160 basis points. Earnings per share of $5.22 per share, up 20% for the year. Rx result this year highlight the ongoing strength of our diversified business and shine a light on the multiple growth drivers we put in place over the years. They also continue to demonstrate the outstanding execution capabilities of the Agilent team. Throughout the year, we navigated market uncertainties, inflation, COVID-related shutdowns and supply chain and logistics constraints. Our strength is broad-based with all three business groups growing double digits for the year. All major geographies and regions grew double digits in FY '22 after adjusting from our exit from Russia. This was highlighted by China leading the way, growing 18%. From an end market perspective, all markets expanded led by excellent growth in our two largest markets, Pharma and Chemical & Advanced Materials. All in all, it was an extremely good year for Agilent.  Let's now take a closer look at our fourth quarter performance, starting with end market highlights. During Q4, our performance led by 20%-plus growth in three of our six end markets. Pharma, our largest market, posted 20% growth on top of 21% in Q4 last year. The Chemicals & Advanced Materials business grew 27%. We saw robust demand in chemicals, along with secular growth in semiconductors, batteries and other advanced materials. The food market also grew 20% on a strong end-of-year demand in China that have been previously delayed by COVID-related shutdowns. On a regional basis, China led the way for us with stellar 44% growth as demand remains strong. Business activity continued to recover and the Agilent team worked quickly and effectively to start working down the backlog including delivering remaining shipments deferred due to the Shanghai COVID related shutdown in Q2. Europe also exceeded expectations by delivering double-digit growth in the quarter, coming in 14% higher than a year ago, with broad strength across our markets, highlighted by low 20s growth in pharma.  Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group continued its outstanding performance and posted revenue of $1.12 billion. This represents growth of 22% with the instrument business growing 24% and our Consumers and Applied business growing 15%. We also saw excellent low 30s growth in our LC/MS instruments business as our solutions continue to resonate with customers. LSAG was able to build our leadership implied markets with spectroscopy growing in the low 20s and the GC and GC/MS business growing in the low 30s. In addition, Agilent is doing its part to help customers monitor and manage microplastic in the environment as we released the latest version of the 8700 LDIR chemical imaging system. This unique system has been optimized specifically for the analysis of microplastics in environmental samples. The ads on Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $381 million in Q4. This is up 14% core with broad-based strength across our entire portfolio of offerings. Pharma and Chemicals & Advanced Materials both grew mid-teens for ACG. On a regional basis, China led the way with high 20s growth as business continued to recover. ACG also delivered double-digit growth in the Americas. ACG has delivered double-digit growth for us every quarter this year, and our engagement large enterprise customers continues to accelerate. Through its deep understanding and insights into lab operations, the ACG team continues to build strategic partnerships and long-term relationships that maximize customer value and provide ongoing demand for services and support.  The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $352 million, up 8% core. DGG's results were led by strong growth in the low 20s for NASD. As expected, our NASD business delivered high quarterly revenue on a sequential basis given the plant shutdown last quarter. Our genomics portfolio also posted solid results, growing low teens and pathology grew mid-single digits. On a regional basis, DGG also delivered mid-20s growth in China.  In addition to these business group highlights, during Q4, Agilent was recognized by the World Economic Forum Global Lighthouse Network as a world leader in advanced manufacturing. Agilent's manufacturing facility in Singapore received this recognition for deploying innovative technologies at scale in the manufacture of scientific instruments, driving productivity, while advancing sustainability. Also, we are extremely pleased to announce a new multimillion-dollar partnership with Delaware State University, a leading historically black university. The work we will do together with DSU is geared towards increasing the number of underrepresented students entering stem fields.  In addition, Agilent is certified as a great place to work by the Great Place to Work Institute in more than 20 countries and regions around the world during the quarter. This recognition distinguishes Agilent as a top employer based on an independent survey of its global workforce.  Recap in 2022, we had another very successful year, not only on delivering excellent financial results, but building for the future. We continue to drive innovation focused on supporting our customers and executing our Build and Buy strategy to outgrow the market. The Agilent team continues to deliver. We have built a resilient company with multiple drivers for growth and target investments focused on high-growth areas. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that can take on any challenge and execute at an extremely high level. As we look ahead to 2023, we believe these qualities are a winning formula for continuing to deliver in an increasingly uncertain economic environment. Bob will now share more detail on the quarter and the year along with our initial view on expectations for fiscal year 2023. After his remarks, I will rejoin to add some final comments and perspective. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you. Thanks, Bob. Today's results are a strong indication that Agilent has the right growth strategies, the right team and right culture to continue delivering strong results. Our customers know we are reliable, resilient and extremely quick in reacting to meet their needs. The Agilent team continues to work hard to earn their trust. Looking ahead, we are all seeing increasing economic uncertainty. However, this company and team have built to successfully navigate any economic challenges we may encounter. Throughout the pandemic, we have stated that Agilent will emerge as a stronger company. Today's results are yet another proof point that we are well on our way in this journey, and we're not done yet. We continue to prioritize investments in growth. We are a resilient company with multiple growth drivers and unmatched execution capabilities. I'm quite confident we will continue to react quickly to changing conditions and deliver at a high level. Thanks for being on the call. And now I will turn things back over to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet? Why don't you take that? Hey, Bob, I would just add, too. This is our initial guide for the year. We're at the top end of our long growth model in terms of the long-term growth aspirations we laid out at our last [AID] coming off two straight years of double-digit growth. And its initial guide of the year, Vijay. And you probably hear a few times they were being prudent given the increasing economic uncertainty out there. But I would point out that if you look at the core growth rate assumptions, the Q1 '22 guide is actually higher than the full year number. You want to take that, Bob? Yes. So we really wanted to make sure that it was clear that across all three segments of the CAM segment, we saw growth. And what you're seeing going on here is a lot of investments in the HPI industry given the strength of their businesses. So -- and I'll have Jacob jump on this as well, I think their businesses with the ability to invest and they have a lot of deferred investments over the years, but also a lot of new money going into renewable and green energy initiatives as well. Yes, we're expecting that trend to continue into '23. Yes, sure, Puneet. Happy to respond and Bob and I probably can have tag team on this. But again, thanks for your earlier comments, brought a lot of smiles in the room here. Yes, we were quite pleased with the results for China, not only in the quarter but for the year. And I think it's important to know the 44% print we had in Q4 wasn't just about catch-up from deferred revenue due to the COVID; and again, shutdowns. And again, it points to the fact that when you do see those types of things happen, eventually, the business does materialize. We didn't lose any business. I think the strength of the business continues to be there across multiple end markets, really been led by pharma, chemical. And then we think that the food market will probably normalize to kind of the traditional growth rates in China. But expecting pharma and the CAM marketplace to be strong, in particular, a lot of -- we expect a lot of business on the renewable energy and HPI side in China as well. So that Advanced Materials segment, we've been talking a lot about, we think is going to sustain the growth in China in '23. But I think we're kind of looking at maybe high singles for China for next year. Is our initial thinking? Bob, I just have to think to your comment about the DGG business. Just a reminder, Puneet as we came into this year, we created a unique structure as part of our one commercialization to have all of our China businesses we put into one single leader. Really, the idea was to add scale to the parts of our business, which we felt underrepresented, and you saw the payoff already starting to happen with the growth rate in DGG, for example. I thought it was really good newsprint because we've been talking lately about that while we still continue to believe that biopharma large molecules will have the inherently higher growth rate, we've also been pointing the fact that the small molecule will continue to have growth. And I think it speaks to some of the strength of particularly our LC and LC/MS business in small molecule. And Jacob, I'll have you add a few comments here in a second. I wouldn't overread too much in that particular quarter. It's just one quarter. I think we would expect to continue to see over time a differentiation in the growth rates between biopharma and small molecule, but small molecule by no means is dead and it's an opportunity for growth. And I think we've got a great portfolio there, Jacob. Thanks, Jacobs. So Jacob, how if you and I tag team on this? We're viewing this, I think, about a $200 million market, growing double digit. We think while there's -- a lot of the growth is centered in the U.S., there's also going to be very strong growth in the U.S. and perhaps some in China. So we actually see this as a sort of a global story with initial big legs in U.S. and Europe and the growing interest in China. But let me see if I got that right, Jacob? Yes. Thanks, Jacob, for those build. And this is the first time in my tenure where that we've seen this kind of money coming in, in the U.S. marketplace with the government support. So it's a very encouraging trend, and we think that trend is going to be with us into '23. Maybe just a couple of additional comments here, Bob, maybe Jacob, you have thoughts as well. But we continue to see improving market share. So the latest industry stats from -- showed us all green across all platforms. So that should bring to -- and any kind of debate on whether or not we're picking up share. But I also think it's kind of also recognize we've been in kind of an unprecedented environment here for a number of quarters in a row where we've seen instrument growth rates in 20s plus, 30 plus. A lot of it -- and we've been very transparent about this in all our calls that an element of that it's tied to an accelerated replacement cycle in some end markets, in some technologies. So we're thinking though, as we set up the guide for '23, we should assume some return to more normalized replacement rates in certain end markets but there's going to be growth there, but perhaps not at the same rate we've seen. And I don't know if you have any additional thoughts there, Jacob. Okay. Cool. I got it right. I'm 2 for 2 today. I'm going to invite Padraig on this too because he's working with his team very closely on this. But we're taking a cautious outlook as it relates to the chemical industry in Europe, particularly -- and I want to separate that from what maybe happened relative to the HPI and renewable energies. But in the base chemical business, our large customers are having to work through higher input costs to their production. So we're assuming a cautious outlook from that particular segment in Europe. And Padraig I know you are from that part of the world, and I know that you've been talking to our team about this as well. Anything you'd add? Absolutely, Bob. Yes. So Sam, why don't you take the first part, and I'll close with the second part? And at the risk of being repetitive, Rachel, we're on record saying that there's more letters than the alphabets in A&B. So we're focused on getting Train B up and running and have it generating revenue in '23. But at the same time, we continue to explore possible expansion plans, and nothing yet to announce yet, but stay tuned. I think just to kind of reinforce our ability to hit that mid-single or low to mid-single-digit growth rates, we also see continued strength in the U.S., for example, where our cannabis testing business is part of what we reported, so, right Jacob? Right. And I really wanted to make sure that we highlight those new secular growth drivers because a lot of growth historically has come from China. We're seeing actually a much more diversified mix of business as we move forward. Yes. So yes, thanks, Derik. And you and I have been in this business for a while and eye-popping growth rates, that's why we love -- we've really been joining these growth rates. I do think there's elements in the market that actually have increased the long-term growth rates relative what we've seen in the past. But I think it's also fair to assume that some of these accelerated replacement cycle seen will start to moderate over time. That being said, Bob, I think we're looking at LSAG, what, in the mid-singles? And I'll let you pick the second part of the question there. Yes. So Bob, maybe we can tag team on this, and I'll start. So first of all, this is the one market that we always coming out of COVID said will be the slowest to recover, and that's still proven to be the case. We saw really, really good demand in China in Academia & Government and also good demand for certain aspects of our portfolio. But at the same point in time, a level of caution is around CapEx. NIH funding is not as robust as people had hoped. So we've tempered our outlook for '23 as kind of just a continuation of more and more of the same. Yes. So thanks for that, Derik. And as you know, we've got this Build and Buy growth strategy and one aspect of it is to look for opportunities for us to add great new businesses and team to Agilent through the use of our balance sheet. And as you may recall, some of our calls in the early part of '22, wow, these -- and finished out when these valuations were really out of site. And we saw that both in the public, but also in the private space. And things are starting to actually moderate down. So nothing at all to announce, but I'd say that the activities are -- we are very active here, and we're getting to places where you can see deals happening that would work for shareholders. Yes, Jack, thanks for that question because one of the reasons why we have the confidence we have with the outlook we've guided to -- and when Bob talks about elevated backlogs, it's a healthy backlog. In that we have no significant change. There's no significant order cancellations, remain very low. So the orders we have in backlog will ship and we feel really good about the -- if you will, the quality of our backlog. No, no. Thanks for that question, Jack, because we've been reading some of the print as well, and we're saying, well, that's really not what we all were seeing with our business. So you saw -- and Jacob, we posted what double-digit 15% growth in CSD. We saw low teens growth in the genomics area, which would be the area you might see those things. And so it's not a concern for our ongoing business. Yes, sure. So I think backlog remains up over historic exit levels. And that's why we very carefully chose the word elevated in our text to make sure that that you know there's more gas to left in the tank. While we won't give you a specific growth rate, I will tell you that we again grew our orders in Q4 off a prior year double-digit compare. I do think it's also worth pointing out, though, we did see a different trend within the quarter. So -- and I think this speaks to our confidence around the year-end revenues because customers were ordering earlier in the quarter in like August and through September, really to make sure they got product by the fiscal year. So that was probably the only thing that we saw a little bit different than historical patterns, if I remember correctly, Bob? And then I think the story was pretty much across the board geographically. Yes. Same story. Yes. So relative to Europe, I think I'd just remind you, we had a 14% print in the quarter. So we really feel good about our performance relative to the competition in that part of the world. But this area is a watch out for us. The -- a lot of the economic -- future economic concerns are really sending around what may happen to the European economy, particularly with the energy prices that they're having to deal with and what does it mean for demand and the ability for our customers to have the profitable revenue streams they want for their business. So that's an area that we're watching, and that's why we've taken this prudent guide in for example, assuming what will happen on the chemical side of Europe. Yes, absolutely. So I'm going to tag team with Padraig on this one, but I think all those factors are hitting, and we're going to talk about services, but I think it's important to know that between services and consumables, we actually crossed over the 30% connect rate for the first time in the fourth quarter. So we've been talking about the importance of connect rates going forward. And on the services side, which is where your question is centered is, we've seen an acceleration of growth. We hinted at some of the places we're doing really well at the big enterprise level. But Padraig, why don't you add some your thoughts on here? Because this is your business and a lot of good things happening here. Yes, to Josh's question, if we get to a point where we don't have to go into that aspect of the market, that would be upside for us. We think there's an element that will also be in pharma as well. So you're right. I was focusing specifically on the Chemical segment of Europe, but that's also part of the storyboard as well. You can manage large pharma accounts who are dealing with increased costs, trying to figure out what they want to do in 2023. So that's a watch area for us as well. But I will say, some of the other secular drivers that we talked about earlier, such as investments in renewable energy, there's a big push to make hydrogen more of a source of energy. So this plays right in the sweet spot of Agilent. So -- but we are cautious about the large accounts in Europe and what they may do in '23 in those two end markets. Yes. Sam you know might obviously take a lead on that just to kind of -- and then have Bob jump in here as well. I mean we're assuming that our new capacity for Train B comes online, mid-year calendar year, it starts and will reach I believe full capacity by the end of the year. And we do think there's further expansion opportunities both in terms of what we do already, but broadening the portfolio. But Bob, maybe you want to walk through some of the thoughts on the financial expectations. I think we've always felt -- and Jacob, feel free to jump in this. We've always felt that long term, we expected LC/MS to have higher growth rates than GC/MS. And I think we'd expect that to play out in the long run. I'm not sure about '23 because GC/MS plays really well in the advanced materials space. We've been talking about some of the secular drivers there. But also, as Jacob mentioned, PFAS is an area, too. So I don't know if we're going to see that much divergence in '23, but it's a great question. I haven't thought about it."

In the third quarter, we once again demonstrated the strength of our diversified business and the unstoppable One Agilent team. We delivered an excellent quarter, significantly exceeding our revenue and earnings expectations. Revenues of $1.72 billion are up 13% core. This is on top of 21% core growth in Q3 of 2021. Third quarter operating margin of 27.5%. Operating margins continue to expand and are up 150 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.34, up 22%. Our strong results in Q3, coupled with orders continuing to outpace revenues, highlight the ongoing strength of our diversified business. The momentum in our business continues, and we once again raised our outlook for the year. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our Q3 results. From an end-market perspective, our results were once again led by strength in our two largest markets, pharma and chemical energy. Our largest market, pharma, grew 16% versus 27% a year ago. Within pharma, both the biopharma and small molecule segments grew double-digits. The momentum in our C&E market segment continues with Q3 growth of 22%. This is on top of 23% growth a year ago. The C&E market is being fueled by demand in chemicals, along with strong secular demand and ongoing investment within the advanced materials space. We are also very pleased to achieve double-digit growth in the food and environmental and forensic markets with both markets growing 11%. In our last call, I shared our belief that the business impact of the Shanghai COVID-19 lockdown would be transitory. I also expressed that we remain confident about the ongoing strength of our business in China. In Q3, the China delivered 29% growth. These stellar results were driven by continued strong end-market demand, coupled with the faster-than-expected recovery of production and shipment activity following the end of the Shanghai area lockdown. We are also very pleased with its results, which highlights the customer focus, drive and outstanding execution of the Agilent China team. Strength in Americas continued as we posted another quarter of double-digit growth on top of 32% growth last year. Our European business grew 6% against 23% last year despite a 2 point headwind for the curtailment of our operations in Russia. In terms of business unit performance, the Life Science and Applied [Technical Difficulty] revenues of $1.02 billion, up 18% on a core basis. Growth was broad-based but continued strong demand for our LC and LC/MS offerings, where we posted high 20s growth. Our spectroscopy business grew low 30s driven by strength in the advanced materials market. Chemistries and consumables, cell analysis and our GC business each delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. LSAG\u2019s end-market growth is broad-based with particular strength in the pharma and chemical and energy markets. Our pharma results were driven by strength in the biopharma segment, which grew more than 20%. We had an excellent showing at the recent ASMS conference, introducing several important LC/MS and GC/MS instruments and biopharma workflow solutions. These innovative and intelligent LC/MS and GC/MS systems have been designed to make the lives of our customers easier. To build an instrument intelligence and a higher level instrument diagnostics helped maximize system uptime and improve lab productivity by allowing operators to focus on their analysis rather than their instruments. In addition, we introduced an industry-first hydro in net source for GC single-quad and GC Triple-Quad instruments, enabling customers to seamlessly migrate from helium as a supplier gas to lower-cost hydrogen. And rounding out the list of new products announced at ASMS, we introduced the mass Hunter BioConfirm 12.0 software, an integrated compliant workflow, targeted at the fast growing oligo-based therapy development market. These new products have already been well received by customers and represent the latest addition to Agilent history of leadership in mass spectrometry. Our LSAG business also won some important awards during the quarter, including the 6560c i-Mobility LCT system, winning the Scientist Choice Award for Best New Spectroscopy product. Earlier this month, we also strengthened and broadened our advanced materials and biopharma portfolio with the acquisition of PSS, Polymer Standard Service, a leader in polymer characterization. We are extremely pleased to welcome the PSS team and their technology to the Agilent family. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenue of $359 million. This is up 10% core. We grew 10% core even as lab activity continues to ramp in China. Growth in services was again broad-based across services contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. Strong instrument placements and increased connect rates continue to be a driver for our service business as customers continue to see value in our ACG offerings. Another critical important factor on our results is the scale and execution capability of Agilent\u2019s world-class global service delivery organization in service of customers to meet their needs. Agilent was seen as the trusted company to work with among our global customers. The Diagnostic and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $340 million, up 3% core. This is diverse compare a 37% growth last year. The solid results in our clinical cancer testing and NGS businesses were partially offset by COVID testing headwinds in a Q PCR portfolio. In addition, the DGG business in China continues to ramp from the COVID-related shutdowns there. NASD revenues were up modestly in line with expectations. As we noted last quarter, Q3 included the impact of a planned shutdown, our oligo manufacturing line in Frederick, Colorado. The shutdown of Frederick was for both routine maintenance and development of key elements of our Train B. Our new manufacturing line have increased our capacity $150 million plus when fully ramped. While we continue to make good progress in the construction of Train B, we have seen some supply chain-related delays and are now targeted a midyear 2023 go-live, a slight delay. We see continued strong demand for oligo-based therapies as the number of approved drugs continues to increase and the pipeline of drugs in development are targeting disease states with larger patient populations. We are more confident than ever in the long-term trajectory of the market and our business. In addition to these highlights, I\u2019d like to also point the recent release of Agilent\u2019s 2021 ESG report. While we\u2019ve always published our progress in sustainability and addressing societal needs, this year, we\u2019ve taken our approach to the next level. We address these issues a new format that for the first time that looks specifically at our progress in the areas of environmental, social and governance issues. We hope you have a chance to review our progress in ESG by checking out the report on the Agilent website, learning more about how we\u2019re executing our mission to advance the quality of life. Agilent\u2019s Q3 results again point to the strength of our diversified business and the outstanding execution ability of the Agilent team. We continue to bring innovative, differentiated new offerings in the marketplace. Acceleration in digital orders growth continues as well as new customer acquisition. In addition, as we started 2022, we undertook a bold move to create One Agilent commercial organization to further drive customer focus and growth. The strength in our portfolio and the continued strong execution by our One Agilent commercial organization make a powerful combination, and you see it in the results we\u2019re delivering. Customer satisfaction hit another all-time high this quarter. We continue to outgrow the market. As a result of our strong Q3 performance and continued momentum, we\u2019re once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Bob will share more of the specifics. It\u2019s an exciting time at Agilent with the best yet to come. Thank you for being on the call today. And now I will hand the call off to Bob. Bob?\nBob McMahon: Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I will then finish up with our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are extremely pleased with our Q3 performance. Results were above expectations, and we expect that strength to continue in the fourth quarter. Q3 revenues were $1.72 billion, up 8.4% on a reported basis and up 13.2% core. FX was a 4 point headwind to growth or $76 million. Pricing for the quarter contributed over 3 points of growth year-on-year and improved sequentially. The performance was broad-based as all end markets and regions grew during the quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, the COVID-related lockdowns in China deferred an estimated $50 million to $55 million in revenue from Q2, and we forecasted that revenue would be recovered during the rest of the calendar year. Our team in China did a fantastic job ramping production and shipments faster than expected following the shutdowns. We estimate over half of that deferred total was delivered in Q3, exceeding our expectations. Given the strong performance, we now expect the remainder will be delivered in Q4, which is an acceleration from our thinking from last quarter. The acceleration of the COVID-related shutdown recovery in China contributed to an already strong Q3 for the company. For perspective, we estimate the total business grew double digits, excluding the accelerated recovery. As Mike mentioned, earnings per share of $1.34 were up 22% from a year ago, representing strong incremental flow-through of the better-than-expected revenue growth. This performance is against our most difficult comparison of the year as EPS grew 41% in Q3 of last year. Now let me dive a little deeper into the end markets. Our largest market, pharma, was up 16%, exceeding our expectations. Biopharma grew 18% and small molecule was up 14%. Biopharma is a focus area for us and now represents 38% of our overall pharma business. We expect that ratio to continue to climb over time. In addition, all 3 business groups grew double digits in the pharma segment. And our LC portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% in this important market for us. Chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 22% during the quarter, driven by the chemicals and advanced materials segment of this market. We saw strength in plastics and packaging for chemicals and ongoing demand in advanced materials coming from the markets for semiconductors and batteries. In the food segment, we achieved growth of 11% on top of 12% growth a year ago. Strength in the food market was led by the Americas and China. Our environmental and forensics market also grew 11% during the quarter, driven by the Americas and China. In the Americas, we saw increased funding to support PFAS testing, while China experienced faster-than-expected recovery post the Shanghai shutdowns for GC and GC/MS. The academia and government market grew 5% on top of a 12% comparison last year, in line with expectations. And rounding out the review of our end markets, our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 2% against a very strong 28% compare versus last year. While not material at the Agilent level, this market did experience some headwinds associated with COVID-related revenues being lower than last year. Excluding this, the growth would have been mid-single digits in this quarter. On a geographic basis, China led the way with 29% growth driven by underlying demand and a faster-than-expected recovery following the COVID-related lockdowns. And looking forward, demand in China continues to be very strong. The Americas grew 11%, another strong showing, and Europe grew 6%, which exceeded expectations. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Our team continues to execute at a very high level. Third quarter gross margin was 56.4%, up 50 basis points from a year ago as pricing actions, volume and productivity helped to offset inflationary pressures tied to ongoing supply chain challenges and higher logistics costs. Operating expense leverage, driven by the strong top line and continued attention to cost management, helped to deliver very healthy margin improvements. Our operating margin was 27.5%, up 150 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 14% for the quarter as expected, and we had 299 million diluted shares outstanding. Looking at cash flow and our balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $326 million in the quarter while investing $82 million in capital expenditures during Q3, driven by our NASD expansion. During the quarter, we also repurchased $323 million worth of shares. We paid out $62 million in dividends in Q3, returning a combined total of $385 million to shareholders in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have purchased over $1 billion of shares. Given the ongoing strength of the business, we believe this is a very good investment. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy with a net leverage ratio of 1. Now let\u2019s move to our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter. We now expect revenues for the full year to be in the range of $6.75 billion to $6.775 billion. This takes into account our Q3 results and an improved outlook in Q4, partially offset by an additional $40 million headwind associated with the strengthening of the dollar. This represents core revenue growth of between 9.9% and 10.3%. We are also raising our EPS guidance for the year to a range of $5.06 to $5.08, representing 17% growth year-on-year. This translates to Q4 revenue in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.775 billion. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11.8%, while exchange rates will be a 5-point headwind, and M&A will contribute 0.1 points. In closing out our Q4 guidance, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.40, up 14% to 16% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14% tax rate and 299 million diluted shares outstanding. The Agilent team once again performed extremely well in Q3, delivering strong results, driving excellent execution and building a strong foundation for the future. Our diversified business and most importantly, our team have put us in an excellent position to again deliver strong results in Q4. And now back to Parmeet, as we take your questions. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks Bob. Hannah, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nMatt Sykes: Hey, good afternoon, Mike and Bob. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the questions.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon, Matt.\nMatt Sykes: Maybe just starting on LSAG, where you had a really good quarter, just interested to know, one, what drove the operating margin expansion in the quarter relative to your expectations last year? And then specifically, I know it was broad-based strength across instrument categories, but was there one or two areas that really surprised you to the upside where you feel is either underappreciated or could see continued momentum in the back half of the calendar year?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So I will take the first part of that and we will jump in and have Bob and Jacob add their thoughts here as well. So, I think relative to the strength and why the operating margin was so high is one is, I think we have been \u2013 we rightly benefited from the leverage impact of having those higher-than-expected revenues. But more importantly, we have been working on the pricing side and really ensuring that we are receiving the value for our offerings. And Bob, I think we are well over 3 points of price appreciation overall for the portfolio in LSAG, I believe.\nBob McMahon: That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s correct.\nMike McMullen: And we are \u2013 as you may have picked up in my script, it was across the board a great quarter for LSAG and across all product categories. But Jacob, I think a couple really stood out for you, didn\u2019t they?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. I think, as we know, we continue to do really well in the LC/MS space, but this quarter is really a spectroscopy that was standing out. We have \u2013 especially in our atomic spectroscopy field we have really seen a lot of momentum based, of course, on the dynamics in the markets, but also the innovation that has been created over the past years. And I think we really see the impact of that these days.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think it was a real race to see who had the highest growth, right, spectroscopy or LC/MS. They both did extremely well.\nMatt Sykes: Great. And then maybe just as a follow-up, I know Europe \u2013 yes, I just say for a follow-up. Can you hear me?\nMike McMullen: Yes, yes, yes.\nMatt Sykes: Yes, sorry. Just for a follow-up on Europe, 6% growth. I think getting a lot of questions on just the spend environment in that region. What are you seeing there? And are there any kind of concerns you might have in terms of demand either from the currency fluctuations or just overall demand in certain end-markets within Europe?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Sure, Matt. So we posted a 6% growth rate \u2013 core growth in the third quarter, albeit there was actually 2 points of headwind for the containment of our Russian operations. So really it was high single-digit, 8%, on a restated basis. And Europe clearly is a watch area for us, but we haven\u2019t seen any significant signals of movement to the downside.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I think, Matt, to build on what Mike is saying, I think in particular we continue to see very strong growth in our pharma business and that really is a global phenomenon. And \u2013 but we also saw very nice growth in our chemical and energy businesses as well. And so as Mike mentioned, it is a watch area, but the demand \u2013 from what we are seeing in the health of the order funnel continues to be there.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nBrandon Couillard: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Mike, could you elaborate just on the core order growth that you saw in the third quarter? And given the strength of order momentum over the last several periods, how does that inform kind of your initial thoughts on \u201823? I mean, should we still think about 5% to 7% still being relevant? And then Bob, should we expect normal 30% to 40% incrementals next year, any headwinds to consider, maybe the new ASP line?\nMike McMullen: Brandon, we are probably not ready to talk about \u201823, but what I\u2019ll leave you with is a couple of thoughts here, which is very clearly the business has momentum and/or even though we had the highest revenue quarter ever for Agilent in this recent third quarter, we still build backlog both globally and also in China. So, our orders that exceeded our revenues in those. So, it sets us up nicely, I think for \u201823, but we\u2019ll get to \u201823 guide when we get there.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And I think, Brandon, on your core incrementals, I mean, I think that if you look at historically, that\u2019s where we have been. Obviously, we do have some startup costs in \u201823 for NASD and we will spell those out when we get to the numbers. But I don\u2019t think that there is going to be anything fundamentally different on an incremental basis going forward.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the NASD Train B line, Mike, you said it was pushed out a little bit in terms of the launch timeline. Is that like 1 or 2 months? I thought the plan was already mid next year. And could you elaborate a little more specifically on kind of where the supply chain issues exactly what those are that are kind of pushing the delay?\nMike McMullen: I think you got the right timeframe in there, which is a month or two. It\u2019s really been sort of specialized steel that\u2019s required. So, I actually had a chance to see it myself, where you go into a room or you are \u2013 the steel pipe fitters are working and they are getting the area ready. They can\u2019t close things off, because they are missing one valve or something. So we have had bits and pieces that have been missing that actually caused us certain delays. I mean, the team has been all over. I think the global supply chains are pretty well publicized, but we thought it was \u2013 we thought we should in the spirit of transparency let you know we are still on track for revenue coming out of the facility in \u201823, but maybe a month or two later than you thought initially.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And I think, Brandon, there is one more important piece. I think based on what we know today, we still expect to be at capacity at the exit of FY \u201823 as well in terms of the ramp up.\nBrandon Couillard: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Congrats on a really strong quarter here. Hi, Mike. Thank you. Congrats on the print. And one maybe on the guidance here, Q4 at the midpoint is 11% organic. You guys just said 15%. The comps will get easier for Q4. I am curious sequentially, when you think about it, is the change just because of the cadence of how the China deferred revenues were recognized more in 3Q versus Q4? Can you just talk about the sequential assumptions here for the 4Q guidance?\nMike McMullen: Sure, Vijay. And again, we are very, very pleased with the print. So thanks for the feedback. And Bob, we didn\u2019t use it in our script, but I think the word prudent may apply to our Q4 guide as well.\nBob McMahon: That\u2019s right. Yes. I think, Vijay, if you think about kind of the moving pieces within China, what we did was we pulled forward some of the revenue that was deferred into Q3, but we also pulled Q1 revenue into Q4. So, Q4, I would say we didn\u2019t have a material change one way or another. We actually feel very good that we are going to realize that full $50 million to $55 million here in the fiscal year versus having it bleed a little into Q1. And as Mike said, I mean we are not out of the woods, certainly in supply chain challenges and COVID situations. And so we thought at this point in time, a double-digit core growth is very good but also prudent, as Mike said.\nVijay Kumar: I love that word prudent. Maybe one on some of the moving parts for \u201823, Mike and I am not asking for a guidance, but if I look at pricing contribution, I think we started the year at 100 basis points. We are running at 300 basis points. I think that pricing should continue until it annualizes until mid of next year. You did mention orders coming in about revenues. What is the backlog conversion? Is that a 3-month or a 6-month or a 12-month visibility that you have from backlog, any impact from NASD? And sorry, on C&E very strong, but obviously, with the macro, should we perhaps be prudent for \u201823?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So, great question, Vijay. So I think I\u2019d like to \u2013 the headline here was as way Bob closed off his prepared remarks, we are building a strong foundation for the future. So, we have got \u2013 we had record revenues in Q3 yet we still build backlog. And some of that backlog obviously will carry into \u201823. And we \u2013 it\u2019s probably a 3 to 6-month visibility for sure on the revenue coming from the backlog. And Bob, I don\u2019t see that. And we agree with your thesis around pricing and the impact it will have on our \u201823 business as well. And Bob, maybe you want to add to...\nBob McMahon: Yes. The only thing \u2013 I think you are spot on, Vijay. I would say there is not a material change right now in terms of how we are thinking about NASD. And if I think about the various pieces there, they certainly set us up for a good momentum going into FY \u201823. Now there is still some unknowns in terms of kind of the macro environment, but we are expecting to have a stronger than normal backlog. We certainly have that right now and are expecting to continue that into \u201823. And then obviously, pricing is continuing to anniversary and I would expect it to be a higher contributor to growth next year, all things being equal.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thank you, guys.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Vijay.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB. Please proceed.\nPuneet Souda: Hi, Mike and Bob. Thanks for taking the questions. So, first one just LSAG, obviously, a very strong quarter and I mean, obviously, congrats on the quarter here. When you look at the 25% growth that you are seeing in LC overall, the order book being strong, can you maybe just characterize sort of from an end-market perspective, it seems like biopharma continues to do well. But geographically, can you just characterize \u2013 is this contribution from biopharma China in the quarter and how should we think about the sort of order book? Can you maybe characterize the order book more geographically? And do you expect this \u2013 again in line with sort of some of the other questions as sort of how should we think about this order book flow through \u2013 flowing through into 2023?\nBob McMahon: Puneet, you packed in a lot in that one question. But we\u2019ll try to address it. Sorry, Mike.\nMike McMullen: I was just saying, maybe you want to take that, Bob. But I think the answer was really across the board. I mean both \u2013 I mean clearly, biopharma and pharma, our portfolio is doing really, really well there. And as I mentioned to the team the other day, we just got the most recent auto report, which shows market share movements. And as my Danish colleagues like to say, it was green as a Danish forest. Did I get that right, Jacob? So...\nJacob Thaysen: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, Mike.\nMike McMullen: It was across the board, but I think it\u2019s the same story holds geographically well. So it really is a nice global story. But I think it\u2019s more than just pharma. I know you\u2019re getting some good C&E growth, right, for \u2013 in the advanced materials, LC/MS. We posted some really good numbers in food and the environmental market, which also are big users of LC and LC/MS. So I think it was really a broad-based story there, if I remember correctly, Jacob.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Correct, Mike. I think we\u2019ve really seen good performance across the board, as you\u2019re saying, Mike. And we are also seeing that the customers are really interested in our full solutions. I think PFAS is a good example of where we see a lot of interest right now both right now, but also where we see some of the big builds that is coming through in U.S. where PFAS have a prominent exposure. So we expect to continue to see momentum in that space.\nBob McMahon: I think, Puneet, just to build on what Mike and Jacob were saying, I think one of the things you\u2019re really seeing come out in Q3 is just the strength and breadth of our portfolio. And why we haven\u2019t talked about spectroscopy a lot in the past, it continues to be a very important part of our portfolio and solution set. And I think it fits nicely across multiple end markets. And the LC and LC/MS get a lot of headlines, but we\u2019re more than just an LC and LC/MS business.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just \u2013 I\u2019ll keep it simple for my follow-up. Polymer Standards acquisition, can you characterize sort of what\u2019s the contribution this year? And how does that enhance your offering for columns and sort of biomolecules? And should \u2013 how should we think about that overall \u2013 acquisition overall fitting into the LSAG group?\nMike McMullen: You want to take the first piece of that?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Yes, I\u2019ll \u2013 it\u2019s not a material business. We estimate that\u2019s less than $10 million annualized today. That\u2019s the 0.1% that we built into our guide for Q4. But more importantly, I think strategically, I\u2019ll let Jacob talk about the merits of the portfolio and how we think it\u2019s going to continue to drive growth for us.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Thanks for that. And we have a long-standing relationship with PFS, so we knew exactly their strength. And we\u2019ve been very impressed with what they have done in the polymer business for the \u2013 for a long period of time. And particularly, our interest was intrigued when we also see polymer science going from advanced material into biopharma, where we see a lot of opportunities. And PFS have done a wonderful job using our instrumentation together with their columns and also an informatics pack they have built to really go after a segment of the market and also the expertise in the field. They have more than 500 application nodes within this field. So we can really leverage that with the strong presence we have across the globe to really accelerate that business opportunity that has been up over the past decades, really.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Congrats again.\nMike McMullen: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Hi, thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the nice quarter.\nMike McMullen: Hi, Rachel. Thank you.\nRachel Vatnsdal: The first up on China \u2013 thank you, Mike. Yes. Great to hear that some of that catch-up in China was pulled forward there. And then you also pointed to double-digit growth in the region for that ex acceleration recovery. So first off, can you just walk us through specifically what drove that pull-forward on the catch-up from lockdown? And are you seeing an acceleration of demand catch up in China? And then second, how are you thinking about that longer-term growth within China because that we source of upside for the year?\nMike McMullen: Great. So I\u2019ll start, Bob, here. So I\u2019d have to say it was an extraordinary effort of our team in China. I mean people sacrificed and worked tremendously hard. We had people coming into our factories and living at the factories. They slept and worked at the factories for the entire period of when before you couldn\u2019t really get out beyond \u2013 back to your local community. So they did that for several weeks both in our logistics operations as well as our factories. And that allowed us to get our global GC production going as well as the import/export of our products as well. So I have to say it really was extraordinary effort of the team that made that happen. And we\u2019re very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow well in China. In Q2, I think we talked about a greater than 20% order rate. We posted a number of 29% growth in Q3. Yes, we still built backlog in the third quarter in China. So I think we\u2019re well positioned for the fourth quarter. And Bob, I said that probably does represent a level of upside potentially with things continuing to develop as we hope. The wildcards from my perspective are how much money could come into the segment from government stimulus. I know they\u2019re talking about some of the things we haven\u2019t seen any specifics. So that would be something that would be there on a positive. But again, our demand really is coming from the core private sector, commercial sector around pharma and C&E. We think those things are sustainable.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Exactly, Mike. I think you mentioned Q2 kind of order growth rate, and Q3 was in that same range. And so we\u2019re seeing very strong demand and been able to do a fantastic job of ramping up that capacity, and we expect that to continue into Q4.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great to hear. And then last one for me, just on the C&E segment. So 22% growth is quite impressive, and that growth has really continued to accelerate in recent quarters in that end market. So how should we be thinking about that longer-term outlook for C&E, especially given some of the macro dependence on that portfolio?\nMike McMullen: Well, we think that the structure of this marketplace has changed over the last few years. And yes, that\u2019s still a segment that\u2019s tied directly to what happens to the global GDP situation. But we had \u2013 it in my comments, there\u2019s secular demand happening here, particularly in advanced materials when there\u2019s investments being made in battery technology, more sustainable materials, semiconductors, onshoring of production. So we think those trends are here for a number of years. I think our view is the sector has probably got a higher growth rate than we viewed it having a couple of years ago because of the secular aspect of growth in C&E. And Bob, what else might you add there?\nBob McMahon: I think \u2013 as you said, I think one of the things that I think is really important, don\u2019t take \u201822 and take \u2013 build it into your model because we don\u2019t think that, that growth rate is going to continue. We certainly are pleased with it. But I think the other more important piece is we have a very strong right to win in the C&E business. We\u2019re a leader in this space and feel good about our portfolio. And as Mike said, this is an area that we are seeing kind of a renewed sense in some of these areas that we do think that has many years to come in terms of investment.\nMike McMullen: I\u2019m going to use an undisputed leader in the space.\nBob McMahon: I won\u2019t disagree.\nMike McMullen: Thanks for the question, Rachel.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nMike Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. I want to follow-up on your comments on price.\nMike McMullen: Hi, Mike.\nMike Ryskin: Hi, guys. You sort of indicated that price continues to sort of grow as you go through the year. Is that a factor of the timing of when orders are converted to revenues and when you\u2019re recognizing those revenues? So it\u2019s just more of a dynamic of that? Or is this an incremental price increase that you\u2019re building in as you go through the year? And just alongside that, any comments you could take in terms of reception to price? Any pushback or any particular areas where are you able to take more versus last? Just sort of give us an update on the pricing dynamic as you go through the year.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hi, Mike, this is Bob. I\u2019ll take that ear. It\u2019s the former. And so when we take price, it takes some time to get through the backlog. And so we\u2019re seeing the price realization from the orders that \u2013 the price increase that we took back in the beginning of the calendar year. And really, what we\u2019re trying to do is cover our costs. And we\u2019re seeing increased logistics costs and increased material costs. And so we\u2019ve taken it across the board, but also recognizing where the costs are higher, we\u2019ve taken those prices up higher. We haven\u2019t really heard any pushback, I think, as evidenced by our strong order growth. And then also we look very closely at cancellations or \u2013 within our order book, and that continues to be very low. And so I think our customers understand why we\u2019re having to raise prices because of the inflationary environment. And I think to date, we\u2019ve been able to actually generate more price than I think we anticipated at the beginning of the year.\nMike Ryskin: Okay. Great. And then a follow-up. You\u2019ve commented on the balance sheet that you\u2019re getting the leverage lower and lower. I\u2019ve done a couple of deals here and there in the past couple of years with the defended to be on the much smaller side. So could you talk about your willingness to lever up a little bit to put a little bit more of that capital to work? And if so, what are the types of assets you\u2019re looking for? Sort of are sellers willing to engage in this market? Or is the \u2013 how are things proceeding on that front \u2013 on the BD front? Thanks.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I think we\u2019ve been public about being willing to take on bigger deals than what we have had historically. I think we\u2019re still \u2013 we have the benefit of having a very strong balance sheet. We\u2019re going to first invest in our business. We think that that\u2019s the greatest opportunity, but we\u2019re always out on the lookout for M&A. And as you said \u2013 I would say the pipeline continues to be healthy. The dynamic has certainly changed in the last 9 months, particularly on the public market side, and I think there\u2019s some good assets out there. It\u2019s probably taken a little longer on the private market side, which is where we tend to focus our efforts. But I can tell you that we have \u2013 the beauty of our model is that we have organic growth first and M&A as kind of an adder on top of that. And so it is something that we\u2019re continuing to look at and would be not uncomfortable levering up a little higher than where we are today for the right deal and if the economics work.\nMike McMullen: Absolutely, Bob.\nMike Ryskin: Is that 3x to 4x lever or...\nBob McMahon: I\u2019m not \u2013 that\u2019s pretty rich. But I think it all depends on what the right asset and what it looks like.\nMike Ryskin: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please proceed.\nJosh Waldman: Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for you guys. First, Mike, wondered if you could provide more context on the supply chain situation, how supply and cost to track versus your expectations over the last 90 days. Have you seen any relief on supply? And then it sounds like you built backlog in Q3. Curious whether your fourth quarter guide assumes any work-down in the backlog given recent order rates?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So I\u2019ll let Bob handle the second question, and I\u2019ll start with the first one. So supply chain challenges are still out there, but our team continues to do an excellent job navigating them, getting the material that we need for our customers. We continue to have very, very low order cancellation rates is something we watch like a hawk. And I think we\u2019re managing the price changes. So I think in the early days of things, we were kind of surprised at what things would cost on the market for chips and others, but I think we\u2019ve now found ways to work that and then offset that with some of the pricing actions that we mentioned earlier. So I think if anything, it\u2019s probably trending in a more positive direction, albeit is still challenging out there.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And I would say \u2013 on the second question, Josh, I would say, first and foremost, demand continues to be very strong in our marketplace. And so we\u2019re expecting order growth to continue in our fourth quarter. As you know, that typically is one of the larger quarters that we have for our sales organization and certainly for our customers as well. That being said, I would expect maybe some slight degradation in backlog just given, again, the deferral that we\u2019re talking about within China. But don\u2019t interpret that as us seeing anything slowing in the marketplace.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. And then kind of along those lines, wondered if the group has any initial thoughts on pharma budget flushing this year given the strength in orders from these accounts. Curious at this point if you\u2019re getting any indication that maybe the strength in the order book is reflecting pull-forward or just not seeing that yet?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Josh, I\u2019m going to pass this call over to Padraig. He\u2019s the closest to what\u2019s going on. As you know, he heads up our one commercialization addition to running our ACG services business. So Padraig what\u2019s your thoughts on that?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No, I think it\u2019s pretty steady, Mike. We\u2019re not seeing any pull-forward at this point. And of course, the team are very focused on key end-market workflows where we have the best chance to meet the customer needs. So we\u2019re seeing a very steady-state order rate with not much pull-forward.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Appreciate it.\nMike McMullen: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please proceed.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon.\nJack Meehan: I wanted to ask about the chemical and energy \u2013 good afternoon. So the chemical and energy acceleration, my first question is on the chemicals customers. So your commentary sounds pretty bullish. There has certainly been some headlines from some of the big European chemical players that have been a little bit more mixed though. So it would just be great to get your perspective on how you feel about the durability of that customer class and kind of squaring your view versus what we might be hearing from others in the market?\nMike McMullen: Yes. That maybe more regionally specific to Europe, where we did see a level of growth a little bit slower than we\u2019ve seen in the Americas and China. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably more regionally specific. And as we mentioned earlier on the call, Europe remains sort of a watch area for us because of, obviously, obvious challenges in that region right now. But I think we think it\u2019s pretty durable right now. I mean, I think \u2013 remember, the chemical piece is going into some of these supply chains as fabs go up and other things. So it\u2019s fueling some of the efforts in the advanced materials area. Bob, I know that you and Jacob looked at this a little more closely. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d add to that?\nBob McMahon: No. I think you\u2019re spot on, Mike. I mean if we looked across the \u2013 all regions grew in C&E as, Mike, you were saying, but Europe was below the average. And so \u2013 but I think over time, that investment in some of these areas, we think, is ongoing demand.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then it was only a week ago, the CHIPS and Science Act got signed into law. I\u2019m not sure if you have any early perspectives as to what this might mean for Agilent. If you could call out kind of the businesses that you think could benefit from some of the funding that\u2019s going in? And can you just maybe call out what did the advanced materials business grow this quarter? Thanks.\nMike McMullen: Yes. So I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019ll let Bob handle the second question. He\u2019s got more numbers on the pages than I do in front of him. But relative to the recent enactment by Congress, we see some real upside for us. And we actually were just talking about that before this call. I think the big debate is when is it actually going to release. But Jacob mentioned earlier PFAS. There\u2019s \u2013 what we can see there\u2019s some funding in there for PFAS, which will help our LC/MS and GC/MS business and then tied to the chips, both the upstream and downstream side, the semiconductor fabs that play right into spectroscopy strength that that we mentioned as well. And Jacob, perhaps you want to add a few other things.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. I think, I mean, actually, even though spectroscopy and GC are the big winners in the \u2013 related to the CHIPS Act, we actually see across the board. It\u2019s both the mass spec business, also the LC/MS that Mike was mentioning and then, of course, a lot of our consumables also. And so we see a lot of opportunities here. I think both the CHIP Act, but also the other bill, the \u2013 what\u2019s it called, the...\nMike McMullen: Inflation.\nJacob Thaysen: And the Inflation Bill here, all of them are driving some of our technologies. So we see a lot of opportunities in that. Now it all comes down to timing here.\nMike McMullen: Yes.\nBob McMahon: And the answer to your last question, it was above 30%.\nJack Meehan: Thanks. Super. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Elizabeth Garcia with UBS. Please proceed.\nElizabeth Garcia: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats.\nMike McMullen: Sure, Elizabeth. No problem. Thank you very much.\nElizabeth Garcia: Yes. Great. So maybe I just didn\u2019t catch it, but I know there was the planned shutdown this quarter for NASD. But just thinking about kind of how we should think about kind of close this quarter and then maybe sequentially as we head into the next quarter, in 4Q?\nMike McMullen: Bob, you and Sam want to tag team on this one?\nBob McMahon: Yes. So we had a planned shutdown this quarter, expect return to strong growth in Q4 for NASD.\nMike McMullen: And Sam, I don\u2019t know if you want to add some comments about what you\u2019re seeing on the market as well?\nSam Raha: Yes. Yes. Thanks, Mike, and thanks for the question. I mean, listen, it was a good quarter. We had the planned shutdown you already heard about. But I want to note that we are very pleased with the trend that we\u2019re seeing that increasingly these very therapeutic oligos that we\u2019re working on that the treatment modalities beyond the more rare indications are expanding into diseases for larger populations. For example, you might have seen just the recent news from Alnylam that reported favorable results on their Phase 3 study for patisiran. And this is for patients with ATTR for cardiomyopathy. And as Alnylam\u2019s supplier for the API and patisiran, we\u2019re of course, excited. We also think this is indicative of just generally the trend that we\u2019re starting to see in the promise of therapeutic oligos. And our book of business remains strong as we go into the quarter and as we will go into next year.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Sam. I probably should elaborate a little more, Elizabeth, on the routine. I think it\u2019s also important understand why we were shutting down, right? It\u2019s both for routine maintenance but also a critical milestone in the construction of Train B. So we tied the infrastructure together. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re speaking with confidence about our ability to get revenue in \u201823.\nElizabeth Garcia: Great. Great news. And I guess just one more for me thing on the theme of kind of biopharma. So you kind of \u2013 you\u2019ve announced the collaboration with APC for real-time process monitoring. We also had announcement Merck around downstream PAT. It would be great to kind of get your thoughts around the space and kind of the work you\u2019re doing here.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Yes. I\u2019ll make some high-level comments, and then maybe, Jacob, you want to provide some specific as well. So we love this space. And we\u2019ve been putting a lot of our investments over the last several years targeted at the biopharma space. And you see it reflected now in the growth rates and actually how we\u2019re shifting the mix of our pharma business both in the lab but also plays outside the lab. And Jacob, I know you\u2019ve got a lot of interesting things happening there.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Thanks for that, Mike. And we are very interesting in the bioprocessing space, especially from the unlatent perspective, where we truly believe that the \u2013 that instruments will start to move into the manufacturing. Historically, we have had in the small molecule space, the QA/QC sitting in a different lab. And now we see the opportunity to bring adline online LC and LC/MS technologies into the bioprocessing space itself or manufacturing space itself. And hence, we have decided and we have made collaborations with leaders in that space, Merck being one of them, where we\u2019re developing, of course, based on our individual strength new solutions to address that. But we\u2019re looking at the multiple partnerships in this space here, and we\u2019re really bullish around that.\nElizabeth Garcia: Thanks so much.\nMike McMullen: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question.\nMike McMullen: Hi, Patrick. Sure.\nPatrick Donnelly: Mike, maybe one for you \u2013 hey, how are you? Maybe one for you just on China specifically in terms of the linearity of the quarter. Can you just talk about \u2013 I mean it sounds like things clearly picked up as we went, obviously, on the supply side and you guys kind of got back online. Can you talk about the demand environment as well? Obviously, you guys are the only ones who have kind of a full July in the quarter. So just curious what kind of ramp you saw throughout the quarter. And then again, as we work our way through August here, I mean, it certainly seems like the order growth has been encouraging. But maybe just talk about how things trended there throughout the quarter kind of going into this quarter.\nMike McMullen: Great question. Yes, sure. Happy to do so. I think it\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019ll pass my response into two areas: orders and revenue. So I think I would say the order intake throughout the quarter was there. It was linear, smooth, no, no big lumpiness and the fact that what we saw in the second quarter as well. So now as you know, the revenue side has been a different story because the ability to get product in and out of China as well as produced in China was affected by the COVID-19 shutdowns. And that\u2019s where we saw maybe a slower start first few weeks of Q3, but then the team\u2019s efforts really started paying off when we were able to get back into our facilities. So I think the ramp rate of revenue had looked at a little different profile throughout the quarter. And Bob, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d add anything?\nBob McMahon: Yes. No, that\u2019s exactly right. I mean if you think about the months in our quarters, May was very light. As we talked about, we were ramping up, and I think we exited May at like 25% capacity. And then the teams really started kicking in in gear as the COVID restrictions started to ease. And July was very strong as they not only got the production up to full capacity, but then were able to not only satisfy existing demand, but also some of that deferral bring it in.\nMike McMullen: And they were really focused on meeting the expectations of our customers who wanted the product. And as I mentioned earlier in my earlier comments, we had teams working a lot of overtime, working in the factories over the weekend. So really some heroics that got us back on track.\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes. It\u2019s encouraging to hear. And then, Bob, maybe one for you just on the margin side. You talked about pricing a few times on the call. Can you just talk about, I guess, the flow-through to the margin side? You basically said it\u2019s offsetting some of the increase in costs. Maybe just talk about the give and take on that front in terms of pricing increases, the cost increases and how we should think about kind of that algorithm going forward on the margin piece.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I think if you looked at our 150 basis points year-on-year, it was roughly 50 basis points in gross margin and then 100 basis points of leverage on the SG&A OpEx side. And I think if you looked at that, there was some productivity. As I mentioned, price probably would have kept things flat. And then the other 50 basis points were a benefit of some productivity that the OFS team did and then the volume. That\u2019s the thing that really \u2013 I think really helped drive a benefit in gross margin is just the amount of product that was able to be produced through the factories. And so that I think \u2013 think about pricing as covering our costs. And then if those incrementals around better-than-expected revenues drove the margin improvement on the gross margin side. What I would say is we continue to leverage the OpEx side to drive our productivity as a company overall.\nPatrick Donnelly: Helpful. Thank you, guys.\nMike McMullen: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. The last question is from the line of Tim Daley with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nTim Daley: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the time.\nMike McMullen: Sure, Tim.\nTim Daley: Quickly, wanted to touch back on NASD here. So if we\u2019re just thinking about when we\u2019re past the Train B build-out, things have kind of normalized a bit, you\u2019re starting to leverage those investments and upfront costs here, what\u2019s the clean run rate margin profile to think about in that business, I guess, initially when we get past that capacity build-out here?\nMike McMullen: And Tim, that question brought a smile to Bob\u2019s face. I\u2019ll let him answer that.\nBob McMahon: I would say very good. I\u2019ll leave it at that.\nMike McMullen: The company average, right?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Yes.\nTim Daley: Alright. I can work with that. And then a quick one here on capital allocation. So another strong quarter of buybacks. Just thinking about the go-forward outlook, how should we be sizing this in our heads? The $1 billion, you\u2019ve already hit in \u201822 with a quarter left to go. Is that a good base for the out-years? Just kind of \u2013 just general thoughts on the capital allocation hierarchy as some assets are probably getting a bit cheaper and more attractive here.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I mean, I think our methodology really hasn\u2019t changed. I think what we do is invest for growth first internally, and then we look for value-accreting M&A. But if there isn\u2019t anything imminent, we\u2019re also not going to keep cash on the books. And if I looked at historically, we\u2019ve generated roughly 2% of earnings per share growth kind of below the line through share repurchase. And I think that that\u2019s probably a fair way to look at it going forward. But in terms of \u2013 to be very clear, our priorities are investing for growth internally and then M&A before we would do share repurchases. And we\u2019re also committed to continuing to grow our dividend as well.\nTim Daley: Alright. Great. That\u2019s it from my end. Thank you.\nBob McMahon: You quite welcome.\nOperator: There are no additional questions waiting at this time, so I will turn the call back over to Parmeet for closing remarks.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Hannah, and thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of the day.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation.

            "content": "Yes. I think, as we know, we continue to do really well in the LC/MS space, but this quarter is really a spectroscopy that was standing out. We have \u2013 especially in our atomic spectroscopy field we have really seen a lot of momentum based, of course, on the dynamics in the markets, but also the innovation that has been created over the past years. And I think we really see the impact of that these days. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, Mike. Yes. Correct, Mike. I think we\u2019ve really seen good performance across the board, as you\u2019re saying, Mike. And we are also seeing that the customers are really interested in our full solutions. I think PFAS is a good example of where we see a lot of interest right now both right now, but also where we see some of the big builds that is coming through in U.S. where PFAS have a prominent exposure. So we expect to continue to see momentum in that space. Yes. Thanks for that. And we have a long-standing relationship with PFS, so we knew exactly their strength. And we\u2019ve been very impressed with what they have done in the polymer business for the \u2013 for a long period of time. And particularly, our interest was intrigued when we also see polymer science going from advanced material into biopharma, where we see a lot of opportunities. And PFS have done a wonderful job using our instrumentation together with their columns and also an informatics pack they have built to really go after a segment of the market and also the expertise in the field. They have more than 500 application nodes within this field. So we can really leverage that with the strong presence we have across the globe to really accelerate that business opportunity that has been up over the past decades, really. Yes. I think, I mean, actually, even though spectroscopy and GC are the big winners in the \u2013 related to the CHIPS Act, we actually see across the board.

            "content": "Thanks, Parmeet and thanks everyone for joining our call today. In the third quarter, we once again demonstrated the strength of our diversified business and the unstoppable One Agilent team. We delivered an excellent quarter, significantly exceeding our revenue and earnings expectations. Revenues of $1.72 billion are up 13% core. This is on top of 21% core growth in Q3 of 2021. Third quarter operating margin of 27.5%. Operating margins continue to expand and are up 150 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.34, up 22%. Our strong results in Q3, coupled with orders continuing to outpace revenues, highlight the ongoing strength of our diversified business. The momentum in our business continues, and we once again raised our outlook for the year. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our Q3 results. From an end-market perspective, our results were once again led by strength in our two largest markets, pharma and chemical energy. Our largest market, pharma, grew 16% versus 27% a year ago. Within pharma, both the biopharma and small molecule segments grew double-digits. The momentum in our C&E market segment continues with Q3 growth of 22%. This is on top of 23% growth a year ago. The C&E market is being fueled by demand in chemicals, along with strong secular demand and ongoing investment within the advanced materials space. We are also very pleased to achieve double-digit growth in the food and environmental and forensic markets with both markets growing 11%. In our last call, I shared our belief that the business impact of the Shanghai COVID-19 lockdown would be transitory. I also expressed that we remain confident about the ongoing strength of our business in China. In Q3, the China delivered 29% growth. These stellar results were driven by continued strong end-market demand, coupled with the faster-than-expected recovery of production and shipment activity following the end of the Shanghai area lockdown. We are also very pleased with its results, which highlights the customer focus, drive and outstanding execution of the Agilent China team. Strength in Americas continued as we posted another quarter of double-digit growth on top of 32% growth last year. Our European business grew 6% against 23% last year despite a 2 point headwind for the curtailment of our operations in Russia. In terms of business unit performance, the Life Science and Applied [Technical Difficulty] revenues of $1.02 billion, up 18% on a core basis. Growth was broad-based but continued strong demand for our LC and LC/MS offerings, where we posted high 20s growth. Our spectroscopy business grew low 30s driven by strength in the advanced materials market. Chemistries and consumables, cell analysis and our GC business each delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. LSAG\u2019s end-market growth is broad-based with particular strength in the pharma and chemical and energy markets. Our pharma results were driven by strength in the biopharma segment, which grew more than 20%. We had an excellent showing at the recent ASMS conference, introducing several important LC/MS and GC/MS instruments and biopharma workflow solutions. These innovative and intelligent LC/MS and GC/MS systems have been designed to make the lives of our customers easier. To build an instrument intelligence and a higher level instrument diagnostics helped maximize system uptime and improve lab productivity by allowing operators to focus on their analysis rather than their instruments. In addition, we introduced an industry-first hydro in net source for GC single-quad and GC Triple-Quad instruments, enabling customers to seamlessly migrate from helium as a supplier gas to lower-cost hydrogen. And rounding out the list of new products announced at ASMS, we introduced the mass Hunter BioConfirm 12.0 software, an integrated compliant workflow, targeted at the fast growing oligo-based therapy development market. These new products have already been well received by customers and represent the latest addition to Agilent history of leadership in mass spectrometry. Our LSAG business also won some important awards during the quarter, including the 6560c i-Mobility LCT system, winning the Scientist Choice Award for Best New Spectroscopy product. Earlier this month, we also strengthened and broadened our advanced materials and biopharma portfolio with the acquisition of PSS, Polymer Standard Service, a leader in polymer characterization. We are extremely pleased to welcome the PSS team and their technology to the Agilent family. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenue of $359 million. This is up 10% core. We grew 10% core even as lab activity continues to ramp in China. Growth in services was again broad-based across services contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. Strong instrument placements and increased connect rates continue to be a driver for our service business as customers continue to see value in our ACG offerings. Another critical important factor on our results is the scale and execution capability of Agilent\u2019s world-class global service delivery organization in service of customers to meet their needs. Agilent was seen as the trusted company to work with among our global customers. The Diagnostic and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $340 million, up 3% core. This is diverse compare a 37% growth last year. The solid results in our clinical cancer testing and NGS businesses were partially offset by COVID testing headwinds in a Q PCR portfolio. In addition, the DGG business in China continues to ramp from the COVID-related shutdowns there. NASD revenues were up modestly in line with expectations. As we noted last quarter, Q3 included the impact of a planned shutdown, our oligo manufacturing line in Frederick, Colorado. The shutdown of Frederick was for both routine maintenance and development of key elements of our Train B. Our new manufacturing line have increased our capacity $150 million plus when fully ramped. While we continue to make good progress in the construction of Train B, we have seen some supply chain-related delays and are now targeted a midyear 2023 go-live, a slight delay. We see continued strong demand for oligo-based therapies as the number of approved drugs continues to increase and the pipeline of drugs in development are targeting disease states with larger patient populations. We are more confident than ever in the long-term trajectory of the market and our business. In addition to these highlights, I\u2019d like to also point the recent release of Agilent\u2019s 2021 ESG report. While we\u2019ve always published our progress in sustainability and addressing societal needs, this year, we\u2019ve taken our approach to the next level. We address these issues a new format that for the first time that looks specifically at our progress in the areas of environmental, social and governance issues. We hope you have a chance to review our progress in ESG by checking out the report on the Agilent website, learning more about how we\u2019re executing our mission to advance the quality of life. Agilent\u2019s Q3 results again point to the strength of our diversified business and the outstanding execution ability of the Agilent team. We continue to bring innovative, differentiated new offerings in the marketplace. Acceleration in digital orders growth continues as well as new customer acquisition. In addition, as we started 2022, we undertook a bold move to create One Agilent commercial organization to further drive customer focus and growth. The strength in our portfolio and the continued strong execution by our One Agilent commercial organization make a powerful combination, and you see it in the results we\u2019re delivering. Customer satisfaction hit another all-time high this quarter. We continue to outgrow the market. As a result of our strong Q3 performance and continued momentum, we\u2019re once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Bob will share more of the specifics. It\u2019s an exciting time at Agilent with the best yet to come. Thank you for being on the call today. And now I will hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Good afternoon, Matt. Yes. So I will take the first part of that and we will jump in and have Bob and Jacob add their thoughts here as well. So, I think relative to the strength and why the operating margin was so high is one is, I think we have been \u2013 we rightly benefited from the leverage impact of having those higher-than-expected revenues. But more importantly, we have been working on the pricing side and really ensuring that we are receiving the value for our offerings. And Bob, I think we are well over 3 points of price appreciation overall for the portfolio in LSAG, I believe. And we are \u2013 as you may have picked up in my script, it was across the board a great quarter for LSAG and across all product categories. But Jacob, I think a couple really stood out for you, didn\u2019t they? Yes. I think it was a real race to see who had the highest growth, right, spectroscopy or LC/MS. They both did extremely well. Yes, yes, yes. Yes. Sure, Matt. So we posted a 6% growth rate \u2013 core growth in the third quarter, albeit there was actually 2 points of headwind for the containment of our Russian operations. So really it was high single-digit, 8%, on a restated basis. And Europe clearly is a watch area for us, but we haven\u2019t seen any significant signals of movement to the downside. Brandon, we are probably not ready to talk about \u201823, but what I\u2019ll leave you with is a couple of thoughts here, which is very clearly the business has momentum and/or even though we had the highest revenue quarter ever for Agilent in this recent third quarter, we still build backlog both globally and also in China. So, our orders that exceeded our revenues in those. So, it sets us up nicely, I think for \u201823, but we\u2019ll get to \u201823 guide when we get there. I think you got the right timeframe in there, which is a month or two. It\u2019s really been sort of specialized steel that\u2019s required. So, I actually had a chance to see it myself, where you go into a room or you are \u2013 the steel pipe fitters are working and they are getting the area ready. They can\u2019t close things off, because they are missing one valve or something. So we have had bits and pieces that have been missing that actually caused us certain delays. I mean, the team has been all over. I think the global supply chains are pretty well publicized, but we thought it was \u2013 we thought we should in the spirit of transparency let you know we are still on track for revenue coming out of the facility in \u201823, but maybe a month or two later than you thought initially. Sure, Vijay. And again, we are very, very pleased with the print. So thanks for the feedback. And Bob, we didn\u2019t use it in our script, but I think the word prudent may apply to our Q4 guide as well. Yes. So, great question, Vijay. So I think I\u2019d like to \u2013 the headline here was as way Bob closed off his prepared remarks, we are building a strong foundation for the future. So, we have got \u2013 we had record revenues in Q3 yet we still build backlog. And some of that backlog obviously will carry into \u201823. And we \u2013 it\u2019s probably a 3 to 6-month visibility for sure on the revenue coming from the backlog. And Bob, I don\u2019t see that. And we agree with your thesis around pricing and the impact it will have on our \u201823 business as well. And Bob, maybe you want to add to... Thanks, Vijay. I was just saying, maybe you want to take that, Bob. But I think the answer was really across the board. I mean both \u2013 I mean clearly, biopharma and pharma, our portfolio is doing really, really well there. And as I mentioned to the team the other day, we just got the most recent auto report, which shows market share movements. And as my Danish colleagues like to say, it was green as a Danish forest. Did I get that right, Jacob? So... It was across the board, but I think it\u2019s the same story holds geographically well. So it really is a nice global story. But I think it\u2019s more than just pharma. I know you\u2019re getting some good C&E growth, right, for \u2013 in the advanced materials, LC/MS. We posted some really good numbers in food and the environmental market, which also are big users of LC and LC/MS. So I think it was really a broad-based story there, if I remember correctly, Jacob. You want to take the first piece of that? Thank you. Appreciate it. Hi, Rachel. Thank you. Great. So I\u2019ll start, Bob, here. So I\u2019d have to say it was an extraordinary effort of our team in China. I mean people sacrificed and worked tremendously hard. We had people coming into our factories and living at the factories. They slept and worked at the factories for the entire period of when before you couldn\u2019t really get out beyond \u2013 back to your local community. So they did that for several weeks both in our logistics operations as well as our factories. And that allowed us to get our global GC production going as well as the import/export of our products as well. So I have to say it really was extraordinary effort of the team that made that happen. And we\u2019re very optimistic about our ability to continue to grow well in China. In Q2, I think we talked about a greater than 20% order rate. We posted a number of 29% growth in Q3. Yes, we still built backlog in the third quarter in China. So I think we\u2019re well positioned for the fourth quarter. And Bob, I said that probably does represent a level of upside potentially with things continuing to develop as we hope. The wildcards from my perspective are how much money could come into the segment from government stimulus. I know they\u2019re talking about some of the things we haven\u2019t seen any specifics. So that would be something that would be there on a positive. But again, our demand really is coming from the core private sector, commercial sector around pharma and C&E. We think those things are sustainable. Well, we think that the structure of this marketplace has changed over the last few years. And yes, that\u2019s still a segment that\u2019s tied directly to what happens to the global GDP situation. But we had \u2013 it in my comments, there\u2019s secular demand happening here, particularly in advanced materials when there\u2019s investments being made in battery technology, more sustainable materials, semiconductors, onshoring of production. So we think those trends are here for a number of years. I think our view is the sector has probably got a higher growth rate than we viewed it having a couple of years ago because of the secular aspect of growth in C&E. And Bob, what else might you add there? I\u2019m going to use an undisputed leader in the space. Thanks for the question, Rachel. Hi, Mike. Absolutely, Bob. Yes. So I\u2019ll let Bob handle the second question, and I\u2019ll start with the first one. So supply chain challenges are still out there, but our team continues to do an excellent job navigating them, getting the material that we need for our customers. We continue to have very, very low order cancellation rates is something we watch like a hawk. And I think we\u2019re managing the price changes. So I think in the early days of things, we were kind of surprised at what things would cost on the market for chips and others, but I think we\u2019ve now found ways to work that and then offset that with some of the pricing actions that we mentioned earlier. So I think if anything, it\u2019s probably trending in a more positive direction, albeit is still challenging out there. Yes. Josh, I\u2019m going to pass this call over to Padraig. He\u2019s the closest to what\u2019s going on. As you know, he heads up our one commercialization addition to running our ACG services business. So Padraig what\u2019s your thoughts on that? Welcome. Good afternoon. Yes. That maybe more regionally specific to Europe, where we did see a level of growth a little bit slower than we\u2019ve seen in the Americas and China. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s probably more regionally specific. And as we mentioned earlier on the call, Europe remains sort of a watch area for us because of, obviously, obvious challenges in that region right now. But I think we think it\u2019s pretty durable right now. I mean, I think \u2013 remember, the chemical piece is going into some of these supply chains as fabs go up and other things. So it\u2019s fueling some of the efforts in the advanced materials area. Bob, I know that you and Jacob looked at this a little more closely. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d add to that? Yes. So I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019ll let Bob handle the second question. He\u2019s got more numbers on the pages than I do in front of him. But relative to the recent enactment by Congress, we see some real upside for us. And we actually were just talking about that before this call. I think the big debate is when is it actually going to release. But Jacob mentioned earlier PFAS. There\u2019s \u2013 what we can see there\u2019s some funding in there for PFAS, which will help our LC/MS and GC/MS business and then tied to the chips, both the upstream and downstream side, the semiconductor fabs that play right into spectroscopy strength that that we mentioned as well. And Jacob, perhaps you want to add a few other things. Inflation. Yes. Sure, Elizabeth. No problem. Thank you very much. Bob, you and Sam want to tag team on this one? And Sam, I don\u2019t know if you want to add some comments about what you\u2019re seeing on the market as well? Thanks, Sam. I probably should elaborate a little more, Elizabeth, on the routine. I think it\u2019s also important understand why we were shutting down, right? It\u2019s both for routine maintenance but also a critical milestone in the construction of Train B. So we tied the infrastructure together. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re speaking with confidence about our ability to get revenue in \u201823. Yes. Yes. I\u2019ll make some high-level comments, and then maybe, Jacob, you want to provide some specific as well. So we love this space. And we\u2019ve been putting a lot of our investments over the last several years targeted at the biopharma space. And you see it reflected now in the growth rates and actually how we\u2019re shifting the mix of our pharma business both in the lab but also plays outside the lab. And Jacob, I know you\u2019ve got a lot of interesting things happening there. Welcome. Hi, Patrick. Sure. Great question. Yes, sure. Happy to do so. I think it\u2019s a great question. And I\u2019ll pass my response into two areas: orders and revenue. So I think I would say the order intake throughout the quarter was there. It was linear, smooth, no, no big lumpiness and the fact that what we saw in the second quarter as well. So now as you know, the revenue side has been a different story because the ability to get product in and out of China as well as produced in China was affected by the COVID-19 shutdowns. And that\u2019s where we saw maybe a slower start first few weeks of Q3, but then the team\u2019s efforts really started paying off when we were able to get back into our facilities. So I think the ramp rate of revenue had looked at a little different profile throughout the quarter. And Bob, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d add anything? And they were really focused on meeting the expectations of our customers who wanted the product. And as I mentioned earlier in my earlier comments, we had teams working a lot of overtime, working in the factories over the weekend. So really some heroics that got us back on track. Welcome. Sure, Tim. And Tim, that question brought a smile to Bob\u2019s face. I\u2019ll let him answer that. The company average, right?"

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks Mike and good afternoon everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I will then finish up with our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are extremely pleased with our Q3 performance. Results were above expectations, and we expect that strength to continue in the fourth quarter. Q3 revenues were $1.72 billion, up 8.4% on a reported basis and up 13.2% core. FX was a 4 point headwind to growth or $76 million. Pricing for the quarter contributed over 3 points of growth year-on-year and improved sequentially. The performance was broad-based as all end markets and regions grew during the quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, the COVID-related lockdowns in China deferred an estimated $50 million to $55 million in revenue from Q2, and we forecasted that revenue would be recovered during the rest of the calendar year. Our team in China did a fantastic job ramping production and shipments faster than expected following the shutdowns. We estimate over half of that deferred total was delivered in Q3, exceeding our expectations. Given the strong performance, we now expect the remainder will be delivered in Q4, which is an acceleration from our thinking from last quarter. The acceleration of the COVID-related shutdown recovery in China contributed to an already strong Q3 for the company. For perspective, we estimate the total business grew double digits, excluding the accelerated recovery. As Mike mentioned, earnings per share of $1.34 were up 22% from a year ago, representing strong incremental flow-through of the better-than-expected revenue growth. This performance is against our most difficult comparison of the year as EPS grew 41% in Q3 of last year. Now let me dive a little deeper into the end markets. Our largest market, pharma, was up 16%, exceeding our expectations. Biopharma grew 18% and small molecule was up 14%. Biopharma is a focus area for us and now represents 38% of our overall pharma business. We expect that ratio to continue to climb over time. In addition, all 3 business groups grew double digits in the pharma segment. And our LC portfolio continues to perform very well, growing 25% in this important market for us. Chemical and energy continued to show strength, growing 22% during the quarter, driven by the chemicals and advanced materials segment of this market. We saw strength in plastics and packaging for chemicals and ongoing demand in advanced materials coming from the markets for semiconductors and batteries. In the food segment, we achieved growth of 11% on top of 12% growth a year ago. Strength in the food market was led by the Americas and China. Our environmental and forensics market also grew 11% during the quarter, driven by the Americas and China. In the Americas, we saw increased funding to support PFAS testing, while China experienced faster-than-expected recovery post the Shanghai shutdowns for GC and GC/MS. The academia and government market grew 5% on top of a 12% comparison last year, in line with expectations. And rounding out the review of our end markets, our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 2% against a very strong 28% compare versus last year. While not material at the Agilent level, this market did experience some headwinds associated with COVID-related revenues being lower than last year. Excluding this, the growth would have been mid-single digits in this quarter. On a geographic basis, China led the way with 29% growth driven by underlying demand and a faster-than-expected recovery following the COVID-related lockdowns. And looking forward, demand in China continues to be very strong. The Americas grew 11%, another strong showing, and Europe grew 6%, which exceeded expectations. Now turning to the rest of the P&L. Our team continues to execute at a very high level. Third quarter gross margin was 56.4%, up 50 basis points from a year ago as pricing actions, volume and productivity helped to offset inflationary pressures tied to ongoing supply chain challenges and higher logistics costs. Operating expense leverage, driven by the strong top line and continued attention to cost management, helped to deliver very healthy margin improvements. Our operating margin was 27.5%, up 150 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 14% for the quarter as expected, and we had 299 million diluted shares outstanding. Looking at cash flow and our balance sheet. We generated operating cash flow of $326 million in the quarter while investing $82 million in capital expenditures during Q3, driven by our NASD expansion. During the quarter, we also repurchased $323 million worth of shares. We paid out $62 million in dividends in Q3, returning a combined total of $385 million to shareholders in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have purchased over $1 billion of shares. Given the ongoing strength of the business, we believe this is a very good investment. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy with a net leverage ratio of 1. Now let\u2019s move to our outlook for the full year and the fourth quarter. We now expect revenues for the full year to be in the range of $6.75 billion to $6.775 billion. This takes into account our Q3 results and an improved outlook in Q4, partially offset by an additional $40 million headwind associated with the strengthening of the dollar. This represents core revenue growth of between 9.9% and 10.3%. We are also raising our EPS guidance for the year to a range of $5.06 to $5.08, representing 17% growth year-on-year. This translates to Q4 revenue in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.775 billion. Core growth is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 11.8%, while exchange rates will be a 5-point headwind, and M&A will contribute 0.1 points. In closing out our Q4 guidance, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.38 to $1.40, up 14% to 16% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14% tax rate and 299 million diluted shares outstanding. The Agilent team once again performed extremely well in Q3, delivering strong results, driving excellent execution and building a strong foundation for the future. Our diversified business and most importantly, our team have put us in an excellent position to again deliver strong results in Q4. And now back to Parmeet, as we take your questions. Parmeet? That\u2019s correct. That\u2019s correct. Yes. I think, Matt, to build on what Mike is saying, I think in particular we continue to see very strong growth in our pharma business and that really is a global phenomenon. And \u2013 but we also saw very nice growth in our chemical and energy businesses as well. And so as Mike mentioned, it is a watch area, but the demand \u2013 from what we are seeing in the health of the order funnel continues to be there. Yes. And I think, Brandon, on your core incrementals, I mean, I think that if you look at historically, that\u2019s where we have been. Obviously, we do have some startup costs in \u201823 for NASD and we will spell those out when we get to the numbers. But I don\u2019t think that there is going to be anything fundamentally different on an incremental basis going forward. Yes. And I think, Brandon, there is one more important piece. I think based on what we know today, we still expect to be at capacity at the exit of FY \u201823 as well in terms of the ramp up. That\u2019s right. Yes. I think, Vijay, if you think about kind of the moving pieces within China, what we did was we pulled forward some of the revenue that was deferred into Q3, but we also pulled Q1 revenue into Q4. So, Q4, I would say we didn\u2019t have a material change one way or another. We actually feel very good that we are going to realize that full $50 million to $55 million here in the fiscal year versus having it bleed a little into Q1. And as Mike said, I mean we are not out of the woods, certainly in supply chain challenges and COVID situations. And so we thought at this point in time, a double-digit core growth is very good but also prudent, as Mike said. Yes. The only thing \u2013 I think you are spot on, Vijay. I would say there is not a material change right now in terms of how we are thinking about NASD. And if I think about the various pieces there, they certainly set us up for a good momentum going into FY \u201823. Now there is still some unknowns in terms of kind of the macro environment, but we are expecting to have a stronger than normal backlog. We certainly have that right now and are expecting to continue that into \u201823. And then obviously, pricing is continuing to anniversary and I would expect it to be a higher contributor to growth next year, all things being equal. Puneet, you packed in a lot in that one question. But we\u2019ll try to address it. Sorry, Mike. I think, Puneet, just to build on what Mike and Jacob were saying, I think one of the things you\u2019re really seeing come out in Q3 is just the strength and breadth of our portfolio. And why we haven\u2019t talked about spectroscopy a lot in the past, it continues to be a very important part of our portfolio and solution set. And I think it fits nicely across multiple end markets. And the LC and LC/MS get a lot of headlines, but we\u2019re more than just an LC and LC/MS business. Yes. Yes, I\u2019ll \u2013 it\u2019s not a material business. We estimate that\u2019s less than $10 million annualized today. That\u2019s the 0.1% that we built into our guide for Q4. But more importantly, I think strategically, I\u2019ll let Jacob talk about the merits of the portfolio and how we think it\u2019s going to continue to drive growth for us. Yes. Exactly, Mike. I think you mentioned Q2 kind of order growth rate, and Q3 was in that same range. And so we\u2019re seeing very strong demand and been able to do a fantastic job of ramping up that capacity, and we expect that to continue into Q4. I think \u2013 as you said, I think one of the things that I think is really important, don\u2019t take \u201822 and take \u2013 build it into your model because we don\u2019t think that, that growth rate is going to continue. We certainly are pleased with it. But I think the other more important piece is we have a very strong right to win in the C&E business. We\u2019re a leader in this space and feel good about our portfolio. And as Mike said, this is an area that we are seeing kind of a renewed sense in some of these areas that we do think that has many years to come in terms of investment. I won\u2019t disagree. Yes. Hi, Mike, this is Bob. I\u2019ll take that ear. It\u2019s the former. And so when we take price, it takes some time to get through the backlog. And so we\u2019re seeing the price realization from the orders that \u2013 the price increase that we took back in the beginning of the calendar year. And really, what we\u2019re trying to do is cover our costs. And we\u2019re seeing increased logistics costs and increased material costs. And so we\u2019ve taken it across the board, but also recognizing where the costs are higher, we\u2019ve taken those prices up higher. We haven\u2019t really heard any pushback, I think, as evidenced by our strong order growth. And then also we look very closely at cancellations or \u2013 within our order book, and that continues to be very low. And so I think our customers understand why we\u2019re having to raise prices because of the inflationary environment. And I think to date, we\u2019ve been able to actually generate more price than I think we anticipated at the beginning of the year. Yes. I think we\u2019ve been public about being willing to take on bigger deals than what we have had historically. I think we\u2019re still \u2013 we have the benefit of having a very strong balance sheet. We\u2019re going to first invest in our business. We think that that\u2019s the greatest opportunity, but we\u2019re always out on the lookout for M&A. And as you said \u2013 I would say the pipeline continues to be healthy. The dynamic has certainly changed in the last 9 months, particularly on the public market side, and I think there\u2019s some good assets out there. It\u2019s probably taken a little longer on the private market side, which is where we tend to focus our efforts. But I can tell you that we have \u2013 the beauty of our model is that we have organic growth first and M&A as kind of an adder on top of that. And so it is something that we\u2019re continuing to look at and would be not uncomfortable levering up a little higher than where we are today for the right deal and if the economics work. I\u2019m not \u2013 that\u2019s pretty rich. But I think it all depends on what the right asset and what it looks like. Yes. And I would say \u2013 on the second question, Josh, I would say, first and foremost, demand continues to be very strong in our marketplace. And so we\u2019re expecting order growth to continue in our fourth quarter. As you know, that typically is one of the larger quarters that we have for our sales organization and certainly for our customers as well. That being said, I would expect maybe some slight degradation in backlog just given, again, the deferral that we\u2019re talking about within China. But don\u2019t interpret that as us seeing anything slowing in the marketplace. No. I think you\u2019re spot on, Mike. I mean if we looked across the \u2013 all regions grew in C&E as, Mike, you were saying, but Europe was below the average. And so \u2013 but I think over time, that investment in some of these areas, we think, is ongoing demand. And the answer to your last question, it was above 30%. Yes. So we had a planned shutdown this quarter, expect return to strong growth in Q4 for NASD. Yes. No, that\u2019s exactly right. I mean if you think about the months in our quarters, May was very light. As we talked about, we were ramping up, and I think we exited May at like 25% capacity. And then the teams really started kicking in in gear as the COVID restrictions started to ease. And July was very strong as they not only got the production up to full capacity, but then were able to not only satisfy existing demand, but also some of that deferral bring it in. Yes. I think if you looked at our 150 basis points year-on-year, it was roughly 50 basis points in gross margin and then 100 basis points of leverage on the SG&A OpEx side. And I think if you looked at that, there was some productivity. As I mentioned, price probably would have kept things flat. And then the other 50 basis points were a benefit of some productivity that the OFS team did and then the volume. That\u2019s the thing that really \u2013 I think really helped drive a benefit in gross margin is just the amount of product that was able to be produced through the factories. And so that I think \u2013 think about pricing as covering our costs. And then if those incrementals around better-than-expected revenues drove the margin improvement on the gross margin side. What I would say is we continue to leverage the OpEx side to drive our productivity as a company overall. I would say very good. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Yes. Yes. Yes. I mean, I think our methodology really hasn\u2019t changed. I think what we do is invest for growth first internally, and then we look for value-accreting M&A. But if there isn\u2019t anything imminent, we\u2019re also not going to keep cash on the books. And if I looked at historically, we\u2019ve generated roughly 2% of earnings per share growth kind of below the line through share repurchase. And I think that that\u2019s probably a fair way to look at it going forward. But in terms of \u2013 to be very clear, our priorities are investing for growth internally and then M&A before we would do share repurchases. And we\u2019re also committed to continuing to grow our dividend as well. You quite welcome."

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Parmeet Ahuja, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, Selena, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Mike and Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of the Agilent Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our second quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on exchange rates as of April 30th. As previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes. These changes have no impact on our Company's consolidated financial statements. We will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike McMullen: Thanks Parmeet, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. In Q2, the Agilent team again demonstrated the resilience and strength of our business model. We delivered core revenue growth in line with our forecast, expanded operating margins, and exceeded our EPS expectations. We did this while navigating a dynamic macro environment, including the conflict in Ukraine and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Our Q2 revenues are $1.61 billion. This is up 7% core and is on top of growing 19% in Q2 a year ago. Order performance was even stronger growing double digits on a core basis. Second quarter operating margins at 25.3% continued to expand, up 140 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.13 are up 16%. We achieved these results despite the COVID-related lockdowns that closed our operations in Shanghai, starting in late March and continuing through the entire month of April. We estimate that this is roughly a 350-basis point headwind to our core revenue growth for the quarter. As Bob will indicate when he takes you through the details, this business is not lost and is expected to be recovered through the rest of the calendar year. Most importantly, our team in China is safe, and we restarted limited operations in May at our GC factory and logistics center in Shanghai. From an end-market perspective, the pharma and chemical and energy markets again led the way for us. Our pharma business, Agilent\u2019s largest market, grew 13%, led by biopharma growing high 20s. This represents our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the pharma market. It also builds on top of a stellar 29% growth rate last year. The momentum in our chemical and energy business also continued this quarter, delivering 9% growth in line with expectations and overcoming the shutdown of our primary GC production facility in Shanghai and the conflict in Ukraine. Growth was driven by advanced materials and chemicals. On a geographic basis, the Americas again led the way with 13% growth built on top of 27% growth a year ago. Europe also performed well with growth coming in at 7% following 16% growth last year. China revenues were on track with our expectations through March, but we exited the quarter down 3% given the COVID-related lockdowns. While revenues were affected by the temporary shutdowns in the quarter, overall demand in China remains very robust. In fact, China was the fastest growing region in Q2 from an order perspective, up about 20%. We remain very confident about the ongoing strength of our business in China. Looking at performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $896 million, an increase of 4% on a core basis. Given our manufacturing footprint and relative strength in China, LSAG was disproportionately impacted by the COVID-related shutdowns there. To provide some additional perspective, all major product lines, excluding GC related products, grew solidly in the quarter, led by strong performance in our cell analysis business growing in the mid-teens. Orders for LC and LC/MS continued to be strong. Orders grew mid-20\u2019s globally with particularly high adoption of our two new Bio-LC products. On the LC/MS front, we look forward to announcing several exciting new offerings at the upcoming ASMS conference that will expand our portfolio. Our value proposition continues to resonate with our customers and LSAG exited the quarter with record backlog. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenues of $353 million. This is up 10% core. Growth in services was again broad-based across services contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education, and informatic enterprise services. The scale of our ACG business and breadth of portfolio continued to drive growth and margin expansion even in the face of inflationary pressures. Q2 marked the sixth straight quarter we\u2019ve delivered growth across all markets and regions. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $358 million, up 15% core versus 16% last year. Our excellent growth was led by NASD and genomics. The NASD team delivered yet another strong quarter, generating record revenue and profitability. During the quarter, I had a chance to visit our team in Colorado and see first-hand the excellent progress that\u2019s being made meeting current customer needs and also the work underway in continuing to build for future growth with our Train B expansion. We remain extremely bullish about NASD\u2019s future and with Train B coming online in 2023, we\u2019re adding yet another $150 million plus in capacity. Looking across the company, our One Agilent approach and focus on our customers has never been stronger. During the quarter, we were ranked number one in our industry and number two overall in customer satisfaction in The Management 250 ranking, developed by the Drucker Institute. In addition, the new Agilent Commercial organization is already resonating well and delivering successfully for our customers. Agilent\u2019s Q2 results are yet another proof point for how we build a resilient company that can quickly adjust to a changing environment and still post strong results. Given our results to date, along with our backlog and continued order strength, we are again raising our full year core revenue growth and EPS guidance. For the year, we are now expecting 8% to 9% core revenue growth and EPS of $4.86 to $4.93. Bob will provide more detail on our Q3 outlook along with more information on what we expect for the rest of the year. After Bob\u2019s comments and before we take your questions, I will be rejoining the call for some concluding remarks. Thank you for being on the call today, and now I will hand the call off to Bob. Bob?\nBob McMahon: Thanks Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our guidance for the third quarter and the fiscal year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike described, we posted solid topline results in Q2 while overcoming some difficult macro challenges in the business environment. Revenue was $1.61 billion, up a reported 5.4%. In the current quarter, currency was a headwind of 2.1 points while M&A added 20 basis points of growth. Core growth was up 7.3%, in line with expectations despite the COVID-related lockdowns in China, which primarily affected us in April. We estimate the lockdowns deferred $50 million to $55 million of revenue into future quarters, impacting growth in Q2 by roughly 350 basis points. In addition, COVID testing-related revenues were roughly a one-point headwind in the quarter. Our largest market, pharma, grew 13% during the quarter, on top of 29% growth last year. Biopharma continued to be the main driver of results, growing 27% year-on-year, led by NASD. Investments in R&D programs and demand for instrumentation, consumables and critical components remained strong. Pharma represented 37% of our overall revenues this quarter. To put that in perspective, in Q2 2019, effectively one year before the pandemic started, pharma represented just 30% of our business. This not only highlights the strength and resilience of this market, but it also demonstrates how our innovation and investments in higher growth markets continues to pay off. Chemical and energy continued its strong trend of positive results, growing 9% during the quarter despite the impact of the COVID-related lockdowns in China and the conflict in Ukraine. Results were led by strong double-digit growth in advanced materials and specialty chemicals. We expect strong demand to continue in these areas, particularly in semiconductors and battery and clean energy technologies as industry-wide capacity expands. Diagnostics and clinical grew 5% on top of 13% growth last year as year-on-year declines in COVID-related revenues and the temporary shutdowns in China muted our results. The academia and government market was a nice surprise for us, growing 5% in Q2 on top of 21% growth last year. We saw an increase in spending in this market as more university labs opened up and students returned to on-campus learning. In addition, sales activity and the funding environment continues to be healthy. In the food segment, we saw growth across all regions except for China due to the shutdowns. The higher concentration of food business in China drove the food segment to decline low single digits against a very strong comparison of 22% growth last year. And rounding out our end-markets, environmental and forensics grew 1% versus an 8% growth last year. On a geographic basis, the Americas grew 13%, Europe grew 7%, Asia, excluding China grew 8%, while China declined 3% in the quarter as the lockdowns affected our manufacturing and logistics operations for over a month. Regarding China, I\u2019d like to provide some additional detail on how the quarter evolved and how we expect to see the recovery progress. First, as Mike said, demand remains strong with the order growth of about 20%, despite the temporary COVID lockdowns. Second, our business in China was tracking very well with our expectations through late March when production and our main logistics hub in Shanghai were shut down and remained closed throughout April. We were able to partially reduce the impact of the lockdown by shifting production to other factories where possible and adjusting the shipping routes into and out of China. We expect the $50 million to $55 million in revenue to be recovered throughout the rest of the calendar year, so it is deferred, not lost. In terms of phasing, we expect to continue to ramp our operations and anticipate modest recovery of the Q2 impact in Q3. We expect the majority of the recovery to occur in fiscal Q4 with some spillover into November and December, which is our first fiscal quarter of 2023. This phasing is baked into our updated guidance. Now turning to the P&L. The team continues to execute at a very high level. Second quarter gross margin was 55.7%, up 30 basis points from a year ago as pricing actions and productivity helped offset inflationary pressures tied to ongoing supply chain constraints and higher logistics costs. Operating expense leverage and strong cost management helped drive very healthy incremental improvements as we delivered an operating margin of 25.3%, up 140 basis points from last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was 50 basis points better than forecast, helping us deliver earnings per share of $1.13, up 16% versus last year, and exceeding our expectations. Looking at cash flow and our balance sheet, we generated operating cash flow of $283 million in the quarter while investing in $64 million in capital expenditures during Q2, with the year-on-year increase primarily related to the NASD expansion. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by the transitory impact of COVID-related lockdowns in China as well as increased inventory to fulfill strong demand in a challenging supply chain and logistics environment, as expected. We are still on track to deliver our cash flow forecast for the year. During the quarter, we again took advantage of market volatility to repurchase $234 million worth of shares. We also paid out $63 million in dividends, returning a combined total of $297 million to shareholders. Our balance sheet continues to be healthy with a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times. And earlier this month, we refinanced $600 million in senior notes opportunistically, and now have no long-term debt maturing until 2025. As we stated last quarter, our approach given current market conditions is to continue to be aggressive in deploying our capital. Given our strong balance sheet and confidence in the future, we intend to deploy another $250 million in opportunistic share repurchases in Q3 while continuing to actively look at M&A opportunities. Now, let\u2019s move to our improved full year guidance and our outlook for the third quarter. Given the strong business performance in the first half of the year and order backlog, we are raising our full year core revenue growth to an expected range of 8% to 9%, up a full point from our previous guide. This core revenue takes into account the recovery phasing in China, as well as a $35 million, or 55 basis-point headwind due to the conflict in Ukraine. While we\u2019ve increased our core growth expectations, the dollar has again strengthened considerably since our last guide, resulting in estimated currency headwinds of $170 million for the year, up $60 million since our last guide. And the impact of M&A remains unchanged. This results in us maintaining our full year reported revenue guidance range of $6.67 billion to $6.73 billion for the full year. We have also increased our EPS guidance for the full year to $4.86 to $4.93 per share. This is up from the previous range of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, and now represents 12% to 14% growth versus fiscal year 2021. For Q3, we\u2019re expecting revenue to range from $1.625 billion to $1.650 billion. This represents core growth between 7% and 9%. We expect operations in China to ramp and be fully operational before the end of the quarter and continue to accelerate into Q4. Given the strengthening of the dollar, exchange rates are expected to have a negative impact of about 4.7 points on the reported growth in the quarter. Closing out our guidance, in Q3 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.22, up 9% to 11% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14% tax rate and 300 million diluted shares outstanding. The Agilent team once again performed extremely well in Q2 under some very challenging circumstances. At the same time, our business remains strong, and I\u2019m confident we will continue to deliver strong results in Q3 and through the rest of the year. With that, Mike, I will turn it over to you for some concluding comments.\nMike McMullen: Thanks Bob. Before we take your questions, I would like to share some thoughts with you on the current environment. As you know, we\u2019re living in very dynamic times. However, our end markets remain strong. Our build and buy growth strategy is working. What is also very clear is the ability of the Agilent team to continue to deliver in a challenging external environment. We have built a resourceful, quick moving team and a resilient business model that has shown again-and-again, time-after-time, that we can successfully address any challenges or obstacles that come our way. We delivered inline growth, increased margins by 140 basis points and exceeded our EPS expectations during a time of rapidly growing inflation, continued supply chain challenges and the effects of a COVID-related lockdown in a key market. In times like this, our customers want to work with people and companies they can rely on. This works to our advantage, and I remain confident in our growth strategy continuing to deliver, and in the power of the unstoppable One Agilent team. Our growth drivers remain intact, and our business prospects remain strong now, and into the future. Thank you. And now, back to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Mike. Selena, please provide instructions for Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, certainly, you did mention this is an impressive performance given the relative fears on the Street on impact from China lockdowns. So, I guess, one, when you look at your peers, very strong instrument growth across LC and mass spec. Maybe could you talk about how did Agilent's portfolio within that instruments segment perform? What were the trends within the Q? Were there any lockdown impact for instruments and maybe order trends specific to instruments, please?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Vijay, thanks for the comments. We're really pleased with the performance given all the teams we're dealing with in the external environment. So, we're going to tag team the response here with myself and Jacob. So, the story is the -- our instrument business is doing very well. And in the call, we highlighted a few areas where we received an outstanding order growth. We talked about the cell analysis business, LC and LC/MS, particularly on the bio side, and I'll have Jacob add some specifics. And absolutely, as I tried to pull out in remarks, I think Jacob's business was disproportionately impacted by the shutdowns that we experienced of a COVID nature in China. So, we're very bullish about the strength of our LSAG business, exiting the quarter with record, record backlog. And Jacob, why don't you talk about what's been going on and why you're excited about the future?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Absolutely. Of course, the quarter was challenging with the Shanghai lockdown. But overall, we continue to see very strong growth in orders coming in, particularly in our LC, LC/MS business, which I think Mike alluded to also some of the NPIs we came out with approximately a year ago in the LC business. And with that connected with our very strong positioning in the mass spec, we continue to see very strong growth in that aspect. Clearly, with GC and GC/MS was challenged in China this year -- or this quarter due to the situation. But overall, the orders continue to be very strong. So, I'm not concerned about that. And besides that, I think we have seen also for the spectroscopy business that the material science is really a strength for us right now. So overall, very strong performance across the portfolio.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And hey, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to kind of dimensionalize that impact when we talk about disproportionate, roughly 80 to 85% of the impact due to the COVID lockdowns was instrument -- LSAG-related.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Bob. And maybe one on the top -- lockdown impact in China. The guidance is assuming that $50 million to $75 million comes back in the second half. What gives you the confidence that this is coming back in second half? And where are we in China? Have the markets reopened? Like is your production facility up and running? Because I know you have a GC manufacturing facility, and there have been some questions on perhaps there could be an impact in GC shipments out of China.\nMike McMullen: Vijay, how would I lead off the response here? So -- and this ties into why we have confidence about the outlook. So, we are back up and running in Shanghai, albeit on limited capacity. Both our logistics and production facilities are now up to 25% operating capacity. And we've actually started some limited international and in-country shipments. So product is starting to move. And we expect to have -- our view is that the lockdown controls will start to ease over the coming weeks and that we'll be fully operational by the end of the quarter, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here, and that's why I think Bob will describe a fairly modest recovery assumption in Q2. I'd also like to take this opportunity to call just to do a shout out to our team in Shanghai, who are actually camped out, living at the factory and not being asked and volunteering to do that. So, I've also got confidence in the outlook because I know what this team can do.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And to build on that point, Vijay, a couple of thoughts. I mean, we've watched the order backlog very closely. We haven't seen any cancellations associated with this. And as we're ramping up the factory in Shanghai, we also have dual manufacturing capabilities, and we continue to ramp up the factory here in the United States to be able to also provide GC and GC/MS. So, we are expecting, as Mike said, a very modest recovery of that $50 million to $55 million in Q3, the majority of it being in Q4 and then spilling over a little into November and December, but given the backlog and the fact that we haven't seen any of those orders cancelled, we feel like we definitely will get the product back. And if we go back to what happened in the initial phases of COVID, China dropped down pretty substantially and then came back fairly quickly, so.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Sykes: Congrats on a quarter in a tough environment. Maybe kind of following up on the instrument question, just dig a little bit more into C&E. Another good quarter there. And a couple of things you called out in terms of advanced materials, battery, semis. I mean, I think traditionally this has been looked at as sort of a highly cyclical sector, but when you're seeing sort of the secular growth drivers within those subsegments, it just seems less cyclical. Could you maybe kind of help us size that sort of cyclicality versus non-cyclicality within C&E? And what could be actually far more durable from an instrument growth standpoint in that segment over the course of this year and into next year?\nMike McMullen: So, I'm going to lead off with this and then tag team again with Jacob and Bob. But we completely agree with the premise of your question. In fact, you may recall some of our earlier presentations where we talked about there's elements of the C&E segment that aren't fully appreciated. They're being driven by capacity expansion for supply chain concerns, move to new materials, investments in semiconductor batteries. All you have to do is see what's happening in the whole automobile industry. We're a part of that. And I think it's important to just remind the audience here of the three segments that we have. And advanced materials grew, I think, mid-20s for us. The chemical side grew high teens. We were down in the energy segment. And I think that's been historically the more cyclical element of the business. But I think you need to keep in mind that that's less than 3% -- and energy side, less than 3% of Agilent's total revenues. And perhaps I'll pass it over to you, Bob and Jacob, to -- some commentary on the relative size of those buckets, if you will.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. I can also mention that Agilent has actually historically been very strong in material science. So, we have a very strong market presence both in the semicon industry, especially with our IC-PMS portfolio, but also with the GC, and generally speaking, in materials, in batteries and other renewable energy with our GC business. So I think we see a great potential in that. Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Just one other thing. I think on the -- just a couple of things. Energy was down. That is one area that was disproportionately impacted in China as well. So, we also had that impact. So, it wasn't -- it was a temporary phenomenon there. And then you can speak to -- it was -- China was also impacting the chemicals and advanced materials, and they still grew. So, that kind of speaks to the strength of those markets. And these are areas -- I mean it's our second-largest market. We have a leadership presence in these areas. And I would say it's just starting. When you think about the amount of capacity that's needed just for lithium-ion batteries as an example, we're only at a fraction of the capacity that needs to be there. So, these are probably $100 million-plus markets today that are having a long runway, if you just look at the cars and the opportunities here to continue to develop those. And that's just on the battery side. If you look at that, this is a very significant opportunity for us going forward, and we are definitely the leader.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks very much. I appreciate the color. And then just secondly, on the pricing side. Bob, you mentioned that some of the offsets on the gross margin pressure coming from pricing. Can you just kind of remind us of what your expectations are for pricing this year? And then, in terms of some of the actions you did last year, how quickly are you realizing some of those higher prices that you put in place?\nBob McMahon: Yes. It's a really good question. And we continue to be pleased by the ability for our value proposition to be recognized in the marketplace and actually having higher price than what we had initially had at the beginning of the year. If you recall, we had talked about roughly a 1-point year-on-year price realization. Q1, we were ahead of that. In Q2, we actually accelerated beyond that. And I would say most of the pricing that we're realizing today were for actions that we took most in the fall of last year and just starting to see some of the actions that we took in January of this year just given the strength of our backlog. So, it was above that. I would say in our new guide that we actually feel more optimistic about being able to be higher than that 1%. It was higher than that, certainly in Q2, which we needed because we -- our costs have been higher as well in terms of being able to have higher logistics costs given the price of oil and the cost of shipping. But we feel very good about our ability to continue to manage that across our entire portfolio.\nMike McMullen: Bob, I think it's also very well. We feel really pleased about the net price realization that's occurred. We also continue to drive productivity as well. So, it's a combination of pricing and productivity improvements we're having across the Company.\nBob McMahon: That's right. That's right, Mike.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.\nBrandon Couillard: Mike, biotech end market, very strong again in the second quarter. Just talk about sustainability of trends there and perhaps the impact of NASD specifically on the biotech segment growth.\nMike McMullen: Yes. So, I'll have you call that out, Bob. I know that's in our notes. And I think what you'll hear from Bob is it's a broad-based biopharma story with really strong growth in both sides of the market, the analytical lab and NASD. We remain quite bullish on the outlook in biopharma. In fact, we continue to actually gain new business. And actually, I'll have Padraig talk about in a second. We've actually expanded the number of accounts we're serving in the biopharma space. So we're feeling really good about the long-term growth aspects of biopharma as well as the impact it's having on the business right now. You heard me crone about a few of our growth numbers in the prepared remarks. And Bob, before I pass it over to Padraig for some comments, can you remind me what it was?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Our biopharma continues to -- first of all, Brandon, continues to be a greater proportion of the overall pharma market. So we're not only disproportionately growing in pharma, but the fastest-growing market continues to be bigger and bigger. It grew 27%. If you took out NASD, that number was still 19%. So, it still says that we have very strong growth there, and we grew backlog. And so, I feel very good about our offerings across both the instrumentation but then also across the entire portfolio of products and solutions that we have.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Bob. And I thought given the start of this fiscal year of our one commercial organization, maybe Padraig, you think some comments of how us helping to gain further penetration in the biopharma space.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Mike, we're absolutely seeing that we have a bigger focus on the longer tail of accounts or smaller biopharma accounts as well as the large players. And of course, our strong focus in biopharma was with application support and so on, really helps us with attach rate in that business. And it really helps the instrument trend with that attach rate. So overall, I think we see both services and consumer has been a very strong play and very strong enabler within -- in the biopharma accounts, which we're, of course, getting a lot more access to.\nBrandon Couillard: Got you. That's helpful. And then, the DGG gross margin at 56% are quite strong. Is that a mix dynamic or pricing? And should we think about mid-50s as sustainable for this business going forward now?\nMike McMullen: I'll let you and Sam hash that one out, Bob. Go ahead.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I think we certainly benefited from an extremely strong performance there. And Sam and team have continued to drive productivity in the business there. We did benefit from mix, but it -- I wouldn't necessarily put that number in for Q3 and Q4 because if you recall, one of the things that we are starting to do in the second half of the year is ramp up the start-up costs for Train B in our NASD facility and so forth. So -- and that hits our gross margin. But obviously, that has a great payoff in '23 with that $150 million-plus capacity. So, I would say the team had a benefit of mix. They're working on that productivity and activities. But I would say in the second half of the year, we probably will see some pressure because of some of that start-up costs.\nSam Raha: Bob, it's -- completely agree with everything you said. So, it is mix, it is volume. By the way, just also affirm we benefited from price. We have some leadership positions in the market, which we are absolutely able to go after. And continued good performance expected, though. As you said, the expectation is going to be a little tougher with NASD Train B coming on board.\nOperator: The next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Securities.\nPuneet Souda: So, first one, strong pharma, obviously. But just focusing on North America and pharma. Any reason why you shouldn't continue to see that in the second half, too? I mean, the question is more around instrumentation, and it's really around -- we're seeing your peers deliver very strong growth rate in U.S. pharma. So, wondering if there is any element of pull-forward you're seeing here. And should we see a sustained sort of growth rate when we think about North America and U.S. pharma?\nMike McMullen: Puneet, happy to answer that question. We're seeing the same phenomena. Pharma remains very, very strong in the U.S., and our outlook remains very bullish for the remainder of this year.\nBob McMahon: Yes. To give you perspective, I mean, our Americas business in pharma grew twice as fast as the overall pharma business. And we do -- we will have some comps in NASD that we won't be continuing to post a great -- the strong performance there -- as strong a performance, I should say, because we're ramping up against the capacity, which is what Train B is going to help us provide. But we're still seeing that very strong performance, particularly in the instrumentation that you were just asking about. That has been a standout.\nPuneet Souda: Okay, great. And then just briefly on another smaller segment, academic and government for you, that was strong in the quarter. Maybe could you just elaborate a little bit there what's driving that? And what sort of -- what are some of the elements of growth that we should continue to expect through the year? Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Yes. And as Bob mentioned -- this is Mike. That was a nice surprise for us. I think we came off a 21% compare and still grew 5%. So, we're seeing some positive developments. The funding environment seems to be quite healthy. And even though we had some COVID-related headwinds in the academia segment in China, even that area was strong. So, we think it's continuing to be a healthy funding environment. I think perhaps some of the COVID challenges we had as the society over the last several years has reinforced the importance of funding in those areas. As well, we're seeing return to labs or access for students and others in the lab activity as well. So, I think it's that combination of a healthy funding environment as well as lab access.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I think, Puneet, just to build on what Mike was talking about, if you go back to our first quarter results, we had January in our first quarter, and that was just coming off of Omicron -- the wave of Omicron. And we were talking about seeing increased activity starting in February as -- late in January, early February as kids were going back to school. We saw that continue throughout the course of our second quarter and really across the board. So, I think, it's pretty broad-based, particularly in our cell analysis business was one of the -- probably the strongest in that area and saw a really nice recovery after that first wave of Omicron there. And I think it continues to speak to kind of the value proposition that we have in cell analysis.\nOperator: The next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: Hey. It's Derik. Thanks for taking the questions. Just sort of follow-up on some things Puneet asked. So, we've been getting a lot of questions from investors basically asking if what the instrumentation sector is seeing is sort of like a pull-forward of the budget flush earlier in the year because customers are worried about delays in products, supply chains or anything like this. I mean, are you seeing any sort of like unusual order patterns? Or anything that's still suggesting it could be still catch-up orders from 2022 that didn't get -- sorry, for 2021 that didn't get shipped this year? Just like to because the instrumentation numbers have been just so strong across the group.\nMike McMullen: No. We haven't seen any indication of that. And I think the supply chain challenges, if you will, are no better, no worse. So, there's nothing that would be -- from a supply chain standpoint that would be encouraging customers. I got to get my order book now or I won't get a product. So we're not seeing that. We do think that some of the markets have seen an increase in their overall inherent long-term growth rate, particularly pharma, biopharma. We actually think some of the COVID challenges we had that I mentioned earlier have actually led to a more positive funding environment in some aspects of our marketplace. And Bob, I don't know if you have thoughts on this as well or...\nBob McMahon: Yes. I think from the standpoint of order growth, from a budget perspective, it only counts if they actually get the product, right? And so, if you look at -- the order growth continues to grow faster than revenue, which says, hey, from our standpoint, there's not necessarily pull-forward and it's just robust demand.\nDerik De Bruin: Got it. So, no sign of over-ordering, for example, that you can see? Okay. And I guess another question...\nBob McMahon: Derik, just one other thing, I think, just real quick on that. Yes, because we continue to look at -- we talked about it relative to China, but we look at it on a on a regional and global basis. And again, the order cancellations are at -- year-on-year, they're lower than they were last year. And last year, they were lower than the prior year. So, they continue to be at a very de minimis amount. It's something that we haven't seen more -- somebody is placing orders with multiple vendors and whoever can deliver gets the product first. I think it is consistent across the industry where we just are seeing very strong demand.\nDerik De Bruin: Got it. Thanks. That's really helpful. And just in terms of some of the competitive dynamics, I mean, it -- some of the other companies in the space have been talking about share shifts and changes going on in the markets and customers going on. I mean, it sounds like your order book is still -- I mean, did I hear you correctly you said mid-20s order growth in China? It doesn't sound like there's any sort of like change in the competitive dynamics going on in that region?\nMike McMullen: At least not with us.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I was going to say for some of our core technologies, it's mid-20s globally.\nMike McMullen: Yes. And we have included analytics on this, Derik, with win-loss ratio. So, we know what's going on with the business, and we can kind of parse through the rhetoric.\nOperator: The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Bob, maybe following up on that. Just looking at the guidance -- in terms of the guidance, obviously, you guys are typically pretty conservative. So, it's encouraging to see that 100 bp bump for the year. Can you just talk about, I guess, what gave you the confidence? It obviously implies a decent 4Q ramp. Is that just coming from exactly what you talked about there, the order growth, obviously, China coming back, visibility into that? Maybe just talk to the confidence level. Again, historically pretty conservative. So, that 100-bp bump off an in line quarter, maybe just talk through that a little bit. Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yes. No, you're spot on, Patrick. You hit on the two key points. One is the continued strength in our order book globally, where our orders continue to outpace our revenue. And then you build on that fact we have a strong conviction that the revenue deferred from China we will recover. And so, you see that in both, Q3 and really Q4. You see that step-up because of the strength. I would say our visibility remains high, particularly in the instrument side of the business with record backlogs across all of our technology stacks.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay, great. And then, Mike, maybe following up on one of the earlier questions on cyclicality.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nPatrick Donnelly: We get a lot of questions about recession sensitivity and thoughts about if there is a recession where the companies look like. You guys have obviously transformed the portfolio quite a bit since the last time we saw a real pullback. Can you just talk about the resiliency of the portfolio broadly, how you would think about, what this would look like into a recession? And then again, maybe just expand a little bit on what's cyclical, what's not across the entire portfolio there. And then similarly, Bob, just the levers on the cost side, if things were to slow.\nMike McMullen: So I'm going to make a few opening comments here. Then Bob has been doing a nice little set of model here. He has a few slides to reference, so he can give an even more precise answer. But I must use the word resiliency or resilient in my script comments at least 5 or 10 times because -- really to drive the point home that the Agilent business model, business portfolio, is significantly different than the last time that we've seen some type of recessionary pressure on the business. And at this point, for example, to a service business that just posted another 10% core revenue growth where I've got over 10% of my total company revenues under a service contract, whole consumables business, our NASD business, what we've been doing to really change the nature of our business and also deeper penetration in markets such as pharma, biopharma, which tend not to be as affected by a recessionary pressure if that was to occur. And Bob, I know this is something you're a keen student of, and I think we'd be happy to share some more insights here.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Thanks, Mike, and you're telling all my secrets with my secret pages here. But I think, Patrick, to your point, this is something -- as Mike was talking about, the portfolio really has dramatically changed. So, if you went back to probably '08, '09, the great financial crisis, our business was much more capital-intense, much more instrument-oriented than it is today. It was probably in the mid-30s in terms of services and consumables. And today, it's closer to 60%. And then, if you also look at it, the pharma and clinical businesses, which are probably more recession-resistant, they're now 50% -- greater than 50% of the entire company. And so, back then, we were pretty close to GDP. And if you just look at what happened in COVID 2020, one of the greatest shocks we had, actually, we still grew 1%. And so, you can see that we've got a much more resilient business model because of the higher concentration, not only in faster and more resilient markets like diagnostics and the pharma business. But then when you look at the types of products that we have, the greater element of services, a lot of them on contract, as Mike just talked about, but then the consumables piece and then the consumables and services a greater proportion of the business than we had before. And then, even in some of those areas that we talked about, the more -- we're traditionally viewed as cyclical, there's some longer-term growth drivers. I think that people are going to still transition from gas-powered cars to electrical cars. There's still going to be a regionalization of investments and capacity around semiconductors and so forth to bring them closer to the markets, whether that be here in the U.S., Europe and other places to diversify that supply chain. Those are things that weren't there in 2020 -- or in 2008-2009. So I think we've got some tailwinds from a market perspective, and the business composition looks very different.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: So, another question around biopharma. Biotech funding slowdowns have obviously been an area of concern. So, could you just talk about if you've seen any slowdown from customers related to funding concerns at all? And then, have you had any concern amongst challenging therapy customers? Or is that business really operating as expected as well?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So, let me leave with some thoughts on the biopharma, and maybe you want to jump in on the cell and gene therapy, Jacob. But no, we haven't seen it. We've seen some of the publicized concerns, but it's not showing up in our discussions with customers or in our order book or order funnel. In fact, that's why I pulled Padraig into the conversation earlier because we're actually expanding our penetration in there. So, the funding environment still remains strong for the products and services looking from Agilent. And then, I know that you've got something going on with Lonza right now already on the cell...\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. Actually, the -- overall the cell analysis business is doing really well, and we are -- we have a high penetration into biopharma. Actually, one of the areas we didn't have that high was in the Seahorse, where we were very balanced towards academia. And here over the last a period of time, we have launched a new product which is really penetrating into biopharma, really doubled our penetration into the biopharma for the -- especially for the gene and cell therapy area. Also the same for the our LC/MS business where we have a strong presence in the oligo, and we will further improve that over the next period of time here. So, we actually see a lot of strength still in that area. And as Mike mentioned, we also are committed to partnerships. Lonza, where they have built a new platform that can be a bioreactor that can actually -- that could be used out in the in the hospital settings. And we are working with them to improve that to put QC methodologies in there based on our cell analysis technology. So we are -- continue to be very bullish in this space.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey Rachel, one other thing, it's a question that's come up a number of times. So, we've done a fair amount of analysis. And as Mike and Jacob talked about, we haven't really -- we haven't seen any slowdown in the order book or any -- even in the elongation, any material elongation, in kind of the order conversion cycle, so to speak, in terms of getting from proposal to order. The other piece that I think is probably underappreciated is the penetration that we have actually into this market from a services and consumables base. And so, we have probably some of the highest attach rates in our biopharma businesses just because of the types of instruments that they buy and the amount of service uptime that they require. And as long as those customers don't go bankrupt, we'll still have that. And we haven't seen any material write-offs in any of those things. So, I think people think about it and go right to instrument, but there's a big component of services and consumables there, too, that will continue to be kind of the gift that keeps on giving.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thanks. That's really helpful. And then two more questions from me on C&E. So, last quarter, you listed the C&E guide for the year at high single digits to low double-digit growth. So, can you give us an update on if that outlook has changed at all given the 9% growth this quarter? And then, kind of diving deeper into C&E. So, you and your peers have touched on battery testing being an opportunity in that segment, and it's really starting to get some increasing traction. So can you walk us through that market opportunity and how meaningful that could be over time?\nBob McMahon: Yes. So,, our guidance for C&E hasn't changed. We were in line with the expectations for Q3 despite kind of the pushout of some of the China-related business. If you can -- GC and GC/MS have probably a higher concentration into the chemical and energy business. And actually, we still grew 9%. So, we're expecting to see a nice rebound into Q3 and Q4, primarily Q4 as that business comes back, and they're still on track to that double digit.\nMike McMullen: And Bob, I think it's fair to say it wasn't just C&E in China. It also was C&E globally where our product is provided by China for those customers.\nBob McMahon: And I think in terms of the areas around battery and technology and clean energy technology, and I would throw in kind of semiconductor in that and some of the capacity expansion. So on the battery technology, those are emerging areas that we've talked about for the last several quarters here. It's still an emerging technology. There's only a handful of battery manufacturers right now, but they are significantly increasing capacity around the world. And so, it's a several hundred million dollar kind of market opportunity today and growing quite substantially.\nOperator: The next question comes from Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research.\nJosh Waldman: I think one for you, Mike, and then one for Bob. Mike, just want to expand on the instrument backlog questions. I mean, curious if you could provide a bit more context on the backlog strength. Just trying to get a sense on how much of this is a reflection of stronger orders versus potentially a function of tighter supply, maybe even the China GC facility shutdown in fact. You talked on biopharma strength. Are you seeing order -- instrument orders from more cyclical accounts like applied and industrial also run ahead of expectations?\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think the story -- the headline story here is transitory impact on backlog build for an element of a COVID-19 lockdowns in China. But the big story -- the big macro story is orders continue to outpace revenue, so strong instrument demand across our two largest markets. And I can recall some of the questions we got earlier this year about, hey, what's the upside in your plan. We said, we think it sits in our two largest markets, pharma and C&E. And that's actually what's happening. So -- and I think we've probably got a little bit larger backlog build right now in C&E just because of the need to be able to deliver GCs from our Shanghai factory, albeit we were able to shift some of our production to our site in the U.S., and that's continuing to ramp. But again, I think the macro story here is really strong overall market environment for orders. And we're feeling really good about our ability to meet our customers' expectations on deliveries. We see customers continue to be satisfied with their relationship with Agilent. I think you saw me try to hit that in my closing comments. And then as Bob mentioned, we monitor very closely the level of order cancellations and continue to be delighted with where that stands.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey Josh, this is Bob to kind of build on that. If we kind of peeled the onion back and looked at the backlog for LSAG, it's significantly above where it was last year. It's hard to peel out. There have been some longer delivery times because of logistics, but I would say the majority of it is demand-driven. It is not because it's longer delivery times. I mean, even if you took the $50 million to $55 million out -- yes. Even if you took the $50 million to $55 million out, it's still significantly higher than what it would be historically. It's a record backlog even if you take the kind of the onetime $50 million to $55 million China deferral out.\nJosh Waldman: Okay. And then, Bob, can you bridge us to the new EPS outlook? I mean you beat Q2 guide by $0.01 at the high-end raise, the full year by $0.03. Just curious how strong organic growth and other variables like share repo, FX and margin are being accounted for in the new guide.\nBob McMahon: Yes. It's a good question. So, it's $0.01 for Q2 beat and basically $0.01 for Q3 and Q4 with the share repurchase helping us by a couple of points, offset by FX. I would say, it's a prudent guide.\nJosh Waldman: Oh, prudent guide. Okay.\nMike McMullen: We had to get that prudent in today. Didn't we, Bob?\nOperator: The next question comes from Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: I just wanted to keep going on chemical and energy. Just first, how much of the manufacturing headwind was in this end market, maybe versus food or environmental or elsewhere? I'm just guessing the underlying was a lot stronger than the 9% headline for the end market.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Your intuition, Jack, is spot on. We didn't -- for purposes of looking at this, we looked at it more on a technology stand rather than kind of end market. But if you look at most of it actually being in China, that's where most of the impact was. And that is a market that's over-indexed to food, chemical and energy and pharma. Those were the 3 biggest markets. Environmental and forensics does have an impact there as well, but it's probably less so than the other three that I just talked about.\nMike McMullen: I do recall we had some larger European orders in C&E that will be filled later because we couldn't get GCs to them this quarter -- this past quarter.\nJack Meehan: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just following up on NASD. Just the expectations in the back half of the year. You guys are the masters of eking out additional capacity and what you have today with Train A and the Frederick site. But is the expectation kind of revenue is more flattish from here for the remainder of the year? And then, just a quick clarification for Train B, talked about 2023. I think previously, you said end of this year, just don't know if there's any -- I'm reading too much into that, but just any comment on the time line would be great.\nMike McMullen: Bob, do you want to take the first one?\nBob McMahon: I'll take the first one, yes. So I think if we look at what we have been able to do in Q2, it was very strong growth. it is slightly better than flattish as we've kind of tapped out -- as we're maxed out right now in capacity. But as you point out, the team continues to do a fantastic job to bring out new capacity. I will say that we do have a shutdown -- a planned shutdown in Q3 as we're doing some of the installation of Train B, which will temporarily depress the revenue there. That's built into the guide. And so, there may be a slight sequential downturn, but that's all part of the overall plan.\nMike McMullen: And Jack, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had a chance -- actually, Bob and I and Sam had a chance to actually go down and spend time with the team to see firsthand does a great job there to thank them for their work. And they've really done a great job both winning new business as we looked into '23 but also meeting -- also supporting a major expansion of our production, which we've been referring to as Train B. And to answer your question, I would say is, first of all, there's no changes to our outlook in terms of 2023 revenue. We do think it's not likely that we'll start production this calendar year. So, it's most likely early calendar 2023. We've had some great support from the construction teams are supporting our effort here, but also have experienced some COVID-related to supply chain issues. But as you can imagine, Jack, we also were prudent in our initial outlook for 2023. So, don't read into that anything beyond the fact that it may take us a little bit longer to get the plant up and running, the new capacity up and running, but our revenue outlook for 2023 remains unchanged.\nJack Meehan: Super. And Mike, you said prudent now a couple of times but was just wondering, could you confirm, is the best still yet to come?\nMike McMullen: Absolutely. Thank you, Jack. The best is yet to come. We\u2019re Agilent. Right after this call, I'll be doing an earnings call video for the Agilent team and that might close. So -- and thank you very much for that, Jack.\nOperator: The next question comes from Daniel Arias with Stifel.\nDaniel Arias: Bob, I just wanted to maybe follow up on that pricing question and ask if there are areas in the portfolio where the backlog or the lead times are long enough to where you sort of need to go back and requote pricing for the current environment. Or is that not something that you really have in play? And if it is, how successful might you be in doing that?\nBob McMahon: Yes. I'll look to my colleague and Jacob, but we don't requote when we price. So we commit to the pricing at the time that the quote was valid or the order. And so, what we're seeing here is, if we take pricing in January, we just started seeing some of that flow through in the late second quarter just given the backlog. So, if we take pricing now, it's really in terms of anticipating you'll expect to see it sometime in late Q4, really into 2023.\nMike McMullen: You can write, Jacob?\nDaniel Arias: And then, maybe just on NAS -- oh, sorry, Jacob. Yes.\nMike McMullen: No, no, I was -- just sorry about that.\nDaniel Arias: I was just going to ask one about NASD and just sort of the way that the order book is building out for 2023. Is that more a reflection of where backlog is for NASD or just the acceptance time lines that you have customers talking about at this point?\nMike McMullen: Sam, why don't you speak to that? I know you spent time with Brian on the exact question.\nSam Raha: Yes. Happy to. Well, listen, I mean, the backdrop of the market continues to be a strong demand. And we're seeing that both, from existing clients that we have for materials we're making for them right now but as well as new programs. And we are seeing a lot of interest from new pharma clients as well. So, when you look at 2023, it's very healthy demand. In fact, we've already sold a very significant part of our capacity for 2023 and already working on opportunities for 2024 and beyond. And that's just the cycle and the maturity and I think the positive outlook for this segment and our leadership in it.\nBob McMahon: I was going to say, hey, Dan, just to build on what Sam is saying, I mean, this is really a class effect. I mean when we think about kind of the therapeutic areas and the proof of now several new products that are on the market, this is really -- you're seeing multiple big pharma and mid-cap pharma looking at therapeutic areas with this technology. And so it is really something that we're a leader in. We're building capacity aggressively. And it is really more a function of the market demand as opposed to anything from our standpoint of capacity. If we add more capacity, we'd have more revenue.\nDaniel Arias: So, just to maybe put a bow on that, incremental orders that are coming in now, is it possible for those to be delivered in 2022? Or are those 2023 deliveries just by virtue of what you're saying on capacity?\nBob McMahon: Yes. We're pretty much capped on 2022. We have all the business we're able to process this year. So it's really about 2023 and beyond at this point.\nOperator: The next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird.\nCatherine Schulte: I guess, first one on NASD, and then I have a follow-up on M&A. But with NASD, clearly, a lot of interest there, a lot of demand from customers. I think one of your main customers has a PDUFA date coming up in July. How do you think about evaluating capacity expansions even beyond Train B? And what should we be expecting to hear from you guys on that front?\nMike McMullen: Yes. We're actively working on the answer to that question right now. So nothing yet to share, but I can assure you there'll be more -- there's more letters in the alphabet than A and B. So you can expect us to continue to invest and expand this business.\nCatherine Schulte: All right. Perfect. And then, you mentioned in your comments -- yes. You mentioned your comments continuing to actively look at M&A opportunities. Can you just give us your latest thoughts there in terms of appetite and of size and substantial hurdles that you would be applying?\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think our appetite remains the same in terms of as part of our Build and Buy growth strategy. We've indicated previously that we have an appetite to do a larger M&A that we done historically. We've talked about it being multiples of the BioTek acquisition. It's really just a matter of making sure we find the targets that make the most sense for us strategically, and of course, making sure they create value for our shareholders. And we have remained disciplined through all the hype of the -- of what we experienced last year with the SPACs and IPOs coming out, et cetera. I think the market is still -- is now becoming a little more rational in terms of -- and I say a little bit more rational in terms of price expectations, albeit not everybody has forgotten what they thought they once were or were 6 or 7 months ago, Bob. So we remain very active nothing to announce, but this remains a priority for the Company. But we're not going to do deals just to do deals. We have to do deals that makes sense for our shareholders.\nOperator: There are no further questions registered at this time. And that concludes the Q&A session. I'll pass the conference back to Parmeet to conclude the call.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Selena. And thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of the day.\nOperator: That concludes the Agilent Technologies Inc. Q2 2022 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

We have some leadership positions in the market, which we are absolutely able to go after. And continued good performance expected, though. As you said, the expectation is going to be a little tougher with NASD Train B coming on board. Yes. Happy to. Well, listen, I mean, the backdrop of the market continues to be a strong demand.

            "name": "Jacob Thaysen",
            "content": "Yes. Absolutely. Of course, the quarter was challenging with the Shanghai lockdown. But overall, we continue to see very strong growth in orders coming in, particularly in our LC, LC/MS business, which I think Mike alluded to also some of the NPIs we came out with approximately a year ago in the LC business. And with that connected with our very strong positioning in the mass spec, we continue to see very strong growth in that aspect. Clearly, with GC and GC/MS was challenged in China this year -- or this quarter due to the situation. But overall, the orders continue to be very strong. So, I'm not concerned about that. And besides that, I think we have seen also for the spectroscopy business that the material science is really a strength for us right now. So overall, very strong performance across the portfolio. Yes. I can also mention that Agilent has actually historically been very strong in material science. So, we have a very strong market presence both in the semicon industry, especially with our IC-PMS portfolio, but also with the GC, and generally speaking, in materials, in batteries and other renewable energy with our GC business. So I think we see a great potential in that. Bob? Yes. Actually, the -- overall the cell analysis business is doing really well, and we are -- we have a high penetration into biopharma. Actually, one of the areas we didn't have that high was in the Seahorse, where we were very balanced towards academia. And here over the last a period of time, we have launched a new product which is really penetrating into biopharma, really doubled our penetration into the biopharma for the -- especially for the gene and cell therapy area.

So overall, I think we see both services and consumer has been a very strong play and very strong enabler within -- in the biopharma accounts, which we're, of course, getting a lot more access to."

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks Parmeet, and thanks to everyone for joining our call today. In Q2, the Agilent team again demonstrated the resilience and strength of our business model. We delivered core revenue growth in line with our forecast, expanded operating margins, and exceeded our EPS expectations. We did this while navigating a dynamic macro environment, including the conflict in Ukraine and COVID-related lockdowns in China. Our Q2 revenues are $1.61 billion. This is up 7% core and is on top of growing 19% in Q2 a year ago. Order performance was even stronger growing double digits on a core basis. Second quarter operating margins at 25.3% continued to expand, up 140 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.13 are up 16%. We achieved these results despite the COVID-related lockdowns that closed our operations in Shanghai, starting in late March and continuing through the entire month of April. We estimate that this is roughly a 350-basis point headwind to our core revenue growth for the quarter. As Bob will indicate when he takes you through the details, this business is not lost and is expected to be recovered through the rest of the calendar year. Most importantly, our team in China is safe, and we restarted limited operations in May at our GC factory and logistics center in Shanghai. From an end-market perspective, the pharma and chemical and energy markets again led the way for us. Our pharma business, Agilent\u2019s largest market, grew 13%, led by biopharma growing high 20s. This represents our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the pharma market. It also builds on top of a stellar 29% growth rate last year. The momentum in our chemical and energy business also continued this quarter, delivering 9% growth in line with expectations and overcoming the shutdown of our primary GC production facility in Shanghai and the conflict in Ukraine. Growth was driven by advanced materials and chemicals. On a geographic basis, the Americas again led the way with 13% growth built on top of 27% growth a year ago. Europe also performed well with growth coming in at 7% following 16% growth last year. China revenues were on track with our expectations through March, but we exited the quarter down 3% given the COVID-related lockdowns. While revenues were affected by the temporary shutdowns in the quarter, overall demand in China remains very robust. In fact, China was the fastest growing region in Q2 from an order perspective, up about 20%. We remain very confident about the ongoing strength of our business in China. Looking at performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $896 million, an increase of 4% on a core basis. Given our manufacturing footprint and relative strength in China, LSAG was disproportionately impacted by the COVID-related shutdowns there. To provide some additional perspective, all major product lines, excluding GC related products, grew solidly in the quarter, led by strong performance in our cell analysis business growing in the mid-teens. Orders for LC and LC/MS continued to be strong. Orders grew mid-20\u2019s globally with particularly high adoption of our two new Bio-LC products. On the LC/MS front, we look forward to announcing several exciting new offerings at the upcoming ASMS conference that will expand our portfolio. Our value proposition continues to resonate with our customers and LSAG exited the quarter with record backlog. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenues of $353 million. This is up 10% core. Growth in services was again broad-based across services contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education, and informatic enterprise services. The scale of our ACG business and breadth of portfolio continued to drive growth and margin expansion even in the face of inflationary pressures. Q2 marked the sixth straight quarter we\u2019ve delivered growth across all markets and regions. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $358 million, up 15% core versus 16% last year. Our excellent growth was led by NASD and genomics. The NASD team delivered yet another strong quarter, generating record revenue and profitability. During the quarter, I had a chance to visit our team in Colorado and see first-hand the excellent progress that\u2019s being made meeting current customer needs and also the work underway in continuing to build for future growth with our Train B expansion. We remain extremely bullish about NASD\u2019s future and with Train B coming online in 2023, we\u2019re adding yet another $150 million plus in capacity. Looking across the company, our One Agilent approach and focus on our customers has never been stronger. During the quarter, we were ranked number one in our industry and number two overall in customer satisfaction in The Management 250 ranking, developed by the Drucker Institute. In addition, the new Agilent Commercial organization is already resonating well and delivering successfully for our customers. Agilent\u2019s Q2 results are yet another proof point for how we build a resilient company that can quickly adjust to a changing environment and still post strong results. Given our results to date, along with our backlog and continued order strength, we are again raising our full year core revenue growth and EPS guidance. For the year, we are now expecting 8% to 9% core revenue growth and EPS of $4.86 to $4.93. Bob will provide more detail on our Q3 outlook along with more information on what we expect for the rest of the year. After Bob\u2019s comments and before we take your questions, I will be rejoining the call for some concluding remarks. Thank you for being on the call today, and now I will hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Thanks Bob. Before we take your questions, I would like to share some thoughts with you on the current environment. As you know, we\u2019re living in very dynamic times. However, our end markets remain strong. Our build and buy growth strategy is working. What is also very clear is the ability of the Agilent team to continue to deliver in a challenging external environment. We have built a resourceful, quick moving team and a resilient business model that has shown again-and-again, time-after-time, that we can successfully address any challenges or obstacles that come our way. We delivered inline growth, increased margins by 140 basis points and exceeded our EPS expectations during a time of rapidly growing inflation, continued supply chain challenges and the effects of a COVID-related lockdown in a key market. In times like this, our customers want to work with people and companies they can rely on. This works to our advantage, and I remain confident in our growth strategy continuing to deliver, and in the power of the unstoppable One Agilent team. Our growth drivers remain intact, and our business prospects remain strong now, and into the future. Thank you. And now, back to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet? Yes. Vijay, thanks for the comments. We're really pleased with the performance given all the teams we're dealing with in the external environment. So, we're going to tag team the response here with myself and Jacob. So, the story is the -- our instrument business is doing very well. And in the call, we highlighted a few areas where we received an outstanding order growth. We talked about the cell analysis business, LC and LC/MS, particularly on the bio side, and I'll have Jacob add some specifics. And absolutely, as I tried to pull out in remarks, I think Jacob's business was disproportionately impacted by the shutdowns that we experienced of a COVID nature in China. So, we're very bullish about the strength of our LSAG business, exiting the quarter with record, record backlog. And Jacob, why don't you talk about what's been going on and why you're excited about the future? Vijay, how would I lead off the response here? So -- and this ties into why we have confidence about the outlook. So, we are back up and running in Shanghai, albeit on limited capacity. Both our logistics and production facilities are now up to 25% operating capacity. And we've actually started some limited international and in-country shipments. So product is starting to move. And we expect to have -- our view is that the lockdown controls will start to ease over the coming weeks and that we'll be fully operational by the end of the quarter, but we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here, and that's why I think Bob will describe a fairly modest recovery assumption in Q2. I'd also like to take this opportunity to call just to do a shout out to our team in Shanghai, who are actually camped out, living at the factory and not being asked and volunteering to do that. So, I've also got confidence in the outlook because I know what this team can do. So, I'm going to lead off with this and then tag team again with Jacob and Bob. But we completely agree with the premise of your question. In fact, you may recall some of our earlier presentations where we talked about there's elements of the C&E segment that aren't fully appreciated. They're being driven by capacity expansion for supply chain concerns, move to new materials, investments in semiconductor batteries. All you have to do is see what's happening in the whole automobile industry. We're a part of that. And I think it's important to just remind the audience here of the three segments that we have. And advanced materials grew, I think, mid-20s for us. The chemical side grew high teens. We were down in the energy segment. And I think that's been historically the more cyclical element of the business. But I think you need to keep in mind that that's less than 3% -- and energy side, less than 3% of Agilent's total revenues. And perhaps I'll pass it over to you, Bob and Jacob, to -- some commentary on the relative size of those buckets, if you will. Bob, I think it's also very well. We feel really pleased about the net price realization that's occurred. We also continue to drive productivity as well. So, it's a combination of pricing and productivity improvements we're having across the Company. Yes. So, I'll have you call that out, Bob. I know that's in our notes. And I think what you'll hear from Bob is it's a broad-based biopharma story with really strong growth in both sides of the market, the analytical lab and NASD. We remain quite bullish on the outlook in biopharma. In fact, we continue to actually gain new business. And actually, I'll have Padraig talk about in a second. We've actually expanded the number of accounts we're serving in the biopharma space. So we're feeling really good about the long-term growth aspects of biopharma as well as the impact it's having on the business right now. You heard me crone about a few of our growth numbers in the prepared remarks. And Bob, before I pass it over to Padraig for some comments, can you remind me what it was? Yes. Thanks, Bob. And I thought given the start of this fiscal year of our one commercial organization, maybe Padraig, you think some comments of how us helping to gain further penetration in the biopharma space. I'll let you and Sam hash that one out, Bob. Go ahead. Puneet, happy to answer that question. We're seeing the same phenomena. Pharma remains very, very strong in the U.S., and our outlook remains very bullish for the remainder of this year. Yes. And as Bob mentioned -- this is Mike. That was a nice surprise for us. I think we came off a 21% compare and still grew 5%. So, we're seeing some positive developments. The funding environment seems to be quite healthy. And even though we had some COVID-related headwinds in the academia segment in China, even that area was strong. So, we think it's continuing to be a healthy funding environment. I think perhaps some of the COVID challenges we had as the society over the last several years has reinforced the importance of funding in those areas. As well, we're seeing return to labs or access for students and others in the lab activity as well. So, I think it's that combination of a healthy funding environment as well as lab access. No. We haven't seen any indication of that. And I think the supply chain challenges, if you will, are no better, no worse. So, there's nothing that would be -- from a supply chain standpoint that would be encouraging customers. I got to get my order book now or I won't get a product. So we're not seeing that. We do think that some of the markets have seen an increase in their overall inherent long-term growth rate, particularly pharma, biopharma. We actually think some of the COVID challenges we had that I mentioned earlier have actually led to a more positive funding environment in some aspects of our marketplace. And Bob, I don't know if you have thoughts on this as well or... At least not with us. Yes. And we have included analytics on this, Derik, with win-loss ratio. So, we know what's going on with the business, and we can kind of parse through the rhetoric. Sure. So I'm going to make a few opening comments here. Then Bob has been doing a nice little set of model here. He has a few slides to reference, so he can give an even more precise answer. But I must use the word resiliency or resilient in my script comments at least 5 or 10 times because -- really to drive the point home that the Agilent business model, business portfolio, is significantly different than the last time that we've seen some type of recessionary pressure on the business. And at this point, for example, to a service business that just posted another 10% core revenue growth where I've got over 10% of my total company revenues under a service contract, whole consumables business, our NASD business, what we've been doing to really change the nature of our business and also deeper penetration in markets such as pharma, biopharma, which tend not to be as affected by a recessionary pressure if that was to occur. And Bob, I know this is something you're a keen student of, and I think we'd be happy to share some more insights here. Yes. So, let me leave with some thoughts on the biopharma, and maybe you want to jump in on the cell and gene therapy, Jacob. But no, we haven't seen it. We've seen some of the publicized concerns, but it's not showing up in our discussions with customers or in our order book or order funnel. In fact, that's why I pulled Padraig into the conversation earlier because we're actually expanding our penetration in there. So, the funding environment still remains strong for the products and services looking from Agilent. And then, I know that you've got something going on with Lonza right now already on the cell... And Bob, I think it's fair to say it wasn't just C&E in China. It also was C&E globally where our product is provided by China for those customers. Yes. I think the story -- the headline story here is transitory impact on backlog build for an element of a COVID-19 lockdowns in China. But the big story -- the big macro story is orders continue to outpace revenue, so strong instrument demand across our two largest markets. And I can recall some of the questions we got earlier this year about, hey, what's the upside in your plan. We said, we think it sits in our two largest markets, pharma and C&E. And that's actually what's happening. So -- and I think we've probably got a little bit larger backlog build right now in C&E just because of the need to be able to deliver GCs from our Shanghai factory, albeit we were able to shift some of our production to our site in the U.S., and that's continuing to ramp. But again, I think the macro story here is really strong overall market environment for orders. And we're feeling really good about our ability to meet our customers' expectations on deliveries. We see customers continue to be satisfied with their relationship with Agilent. I think you saw me try to hit that in my closing comments. And then as Bob mentioned, we monitor very closely the level of order cancellations and continue to be delighted with where that stands. We had to get that prudent in today. Didn't we, Bob? I do recall we had some larger European orders in C&E that will be filled later because we couldn't get GCs to them this quarter -- this past quarter. Bob, do you want to take the first one? And Jack, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had a chance -- actually, Bob and I and Sam had a chance to actually go down and spend time with the team to see firsthand does a great job there to thank them for their work. And they've really done a great job both winning new business as we looked into '23 but also meeting -- also supporting a major expansion of our production, which we've been referring to as Train B. And to answer your question, I would say is, first of all, there's no changes to our outlook in terms of 2023 revenue. We do think it's not likely that we'll start production this calendar year. So, it's most likely early calendar 2023. We've had some great support from the construction teams are supporting our effort here, but also have experienced some COVID-related to supply chain issues. But as you can imagine, Jack, we also were prudent in our initial outlook for 2023. So, don't read into that anything beyond the fact that it may take us a little bit longer to get the plant up and running, the new capacity up and running, but our revenue outlook for 2023 remains unchanged. Absolutely. Thank you, Jack. The best is yet to come. We\u2019re Agilent. Right after this call, I'll be doing an earnings call video for the Agilent team and that might close. So -- and thank you very much for that, Jack. You can write, Jacob? No, no, I was -- just sorry about that. Sam, why don't you speak to that? I know you spent time with Brian on the exact question. Yes. We're actively working on the answer to that question right now. So nothing yet to share, but I can assure you there'll be more -- there's more letters in the alphabet than A and B. So you can expect us to continue to invest and expand this business. Yes. I think our appetite remains the same in terms of as part of our Build and Buy growth strategy. We've indicated previously that we have an appetite to do a larger M&A that we done historically. We've talked about it being multiples of the BioTek acquisition. It's really just a matter of making sure we find the targets that make the most sense for us strategically, and of course, making sure they create value for our shareholders. And we have remained disciplined through all the hype of the -- of what we experienced last year with the SPACs and IPOs coming out, et cetera. I think the market is still -- is now becoming a little more rational in terms of -- and I say a little bit more rational in terms of price expectations, albeit not everybody has forgotten what they thought they once were or were 6 or 7 months ago, Bob. So we remain very active nothing to announce, but this remains a priority for the Company. But we're not going to do deals just to do deals. We have to do deals that makes sense for our shareholders."

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue and take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our guidance for the third quarter and the fiscal year. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike described, we posted solid topline results in Q2 while overcoming some difficult macro challenges in the business environment. Revenue was $1.61 billion, up a reported 5.4%. In the current quarter, currency was a headwind of 2.1 points while M&A added 20 basis points of growth. Core growth was up 7.3%, in line with expectations despite the COVID-related lockdowns in China, which primarily affected us in April. We estimate the lockdowns deferred $50 million to $55 million of revenue into future quarters, impacting growth in Q2 by roughly 350 basis points. In addition, COVID testing-related revenues were roughly a one-point headwind in the quarter. Our largest market, pharma, grew 13% during the quarter, on top of 29% growth last year. Biopharma continued to be the main driver of results, growing 27% year-on-year, led by NASD. Investments in R&D programs and demand for instrumentation, consumables and critical components remained strong. Pharma represented 37% of our overall revenues this quarter. To put that in perspective, in Q2 2019, effectively one year before the pandemic started, pharma represented just 30% of our business. This not only highlights the strength and resilience of this market, but it also demonstrates how our innovation and investments in higher growth markets continues to pay off. Chemical and energy continued its strong trend of positive results, growing 9% during the quarter despite the impact of the COVID-related lockdowns in China and the conflict in Ukraine. Results were led by strong double-digit growth in advanced materials and specialty chemicals. We expect strong demand to continue in these areas, particularly in semiconductors and battery and clean energy technologies as industry-wide capacity expands. Diagnostics and clinical grew 5% on top of 13% growth last year as year-on-year declines in COVID-related revenues and the temporary shutdowns in China muted our results. The academia and government market was a nice surprise for us, growing 5% in Q2 on top of 21% growth last year. We saw an increase in spending in this market as more university labs opened up and students returned to on-campus learning. In addition, sales activity and the funding environment continues to be healthy. In the food segment, we saw growth across all regions except for China due to the shutdowns. The higher concentration of food business in China drove the food segment to decline low single digits against a very strong comparison of 22% growth last year. And rounding out our end-markets, environmental and forensics grew 1% versus an 8% growth last year. On a geographic basis, the Americas grew 13%, Europe grew 7%, Asia, excluding China grew 8%, while China declined 3% in the quarter as the lockdowns affected our manufacturing and logistics operations for over a month. Regarding China, I\u2019d like to provide some additional detail on how the quarter evolved and how we expect to see the recovery progress. First, as Mike said, demand remains strong with the order growth of about 20%, despite the temporary COVID lockdowns. Second, our business in China was tracking very well with our expectations through late March when production and our main logistics hub in Shanghai were shut down and remained closed throughout April. We were able to partially reduce the impact of the lockdown by shifting production to other factories where possible and adjusting the shipping routes into and out of China. We expect the $50 million to $55 million in revenue to be recovered throughout the rest of the calendar year, so it is deferred, not lost. In terms of phasing, we expect to continue to ramp our operations and anticipate modest recovery of the Q2 impact in Q3. We expect the majority of the recovery to occur in fiscal Q4 with some spillover into November and December, which is our first fiscal quarter of 2023. This phasing is baked into our updated guidance. Now turning to the P&L. The team continues to execute at a very high level. Second quarter gross margin was 55.7%, up 30 basis points from a year ago as pricing actions and productivity helped offset inflationary pressures tied to ongoing supply chain constraints and higher logistics costs. Operating expense leverage and strong cost management helped drive very healthy incremental improvements as we delivered an operating margin of 25.3%, up 140 basis points from last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was 50 basis points better than forecast, helping us deliver earnings per share of $1.13, up 16% versus last year, and exceeding our expectations. Looking at cash flow and our balance sheet, we generated operating cash flow of $283 million in the quarter while investing in $64 million in capital expenditures during Q2, with the year-on-year increase primarily related to the NASD expansion. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by the transitory impact of COVID-related lockdowns in China as well as increased inventory to fulfill strong demand in a challenging supply chain and logistics environment, as expected. We are still on track to deliver our cash flow forecast for the year. During the quarter, we again took advantage of market volatility to repurchase $234 million worth of shares. We also paid out $63 million in dividends, returning a combined total of $297 million to shareholders. Our balance sheet continues to be healthy with a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times. And earlier this month, we refinanced $600 million in senior notes opportunistically, and now have no long-term debt maturing until 2025. As we stated last quarter, our approach given current market conditions is to continue to be aggressive in deploying our capital. Given our strong balance sheet and confidence in the future, we intend to deploy another $250 million in opportunistic share repurchases in Q3 while continuing to actively look at M&A opportunities. Now, let\u2019s move to our improved full year guidance and our outlook for the third quarter. Given the strong business performance in the first half of the year and order backlog, we are raising our full year core revenue growth to an expected range of 8% to 9%, up a full point from our previous guide. This core revenue takes into account the recovery phasing in China, as well as a $35 million, or 55 basis-point headwind due to the conflict in Ukraine. While we\u2019ve increased our core growth expectations, the dollar has again strengthened considerably since our last guide, resulting in estimated currency headwinds of $170 million for the year, up $60 million since our last guide. And the impact of M&A remains unchanged. This results in us maintaining our full year reported revenue guidance range of $6.67 billion to $6.73 billion for the full year. We have also increased our EPS guidance for the full year to $4.86 to $4.93 per share. This is up from the previous range of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, and now represents 12% to 14% growth versus fiscal year 2021. For Q3, we\u2019re expecting revenue to range from $1.625 billion to $1.650 billion. This represents core growth between 7% and 9%. We expect operations in China to ramp and be fully operational before the end of the quarter and continue to accelerate into Q4. Given the strengthening of the dollar, exchange rates are expected to have a negative impact of about 4.7 points on the reported growth in the quarter. Closing out our guidance, in Q3 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.20 to $1.22, up 9% to 11% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14% tax rate and 300 million diluted shares outstanding. The Agilent team once again performed extremely well in Q2 under some very challenging circumstances. At the same time, our business remains strong, and I\u2019m confident we will continue to deliver strong results in Q3 and through the rest of the year. With that, Mike, I will turn it over to you for some concluding comments. Yes. And hey, Vijay, this is Bob. Just to kind of dimensionalize that impact when we talk about disproportionate, roughly 80 to 85% of the impact due to the COVID lockdowns was instrument -- LSAG-related. Yes. And to build on that point, Vijay, a couple of thoughts. I mean, we've watched the order backlog very closely. We haven't seen any cancellations associated with this. And as we're ramping up the factory in Shanghai, we also have dual manufacturing capabilities, and we continue to ramp up the factory here in the United States to be able to also provide GC and GC/MS. So, we are expecting, as Mike said, a very modest recovery of that $50 million to $55 million in Q3, the majority of it being in Q4 and then spilling over a little into November and December, but given the backlog and the fact that we haven't seen any of those orders cancelled, we feel like we definitely will get the product back. And if we go back to what happened in the initial phases of COVID, China dropped down pretty substantially and then came back fairly quickly, so. Yes. Just one other thing. I think on the -- just a couple of things. Energy was down. That is one area that was disproportionately impacted in China as well. So, we also had that impact. So, it wasn't -- it was a temporary phenomenon there. And then you can speak to -- it was -- China was also impacting the chemicals and advanced materials, and they still grew. So, that kind of speaks to the strength of those markets. And these are areas -- I mean it's our second-largest market. We have a leadership presence in these areas. And I would say it's just starting. When you think about the amount of capacity that's needed just for lithium-ion batteries as an example, we're only at a fraction of the capacity that needs to be there. So, these are probably $100 million-plus markets today that are having a long runway, if you just look at the cars and the opportunities here to continue to develop those. And that's just on the battery side. If you look at that, this is a very significant opportunity for us going forward, and we are definitely the leader. Yes. It's a really good question. And we continue to be pleased by the ability for our value proposition to be recognized in the marketplace and actually having higher price than what we had initially had at the beginning of the year. If you recall, we had talked about roughly a 1-point year-on-year price realization. Q1, we were ahead of that. In Q2, we actually accelerated beyond that. And I would say most of the pricing that we're realizing today were for actions that we took most in the fall of last year and just starting to see some of the actions that we took in January of this year just given the strength of our backlog. So, it was above that. I would say in our new guide that we actually feel more optimistic about being able to be higher than that 1%. It was higher than that, certainly in Q2, which we needed because we -- our costs have been higher as well in terms of being able to have higher logistics costs given the price of oil and the cost of shipping. But we feel very good about our ability to continue to manage that across our entire portfolio. That's right. That's right, Mike. Yes. Our biopharma continues to -- first of all, Brandon, continues to be a greater proportion of the overall pharma market. So we're not only disproportionately growing in pharma, but the fastest-growing market continues to be bigger and bigger. It grew 27%. If you took out NASD, that number was still 19%. So, it still says that we have very strong growth there, and we grew backlog. And so, I feel very good about our offerings across both the instrumentation but then also across the entire portfolio of products and solutions that we have. Yes. I think we certainly benefited from an extremely strong performance there. And Sam and team have continued to drive productivity in the business there. We did benefit from mix, but it -- I wouldn't necessarily put that number in for Q3 and Q4 because if you recall, one of the things that we are starting to do in the second half of the year is ramp up the start-up costs for Train B in our NASD facility and so forth. So -- and that hits our gross margin. But obviously, that has a great payoff in '23 with that $150 million-plus capacity. So, I would say the team had a benefit of mix. They're working on that productivity and activities. But I would say in the second half of the year, we probably will see some pressure because of some of that start-up costs. Yes. To give you perspective, I mean, our Americas business in pharma grew twice as fast as the overall pharma business. And we do -- we will have some comps in NASD that we won't be continuing to post a great -- the strong performance there -- as strong a performance, I should say, because we're ramping up against the capacity, which is what Train B is going to help us provide. But we're still seeing that very strong performance, particularly in the instrumentation that you were just asking about. That has been a standout. Yes. I think, Puneet, just to build on what Mike was talking about, if you go back to our first quarter results, we had January in our first quarter, and that was just coming off of Omicron -- the wave of Omicron. And we were talking about seeing increased activity starting in February as -- late in January, early February as kids were going back to school. We saw that continue throughout the course of our second quarter and really across the board. So, I think, it's pretty broad-based, particularly in our cell analysis business was one of the -- probably the strongest in that area and saw a really nice recovery after that first wave of Omicron there. And I think it continues to speak to kind of the value proposition that we have in cell analysis. Yes. I think from the standpoint of order growth, from a budget perspective, it only counts if they actually get the product, right? And so, if you look at -- the order growth continues to grow faster than revenue, which says, hey, from our standpoint, there's not necessarily pull-forward and it's just robust demand. Derik, just one other thing, I think, just real quick on that. Yes, because we continue to look at -- we talked about it relative to China, but we look at it on a on a regional and global basis. And again, the order cancellations are at -- year-on-year, they're lower than they were last year. And last year, they were lower than the prior year. So, they continue to be at a very de minimis amount. It's something that we haven't seen more -- somebody is placing orders with multiple vendors and whoever can deliver gets the product first. I think it is consistent across the industry where we just are seeing very strong demand. Yes. I was going to say for some of our core technologies, it's mid-20s globally. Yes. No, you're spot on, Patrick. You hit on the two key points. One is the continued strength in our order book globally, where our orders continue to outpace our revenue. And then you build on that fact we have a strong conviction that the revenue deferred from China we will recover. And so, you see that in both, Q3 and really Q4. You see that step-up because of the strength. I would say our visibility remains high, particularly in the instrument side of the business with record backlogs across all of our technology stacks. Yes. Thanks, Mike, and you're telling all my secrets with my secret pages here. But I think, Patrick, to your point, this is something -- as Mike was talking about, the portfolio really has dramatically changed. So, if you went back to probably '08, '09, the great financial crisis, our business was much more capital-intense, much more instrument-oriented than it is today. It was probably in the mid-30s in terms of services and consumables. And today, it's closer to 60%. And then, if you also look at it, the pharma and clinical businesses, which are probably more recession-resistant, they're now 50% -- greater than 50% of the entire company. And so, back then, we were pretty close to GDP. And if you just look at what happened in COVID 2020, one of the greatest shocks we had, actually, we still grew 1%. And so, you can see that we've got a much more resilient business model because of the higher concentration, not only in faster and more resilient markets like diagnostics and the pharma business. But then when you look at the types of products that we have, the greater element of services, a lot of them on contract, as Mike just talked about, but then the consumables piece and then the consumables and services a greater proportion of the business than we had before. And then, even in some of those areas that we talked about, the more -- we're traditionally viewed as cyclical, there's some longer-term growth drivers. I think that people are going to still transition from gas-powered cars to electrical cars. There's still going to be a regionalization of investments and capacity around semiconductors and so forth to bring them closer to the markets, whether that be here in the U.S., Europe and other places to diversify that supply chain. Those are things that weren't there in 2020 -- or in 2008-2009. So I think we've got some tailwinds from a market perspective, and the business composition looks very different. Yes. Hey Rachel, one other thing, it's a question that's come up a number of times. So, we've done a fair amount of analysis. And as Mike and Jacob talked about, we haven't really -- we haven't seen any slowdown in the order book or any -- even in the elongation, any material elongation, in kind of the order conversion cycle, so to speak, in terms of getting from proposal to order. The other piece that I think is probably underappreciated is the penetration that we have actually into this market from a services and consumables base. And so, we have probably some of the highest attach rates in our biopharma businesses just because of the types of instruments that they buy and the amount of service uptime that they require. And as long as those customers don't go bankrupt, we'll still have that. And we haven't seen any material write-offs in any of those things. So, I think people think about it and go right to instrument, but there's a big component of services and consumables there, too, that will continue to be kind of the gift that keeps on giving. Yes. So,, our guidance for C&E hasn't changed. We were in line with the expectations for Q3 despite kind of the pushout of some of the China-related business. If you can -- GC and GC/MS have probably a higher concentration into the chemical and energy business. And actually, we still grew 9%. So, we're expecting to see a nice rebound into Q3 and Q4, primarily Q4 as that business comes back, and they're still on track to that double digit. And I think in terms of the areas around battery and technology and clean energy technology, and I would throw in kind of semiconductor in that and some of the capacity expansion. So on the battery technology, those are emerging areas that we've talked about for the last several quarters here. It's still an emerging technology. There's only a handful of battery manufacturers right now, but they are significantly increasing capacity around the world. And so, it's a several hundred million dollar kind of market opportunity today and growing quite substantially. Yes. Hey Josh, this is Bob to kind of build on that. If we kind of peeled the onion back and looked at the backlog for LSAG, it's significantly above where it was last year. It's hard to peel out. There have been some longer delivery times because of logistics, but I would say the majority of it is demand-driven. It is not because it's longer delivery times. I mean, even if you took the $50 million to $55 million out -- yes. Even if you took the $50 million to $55 million out, it's still significantly higher than what it would be historically. It's a record backlog even if you take the kind of the onetime $50 million to $55 million China deferral out. Yes. It's a good question. So, it's $0.01 for Q2 beat and basically $0.01 for Q3 and Q4 with the share repurchase helping us by a couple of points, offset by FX. I would say, it's a prudent guide. Yes. Your intuition, Jack, is spot on. We didn't -- for purposes of looking at this, we looked at it more on a technology stand rather than kind of end market. But if you look at most of it actually being in China, that's where most of the impact was. And that is a market that's over-indexed to food, chemical and energy and pharma. Those were the 3 biggest markets. Environmental and forensics does have an impact there as well, but it's probably less so than the other three that I just talked about. I'll take the first one, yes. So I think if we look at what we have been able to do in Q2, it was very strong growth. it is slightly better than flattish as we've kind of tapped out -- as we're maxed out right now in capacity. But as you point out, the team continues to do a fantastic job to bring out new capacity. I will say that we do have a shutdown -- a planned shutdown in Q3 as we're doing some of the installation of Train B, which will temporarily depress the revenue there. That's built into the guide. And so, there may be a slight sequential downturn, but that's all part of the overall plan. Yes. I'll look to my colleague and Jacob, but we don't requote when we price. So we commit to the pricing at the time that the quote was valid or the order. And so, what we're seeing here is, if we take pricing in January, we just started seeing some of that flow through in the late second quarter just given the backlog. So, if we take pricing now, it's really in terms of anticipating you'll expect to see it sometime in late Q4, really into 2023. I was going to say, hey, Dan, just to build on what Sam is saying, I mean, this is really a class effect. I mean when we think about kind of the therapeutic areas and the proof of now several new products that are on the market, this is really -- you're seeing multiple big pharma and mid-cap pharma looking at therapeutic areas with this technology. And so it is really something that we're a leader in. We're building capacity aggressively. And it is really more a function of the market demand as opposed to anything from our standpoint of capacity. If we add more capacity, we'd have more revenue. Yes. We're pretty much capped on 2022. We have all the business we're able to process this year. So it's really about 2023 and beyond at this point."

And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. Our momentum continues. The Agilent team delivered a strong start to 2022 in Q1, exceeding the expectation of both the top and bottomline. Our Q1 revenues are $1.67 billion. This is up 9% core and up 8% reported. This is on top of growing 11% core in Q1 a year ago. Excluding COVID-19-related revenues, our core growth is even better at 10% this quarter. We continue to see strength in our order book with robust order intake throughout the quarter. In fact, Q1 orders grew roughly twice as fast as revenues. Q1 operating margins are a healthy 26.3%, up 80 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.21 are up 14%. The EPS increases versus a tough comparison of 31% growth in the first quarter of 2021. These strong results have been achieved in a very dynamic environment. I could not be more proud of the Agilent team\u2019s ability to execute and deliver. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of what\u2019s driving our strong results. Bob will go into more details later in the call, but our two largest markets continued strong double-digit growth. Our Pharma business, Agilent\u2019s largest market, continues to lead the way for us, growing 17%. Global end market demand for our products and services remains very strong. Biopharma grew 32% while small molecule growth came in about at a robust 9%. The momentum in our Chemical and Energy business also continues, delivering 15% growth in the quarter. This was driven by mid-teens revenue increases in Chemicals and Advanced Materials. PMIs remain positive, along with our overall outlook in the Chemicals, Energy and Advanced Materials markets. On a geographic basis, our results led by 13% growth in the Americas. This is on top of 13% growth in Q1 a year ago. China grew 3% on top of 25% growth in Q1 of last year and was impacted by the timing of Lunar New Year, as noted in our November call. Demand in China remained strong as orders grew high-teens in the first quarter. We continue to invest in China for China to further strengthen our ability to serve our customers. We recently announced a $20 million expansion of our Shanghai manufacturing center to meet growing demand for our locally made liquor chromatography, spectroscopy and mass spec systems. Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $976 million, an increase of 7% on a core basis. This is versus a 10% core growth in Q1 of 2021. LSAG\u2019s growth was led by strength in the Pharma and Chemical and Energy markets. From a platform perspective, customer interest and purchases of our chromatography systems and mass spec offerings are very robust. Our chemistries and supplies business, which moved over from ACG this year, continue to do very well, delivering double-digit growth. We also continue to invest and strategically partner for future growth. Late last week, we announced the acquisition of very exciting artificial intelligence technology that will be integrated into our industry-leading chromatography businesses. This technology has the potential to significantly improve lab growth productivity and accuracy by automating manual interpretational chromatography data. We believe that this capability will be very well received by the high throughput labs Agilent serves around the world. This acquisition is an example of our build and buy growth strategy, as a complement to work, our internal R&D teams are going to develop these types of capabilities for other Agilent platforms. During the quarter, we also announced a partnership with Lonza to integrate Agilent\u2019s analytics technologies and techniques into Lonza\u2019s Cocoon Platform cell therapy manufacturing workflow. The collaboration has the potential to transform the way personalized cell therapies are manufactured. In addition, to ensure we can meet the strong and growing demand for our cell analysis offerings, we also recently announced plans to invest more than $30 million for the construction of a new manufacturing site in Chicopee, Massachusetts. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenue of $359 million. This is up 10% core against a 11% Q1 2021 core growth compare. This growth is broad-based with strength in service contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. Our focus on providing a differentiated customer experience that leverages our large-scale and talented customer support team continues to pay off. Our connect rates continue to improve and our installed base continues to expand, both boding well for continued strength in our services business. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $339 million, up 14% core versus Q1 2021 core growth of 15%. Our excellent growth is broad-based across pathology, genomics and NASD. Our Pathology business grew roughly 10% with strength across all regions. Our core genomics business grew low-teens, with strength in target enrichment and our genomics quality control product lines. The NASD team continues to deliver, driving 45% plus growth in the quarter. Meanwhile, the additional capacity expansion at our Frederick GMP oligo manufacturing facility continues to proceed as planned. We continue to expect this capacity to come on line by the end of calendar year 2022. Our Resolution Bioscience team achieved a major milestone in the first quarter by completing the pre-market approval submission for the Resolution ctDx FIRST liquid biopsy assay as a companion diagnostic. This was done in conjunction with Mirati Therapeutics for non-small cell lung cancer and is currently under review by the FDA. It is the first of what we hope will be several indications for liquid biopsy assays. I am pleased with how we have started the year. Building on our Q1 results, continued order strength and execution prowess, we are increasing our full year financial guidance. We are raising our core growth guidance to a range of 7% to 8%, up 125 basis points at the mid-point from our prior guidance. Fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance is increased to a range of $4.80 per share to 4.90 per share, growing 11% to 13% over last year. Bob will be providing the Q2 outlook along with more detail on our improved full year guidance. We are very pleased with our Q1 results and looking forward to another strong quarter and year ahead. I am also very confident in our team and our ability to execute and deliver for our customers and shareholders, no matter what the challenge. Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to taking your questions later. However, for right now, I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob?\nBob McMahon: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue, take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I will then finish up with our improved outlook for the full year and our guidance for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike described, we posted very strong results in Q1 and exceeded expectations. Revenue was $1.6 billion -- $1.67 billion, up a reported 8.1%. Core growth was even better at 8.9% as we overcame a greater than expected negative exchange rate impact of 1.3 points, while M&A added 0.5 point to growth. Q1 core growth was 170 basis points higher than the top end of our guidance. In addition, after adjusting for the 1-point headwind due to COVID-19 revenues, our core growth outside of COVID was roughly 10%, and as Mike said, order growth was even better. Again, a very strong start to the year. Now moving to our end-market performance, our results were driven by a continuation of strong growth in Pharma, led by Biopharma, while momentum in Chemical and Energy and strong results in Diagnostics and Clinical also led the way for us in Q1. Our largest market, Pharma grew 17% during the quarter, on top of 20% growth last year. The small molecule subsegment delivered high single-digit growth, while large molecule continued its strong performance growing 32%. We are seeing our ongoing investments in biopharma paying off as demand was strong throughout the quarter. We continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the Pharma market and that our business will drive above market growth. Chemical and Energy continued to show strength, growing 15% during the quarter. Growth in Chemicals and Advanced Materials led the way, and we expect continued growth in this business.  Diagnostics and Clinical grew 11% on top of 9% growth last year, with all three business groups again expanding revenues nicely during the quarter. Our expansion of LC/MS equipment into the clinical space continues to do well. And our growth in China was particularly strong, increasing more than 30% as we continue to penetrate this market. The academia and government market was flat in Q1. The business remained resilient despite omicron impacts in the U.S. as some universities delayed in-person learning in the period following the holiday break in December and reduced lab activity in January. We have seen lab activity improve into February and believe the funding environment remains positive. The Food segment declined low-single digits against a very strong 22% growth comparison from last year. The Americas were a bright spot for us, growing in the mid-teens, while Europe was flat and China down due to difficult comparisons and Lunar New Year timing. Closing out on the performance of the markets, environmental and forensics, our smallest market was down 11%. For Agilent overall on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in Q1, led by the Americas at 13% and Europe at 6%. China grew 3% on top of 25% in Q1 last year, in addition to the effect of Lunar New Year timing, which should benefit us in Q2. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, first quarter gross margin was 56.1%, up 30 basis points from a year ago. Our team has done a good job increasing productivity and pricing has helped offset higher input and logistics costs. Operating margins of 26.3% increased 80 basis points even as we have increased our R&D investments. Our investments in digital technology for our internal operations also continue to pay off as we leverage our infrastructure across the company using our One Agilent approach. Our tax rate of 14.25% came in as expected and we had 303 million diluted shares outstanding, slightly lower than projected. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.21, up 14% versus last year after growing 31% in Q1 of fiscal 2021. We continued to produce strong operating cash flow, generating $255 million in the quarter, beating our forecast, while we also invested $75 million in capital expenditures during Q1. And during the quarter, we took advantage of market volatility to repurchase $447 million worth of shares. We also paid out $63 million in dividends, returning a combined total of $510 million to shareholders. Our balance sheet remains very healthy with a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times and given current market conditions, we expect to continue to be aggressive in deploying capital. Now, let\u2019s move on to our improved full year guidance and our outlook for the second quarter. As Mike indicated, we are raising our full year core revenue growth to an expected range of 7% to 8%, up from our initial guide in November of 5.5% to 7%. Excluding the COVID related 0.5-point headwind this year, this results in core growth of 7.5% to 8.5%. The new guidance takes into account our strong Q1 results and an improved outlook for the rest of the year on a core basis. While we have increased our core growth expectations, the dollar has strengthened considerably, doubling the estimated exchange rate headwinds from our initial guide to $110 million for the year, while the M&A impact remains relatively unchanged. Putting it all together, we are expecting full year revenues to be between $6.67 billion and $6.73 billion. In addition, we have increased our EPS guidance for the full year to $4.80 per share to $4.90 per share, up from the previous range of $4.76 per share to $4.86 per share and representing 11% to 13% growth versus fiscal year 2021. For Q2, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.595 billion to $1.625 billion. This represents core growth between 7% and 9% after adjusting for an expected 0.5-point impact related to COVID year-on-year and we expect reported growth in the range of 4.6% to 6.6%. Exchange rates are expected to have a negative impact of about 2.3% in the quarter while M&A is expected to contribute 0.3 points to growth. And closing out our Q2 guidance, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.12, up 13% to 15% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14.25% tax rate and 303 million diluted shares outstanding. Again, the Agilent team performed extremely well in Q1 and with the solid growth we are seeing in orders and the team\u2019s willingness and ability to take on every challenge that comes their way, I am confident that Q2 and our full year results will also be strong. With that, Parmeet, back to you for Q&A.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Bob. Emily, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.\nOperator: Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for the call today comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho, your line is open.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Hi. This is Rachel on for Tycho. Thanks for taking the question. So, first off, great to hear the\u2026\nMike McMullen: Hi, Rachel.\nRachel Vatnsdal: \u2026 about companion diagnostic package for FDA review. So can you just give us the expected time line for when you think you will get that back and if anything is expected in contribution for this guide for 2022?\nMike McMullen: Rachel, thanks for that question. I am going to pass it over to Sam.\nSam Raha: Yeah. Rachel, thank you very much for the question. We are very excited about having completed all the modules and made the submission for the companion diagnostic related to Mirati\u2019s adagrasib. As you know now, we have done what we need to and we will engage with the FDA as they come back with questions. We can\u2019t -- we don\u2019t exactly are able to control the time line, and as you likely know, the actual approval would be very much tied to the approval of the drug itself, which of course, we have no control over either. But we are very excited about the progress.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. I would say, Rachel\u2026\nRachel Vatnsdal: Okay. And then\u2026\nBob McMahon: \u2026to the following question.\nMike McMullen: Rachel, I think, Bob had to build on that.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Just to build on that as\u2026\nRachel Vatnsdal: Yeah.\nBob McMahon: As was recently disclosed, the PDUFA date is scheduled for the end of this fiscal -- calendar year. So there\u2019s not any material revenue associated with this built into our fiscal year guide, but we are very excited about the opportunity in 2023 and beyond.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Noted. And then, for the updated guide, can you just give us a rundown on the updated outlook by end market for what\u2019s assumed in the new guide?\nMike McMullen: For the full year or second quarter, Rachel?\nRachel Vatnsdal: Both would actually be great.\nMike McMullen: Yeah. I am going to let the witness, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. So, I think very similar to what we had talked about at the very beginning of the year. The two strongest markets will continue to be our Pharma and Chemical and Energy market. I think, as we look at those, certainly, both of them performed better than we expected in Q1 and our expectation is that, those will continue to be the driver of growth for the full year, with Pharma probably at a roughly double-digit growth and Chemical and Energy about that high single-digit, double-digit growth as well, and then, followed very closely by Diagnostics in -- at high single-digits. And then food, environmental and academia and government are probably in the low-to-mid single digits, which is pretty consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year. And it\u2019s slightly different, but same directional for Q2 with Pharma probably being a little stronger.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Got it. And then, for Chemical and Energy, can you just talk about if you see any risk coming from Russia and Ukraine, and then also, if you could just touch on that decline 11% this quarter in environmental. How much of a headwind with COVID for that segment or is there anything else underlying in that market that\u2019s really changed relative to your prior expectation?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. I would say, for Chemical and Energy, as you know, I mean, our business is really globally based. And so as of right now, we don\u2019t see any material impact to the Chemical and Energy market or our forecast going forward. Obviously, we are watching that closely. And then, I think for environmental and forensics, it\u2019s our smallest market and can be lumpy. There was some impact associated with Chinese Lunar or Lunar New Year in China. But we haven\u2019t seen any impact there. What I would say is we are starting to see some of the disbursements more in our order funnel than in revenue associated with the Infrastructure Initial Bill here in the United States. So I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it in terms of changing in fundamental demand.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMike McMullen: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Matthew Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Matthew, your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey guys. This is Dave on for Matt. It was great to see the strength in biopharma end market. It\u2019s impressive given the challenging funding market for these biotech firms. Any additional color you can give on what you are seeing in the biotech end market and productivity there?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. Dave, first of all, thanks for the recognition. We are really pleased with that 32% growth print and we see the underlying demand remaining strong. And Bob, I think, it\u2019s fair to say, we haven\u2019t release any impact at all from \u2026\nBob McMahon: No.\nMike McMullen: \u2026what maybe happened in the biotech funding arena.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. We are very excited about our portfolio and how it plays into that space and are believing that that strong growth will continue going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Fantastic. And any additional color on the drivers of the strong margin expansion in LSAG and how sustainable is this margin expansion over the rest of the year?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. I will jump in there. it -- yeah, the team has done a fantastic job really driving margin and if we look at it, it\u2019s a combination of being able to cover our costs from the standpoint of the increased logistics and material costs, as well as very strong management discipline in the operating expenses. So it\u2019s a combination of being successful in our price, which we had talked about before and covering those costs, as well as being able to leverage kind of our infrastructure across all three of the groups.\nMike McMullen: And Bob, I think, you also called out the digital investments we are making. So that\u2019s in particular showing up through the SG&A line as we leverage digital investments.\nUnidentified Analyst: Fantastic. Congrats on the quarter, guys.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Dave. Most appreciated.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter here.\nMike McMullen: Hey, Vijay.\nVijay Kumar: And thanks for taking my question.\nMike McMullen: Thank you.\nVijay Kumar: Bob, maybe one near-term question here on the second quarter guide. The 200 basis points range, that\u2019s wider than your normal -- typical range, your annual guidance range is 100 basis points, any reason for a wider branch and it comes to it really hard in 2Q. So I am curious, what\u2019s giving you the confidence to get to that upper end of 8.5%, which would imply sequentially flattish with 1Q trends?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. So let me take the second part first. As Mike mentioned in the call, our demand continues to be very strong and we actually had order growth that exceeded revenue growth almost 2x and that gives us confidence around the order book going into Q2 really across multiple end markets. And so that gives us the ability to deliver the -- or expected to deliver the high growth in Q2. In regards to the range, there are still uncertainties out there, as Omicron continues to impact, mainly Asia right now and then some other uncertainties. So I think that\u2019s just taking a little wider lens, but we still feel good about the business for the full year.\nMike McMullen: Yeah. I appreciate the recognition, I think, Bob, what we posted 19% core last year.\nBob McMahon: Yeah.\nMike McMullen: So I appreciate that recognition, Vijay. And as Bob mentioned, the book of business is really quite strong, plus also our services business is really strong Diagnostics. So the recurring revenue side of the house is quite strong.\nVijay Kumar: That\u2019s helpful, Mike. And maybe on the comment on the acquisition contribution here in the second quarter, it seems to be sequentially down. Is there any seasonality to that business and what is the guide assuming for -- you didn\u2019t note the strong order book for 2Q? Is the guide assuming perhaps the order book momentum tapers down in the back half?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. No. It doesn\u2019t. There is an element of getting tougher comps, but the momentum continues. I would say for Q2, it\u2019s more timing than anything else relative to the M&A. It is down slightly sequentially, but I would say, in the overall scheme of things, not material.\nVijay Kumar: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nMike McMullen: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Up next we have a question from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon, your line is open. \nBrandon Couillard: Hey. Good afternoon. Mike, on the\u2026\nMike McMullen: Hi, Brandon.\nBrandon Couillard: \u2026AI acquisition, it sounds interesting. It\u2019s definitely a buzzword. Would you expect to be making incremental investments with this deal and could you just comment on how and why the AI tools are kind of used in the instrumentation today and when you sort of expect this to be, I guess, more of a reality of feature?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. Brandon, happy to do so. I am going to actually invite Jacob on the response here, because, yeah, we hear a lot about the buzzwords and when the team first came to be and started talking about this opportunity, we said, well, in actuality, there\u2019s a lot more than buzzwords here. We actually have some lighthouse customers using this capability already. And as you hear from Jacob, it really drives productivity for those high volume labs. So we think for certain segments market, this is actually going to be a reality. And Jacob, why don\u2019t you, why don\u2019t you build on my comments there, if you don\u2019t mind?\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, Brandon. I am very excited about this also on bringing the best control team here into Agilent. It might be a buzzword, but we have really seen that it really makes a difference. And first of all, it fits very well into an informatic strategy, where we are all about digitalizing the lab and create that deal inside both scientifically and productivity wise for our customers. Here, the first product realization, which has already been prototype, we are aiming to what a part of the -- that is very prone for AI right now and that is really the manual interpretation of commercial graft, as Mike also mentioned. Usually, labs are spending a highly trained chemist to go out and do manual peak integration, which is tedious process. And you can imagine if you have a high volume lab, there\u2019s a lot of investment going into this area. And active virtual control here have already proven with the customers that they can take a substantial part of that work and actually automate that. So we are very glad about that. We are going after the PCMs business first. We have a substantial installed base and we actually believe that we can implement this here in the second part of fiscal 2022.  Now long-term, we do believe there\u2019s a great opportunity to provide those algorithms also across our analytical platforms and also for other applications like QC release and predictive maintenance and all things. So even though it\u2019s the buzzword, there is a lot of real products behind this and I am very excited about it. Mike?\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Jacob.\nBrandon Couillard: Thanks. Just one follow-up for Bob. Just if you could just elaborate a little bit more about the book-to-bill in the first quarter and then a couple just housekeeping, was the Lunar New Year impact kind of in line with the plan, and I think, last quarter you talked about\u2026\nBob McMahon: Yes.\nBrandon Couillard: \u2026 $15 million of kind of delayed orders, were all those recouped in the first quarter, just kind of an update on that?\nBob McMahon: Brandon, as usual, your notes are quite accurate and so let me address a couple of those things. So the Lunar New Year impact came in kind of as we anticipated, which should come back into Q2. That transit time or that $15 million that came in, but we haven\u2019t seen really the improvement. So that\u2019s still opportunities in the second half of this year. Our end of the quarter coincided with the large snowstorm in the U.S., but the shipments were out and we still were able to deliver. In terms of the first question was about Lunar.\nMike McMullen: I think on both.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Okay. I think on both. Brandon, we missed something?\nBrandon Couillard: No. Just if you quantify the book-to-bill, if you are really?\nBob McMahon: Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Quantify the book-to-bill. Yeah.\nMike McMullen: You are right.\nBob McMahon: I knew that there was something else. I was trying to avoid that one on purpose, because we are not going to provide that. But what I can tell you is that, the growth rate of our orders was twice as much as the revenue growth, and I would say, our backlog is the highest it\u2019s ever been.\nMike McMullen: And Brandon, this is Mike. I would just add one comment. There is one word in my script. I really want to make sure that I emphasize here throughout the quarter. So this wasn\u2019t just a calendar December year end kind of story. We saw this order strength throughout the entirety of our fiscal Q1.\nBrandon Couillard: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Puneet Souda from SVB Leerink. Puneet, your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, Mike and Bob. Thanks for taking the question. So, the first one is just a follow-up on the order book. I am wondering if you can quantify that, obviously, that\u2019s been growing strongly. And maybe just help us understand, once said, you have the strong order book, you have confidence in the rest of, I mean, the guide throughout the year based on what you are providing. But maybe just talk to us about the sort of the cadence wise in terms of supply chains. Obviously, we are hearing -- we have a number of questions that we get on supply chains frequently. So just wondering what\u2019s your level of confidence on the supply chain and turning those order books into orders?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. So, first of all, I\u2019d say, that the supply chain environment continues to be quite challenging. On the other hand, I remain quite confident, because our team has found ways to continue to navigate through those and meeting the expectations of customers terms to delivery times. In fact, if I recall correctly, our order cancellation was actually lower this year than prior year. So while I don\u2019t want to imply that it\u2019s all sunny out there in terms of the supply chain, we have been working on this thing for a while. I mean many quarters ago, we were working on this quarter and the second half of this year. So while the environment remains challenged externally, I remain confident in our ability to actually get product to customers when they need it.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Puneet to your first question on the quantification, we are not going to provide that other than what I had answered\u2026\nMike McMullen: Yeah. That one, Bob. But we did find the 2x order growth rate versus revenue.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Fair. And in terms of cell analysis, Mike, I mean, that franchise has been growing. You highlighted Lonza, the Cocoon platform, a couple of other capabilities. Maybe can you -- I know at one point, you had sort of quantified that business. I am wondering if you can do that again and what sort of growth rates you are seeing there and what\u2019s the expectation this year given the acceleration you are seeing in overall in biomolecules? Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Yeah. Thanks for that question. We love to talk about the cell analysis. It\u2019s been a really great addition to the company over the years and we continue to grow and expand that. So, first of all, I\u2019d say, that business remains to be very healthy. We are seeing really good strong end market demand. And Bob I think for the year, we are expecting the double-digit growth out of the cell analysis business. And really excited and the fact that, in addition to the manufacturing expansion we had in Chicopee, that kind of gives you an indication of our confidence in future growth. And I believe we are close to, Bob and Jacob, close a north of $400 million for this business?\nBob McMahon: This year.\nMike McMullen: This year. Yeah.\nBob McMahon: Forecast for this year.\nMike McMullen: Yeah.\nBob McMahon: Yeah.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Super helpful guys. All right. Thank you.\nMike McMullen: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Patrick, your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey. Thanks for the questions guys.\nMike McMullen: Hey, Patrick.\nPatrick Donnelly: Mike, maybe one on China, between the tough comp\u2026\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nPatrick Donnelly: \u2026 Lunar New Year, obviously, a few layers there. Can you just talk about, I guess, the core performance is going to stripping that out a little bit, what you are seeing there, what you saw through\u2026\nMike McMullen: Got it.\nPatrick Donnelly: \u2026 to your point there throughout the quarter, I guess, the cadence and then the expectations going forward there as well, just between the different markets there. Just curious what\u2019s going on?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. It\u2019s interesting. Sometimes you can get kind of diverted on the headlines out of China, because our business remains quite strong and we are seeing good strength in pharma has really been a key driver for us, which Bob highlighted in the script. But also our Diagnostics business, DDG grew, I think, over 40% in the first quarter, services growth in the mid-teens. So other things that I have talked to you about, which is, in addition to continuing to grow and strengthen our instrumentation portfolio market share in China. We have also been talking about our ability to grow our ACG business in China with that large installed base and the fact that we have historically viewed ourselves of being underpenetrated in Diagnostic and Genomics, and we are really starting to see traction on both of those growth factors. So, again, we feel really confident about the state of the China business, because we don\u2019t have the order book we have, but also these other areas of recurring revenue are really growing, growing well for us and we continue to invest for our customers in China, as I mentioned in my call script. So I think there\u2019s a lot to like about the opportunities in our business in China.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Patrick, just one other thing, we -- while we grew 3% as we mentioned, if we add back in kind of the Lunar New Year estimate, it was high-single digits, which was in our -- in line with what we had expected and our expectation is that, that\u2019s going to be for the full year as well. Now Q2 will be stronger than that, obviously, as it comes back and we also saw mid-teen -- mid-to-high-teens growth in orders in Q1.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just on the academic government market. You are not alone, obviously, calling that out as being a little sluggish to come back. Maybe just what you saw there in January, Mike, I know you called out the remote learning maybe caused a little more of a pause even as we go into 2022? And then just expectations there going forward, you expect the market to kind of normalize a little bit and what are you hearing from customers on that front?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. Thanks for that, Patrick. We saw -- we see the Omicron impact is transitory. We saw that in the U.S., for example, and we would expect to, I think, Bob, you called out in the script back to normal kind of levels in February. So we actually expect the environment to improve over the year. I think we are flattish for Q1. But, Bob, I think, we are calling for mid-singles or so growth for the full year. So that would imply a pickup in growth in this segment later on this year.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. I mean, for everything that we see, Patrick, funding levels continue in activity within our order book continues to be strong. So it not as strong obviously as the Pharma and C&E areas, which are leading the growth in the Diagnostics, but we are not seeing any fundamentally different performance in that market going forward.\nPatrick Donnelly: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys.\nMike McMullen: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Up next we have a question from Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Jack, your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon, Jack.\nJack Meehan: I was hoping you could elaborate on the pricing actions you are taking in the market? How do they compare to kind of normal periods and what areas of the portfolio have you had success when it comes to pricing?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. I will take that, Jack. And I think we mentioned at the beginning of the year that we were estimating roughly a point of growth associated with that was about half of what we had seen normally to cover the increased costs, and what I would say is, through Q1 we are ahead of schedule, which is good.\nJack Meehan: Okay. And then, the other area I was hoping you had an update on is NASD, so over 45% growth in the quarter. Maybe just any update to what your guidance is for the full year? It seems like you are tracking ahead of schedule here and just when the new line opens up, just what sort of pace you expect to be able to take advantage of that capacity?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. I was going to say, we -- the team continues to do a fantastic job and continues to drive even more revenue and product out of the existing capacity and it was a great first quarter and slightly ahead of our expectations. We had expected double-digit growth and that continues to be our expectation before the new train, Train B comes online at the end of this calendar year. And the order book continues to be strong. That team continues to actually build the order book for 2023 and building that demand for that train. So we are extremely excited about that business and are looking forward to not only bringing that up, but also looking for other ways to expand our capacity.\nMike McMullen: Absolutely.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Derik, please go ahead.\nMike Ryskin: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. This is Mike on for Derik.\nMike McMullen: Hi, Mike.\nMike Ryskin: I want to ask a little bit on the -- hey -- I want to ask a little bit on the Diagnostics and the Clinical end markets. In particular, you called out sort of the expansion of our CNS [ph] into some of the applications here and you are seeing a new vector of clinical growth here. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. Just sort of what are the specific drivers you are seeing there and where some of that uptick happening.\nMike McMullen: Yeah. I am going to pass it over to Jacob for some more details here. But also I would also just remind, we also had a very good print on the pathology side of our Diagnostics business. But I think you will hear from, Jacob, LC/MS is an indication of some future traction, we are already getting some good growth. So, Jacob, your thoughts there?\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah. Absolutely. We have closed the year have a good LC/MS Clinical business in U.S. But over the past year, we have also expanded ourselves into China, really good tractions. We both have our own product line there, our direct sales, but we also have an OEM partner. So in that sense we are both addressing the customers that we know, but also a lot of customers that we want to get access to. And that\u2019s been quite successful and hence we are right now looking to expand the portfolio even further. We have the Ultivo, of course, with our LC connected and we are looking to other parts of our portfolio, both within LC/MS, but also beyond LC/MS here over the next period of time. But we do see China as a great opportunity, but here over the next over time, we will also enter into other areas like Europe and other places.\nMike McMullen: And Jacob, on the Ultivo, what I think the customers love the combination of performance and the size of the footprint really fits nicely into the diagnostic lab.\nJacob Thaysen: Yeah. Exactly. We spent a lot of energy of both making it a size that fits very well into the LC stack. But more than that we also made it more easy to work with. So it\u2019s actually an ease-of-use solution. So we are very excited about that and even better the customers are also super excited about that. I do want to mention also that we also have a strong Clinical business within the flow cytometry. With the Ultivo business that continues to drive growth and particularly China, where we see a lot of demand there also. As you might recall, the flow cytometry from the LC business is really focused on decentralized lab also again with ease-of-use and we see a lot of interest in that. And I do expect also that U.S. will be a future market for us here.\nMike Ryskin: Great. I appreciate that. Any color you can give us just real quick on sort of how meaningful LC/MS is within that 15% of your exposure? Is it just to give us a sense of the scale of that relative to genomics and cancer diagnostics and pathology things like that?\nMike McMullen: Bob, do you want to take it or do you want me to?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Yeah. I will take it. It is still relatively small but growing very fast, which the market itself is quite large and so the opportunity here is really in front of us going forward.\nMike Ryskin: Great. And if I could ask a quick follow-up on -- just on the capital deployment side\u2026\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nMike Ryskin: \u2026 and on M&A. Obviously, you have done some smaller deals in the last couple of years and you continue to invest in new technologies and you have got some, you have had M&A deployed into sort of Life Science Solutions and cell analysis. You have had things in liquid biopsy and now artificial intelligence. So it\u2019s kind of showcase that you can deploy capital in a variety of different markets. But just looking at where the balance sheet is now, any thought on larger acquisitions and sort of scaling up to do a bigger deal? And what excites you, what markets would you be looking to? What\u2019s -- so how would you go about starting to deploy that capital?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. Sure. Happy to address that, Mike. So I appreciate, by the way, the recognition of the variety of where we deploy capital. But there\u2019s a consistent theme across where we deploy capital, which is high growth end markets, which will drive increase to the overall core growth of the company in places where we can leverage the scale and the capabilities we have in the company to really make those businesses even more successful. So I think there\u2019s a timing kind of an underlying theme behind all those acquisitions. So that would continue to be our thesis and our approach, as well as staying focused in the private sector, which we think there\u2019s -- really fits well the Agilent model and often the potential acquired companies and leadership teams really find the Agilent culture, a good place to be and they also see how well we have done with previous acquisitions. So we have got a track record as well that they can point to. And I am on record saying that, we wanted to deploy our balance sheet as part of our overall growth story. It\u2019s part of what we have been calling our build and buy growth strategy. And as you may know, the largest deal that we have done to date has been -- was the acquisition of BioTek, but we believe we can do multiples of that deal and be willing to deploy capital if the right opportunity comes along for us.\nMike Ryskin: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Thomas Peterson from Baird. Thomas, your line is open.\nThomas Peterson: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nThomas Peterson: Just wanted to circle back on Pharma and just wanted to know if you had seen any benefit within Pharma from both onshoring activities and manufacturing redundancies and kind of, if so, where has this tailwind been and what are your expectations for any potential durability here?\nMike McMullen: Great question. So I think this is actually a story both for the Pharma, as well as elements of our Chemical and Energy business. And I\u2019d say right now, not yet material in terms of order book or revenue, but we believe it\u2019s coming.  There\u2019s a lot of discussions with customers that are building new capacity. I would say it\u2019s probably more of a 2023 kind of event. But I think it speaks to the durability of growth that we think we have in Agilent\u2019s two largest end markets. So we are hearing lots of discussions about dual sources of critical components, onshoring of previously offshore critical supply chain elements. So I think the continued supply chain challenges that the world is seeing is only putting more emphasis on that direction. So I\u2019d say right now, it\u2019s in the longer term planning phase. As you know, the analytical laboratory instrumentation is often the last thing that\u2019s added when they bring on new capacity, but we believe it\u2019s coming, but it\u2019s not been material yet to the company\u2019s performance.\nThomas Peterson: Great. That\u2019s super helpful. And maybe just to finish for me, just any updated thoughts on the One Agilent commercial organization transition? Anything that surprised you relative to expectations, sort of how is that incorporation gone internally?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. So I am going to have Padraig jump in here with some additional specifics. As you know, I have asked Padraig to take on this role in addition to his leading the overall Agilent Services business. But we are just delighted with the start of this new structure and I think I always say the proofs in the results and we are off to a good start with the fact that we had such a strong Q1 order book throughout the quarter. And Padraig, I know it\u2019s been just a few months where you have been pulling your team together and but I think you are already starting to work with customers differently and maybe you could share some of your thoughts here.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I think we are starting to see the benefit of an enterprise approach to both sales and service, and the associated functions, and of course, selling the complete Agilent solution to customers, which includes instruments, services and consumers with aligned sales approach is really giving us a lot of scale with customers. We are also seeing a doubling down on our investment in our digital interaction with customers and we continue to see strong momentum with accelerating digital growth of about 25%. So great start, Mike, and more to come.\nThomas Peterson: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Brennan from Cowen. Dan, your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Hey, Mike and Bob, thanks for taking the questions. Congrats.\nMike McMullen: Sure, Dan.\nDan Brennan: I was hoping to go back to C&E, Mike, could you or Bob...\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nDan Brennan: \u2026unpack -- kind of unpack the customers there, Chemical R&M, can you just kind of give us a flavor for what you are seeing? I know the question was asked earlier about the impact of what\u2019s going on. But just wondering, as oil price spikes in the past, kind of what kind of impact have you seen if the oil price spike is sustained?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. I\u2019d say if you look at the three sub-segments of the C&E marketplace, we often talk about the Chemicals, Energy and Advanced Materials market. I think it\u2019s the Chemicals and Advanced Materials market segments that are driving the growth here. Now theoretically, when -- although, be it now much -- it\u2019s a very small part of the total number these days, higher oil prices would tend to lead to more investment in that Energy segment portion of the whole market segment. But I can\u2019t remember the exact percentage. I know it\u2019s evolved a bit over time. But I think what\u2019s most interest to us is how does the world view global growth were PMI. So, yes, I think, the highest correlation of growth in this segment relate to PMI and the global growth outlook. But we would -- there could be some more money to invest in exploration, perhaps, if oil prices stay high, but it\u2019s really also really driven by the PMI view. That\u2019s why they still remain positive and that\u2019s why we are optimistic about our ability to grow this overall market throughout the rest of this year.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Dan, to build on what Mike was saying, if we looked at those three big areas, over 90% or roughly 90% of our C&E business is actually Chemicals and Advanced Materials. And so the Energy piece is an important component, but that demand around new types of Chemicals, Advanced Materials and so forth is really what\u2019s driving it\u2026\nMike McMullen: Yeah.\nBob McMahon: And so whether it be batteries and other areas around these is the growth driver today.\nDan Brennan: Got it. Thanks guys. And then, just related to the Oligo business the MAC business, just can you remind us, at least from the perspective of like basin within your high single-digit growth for Pharma, kind of how many points of growth should we be thinking that business is contributing?\nBob McMahon: From Pharma, it grew -- it was roughly 2 points to 3 points of growth for pharma in Q1.\nDan Brennan: And then, for the year, sorry? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about that, I misspoke. So for the year, I think you are talking low double now for Pharma. So what\u2019s assumed from the Oligo business\u2026\nBob McMahon: Yeah.\nDan Brennan: \u2026within that [inaudible] demo?\nBob McMahon: A point or two.\nMike McMullen: Yeah. I think the\u2026\nDan Brennan: Very clear.\nMike McMullen: \u2026 message here is the, yeah, the Pharma growth was strong for the biopharma, NASD, but also across the rest of the company\u2019s portfolio as well.\nDan Brennan: Yeah.\nMike McMullen: So it\u2019s an Agilent wide story.\nDan Brennan: Yeah. Great. And then maybe just one final one to sneak in just the LC market, Mike, it\u2019s always entering here, what\u2019s going on\u2026\nMike McMullen: Yeah.\nDan Brennan: \u2026 and that\u2019s a big part of your business, what the competitive trends there like in LC?\nMike McMullen: All I can tell you about is what\u2019s going on in my business, which is its doing very well. So we have got -- we had -- we continue to see very strong business momentum. The market demand is very robust. You may have recall in my script, I tried to call out demand in our chromatography systems remains very robust. We saw double-digit growth again in Q2 -- Q1 2022 off double-digit or the prior year, backlog strong, orders growing faster than revenue. So there\u2019s a lot to like about what\u2019s going on with the LC business.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thank you guys.\nMike McMullen: You are very welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Paul Knight from KeyBanc. Paul, please go ahead.\nPaul Knight: It\u2019s always tough to ask a good question late in the day, Mike.\nMike McMullen: Come on, Paul. I know you are up to it. I know you are up to it.\nPaul Knight: As I look at the 32% biotechnology growth, which seems extraordinarily good, would you attribute this to the cell and gene therapy market, and what specifically biotech instruments? What\u2019s behind that really high growth rate?\nMike McMullen: Bob, why don\u2019t we tag team on this, but I\u2019d say, it\u2019s really being driven by not only the NASD business we talked about earlier, but our core LC/MS business. I mean there is some contribution from cell and gene therapy, but it really is coming from the LC/MS business along with really strong growth of services and consumables as well. So, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s really a broad-based story, but really around our core instrumentation platforms along with services and consumables.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Spot on.\nMike McMullen: I mean, goes for that.\nPaul Knight: Okay. Sorry, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Go ahead, Paul. Sorry.\nPaul Knight: You have mentioned LC/MS more than, I think, is typical. Is this a result of -- are you seeing a result of benefit yet from the Avantor JV. And in addition, I know CrossLab, you mentioned higher connectivity. I think you are implying you continue to gain some share there, if you can talk to those two topics?\nMike McMullen: Yeah. Sure. Happy to do. ACG has been what we are doing has been near and dear to our overall growth strategy for a number of years and we are very excited about the new relationship we have with Avantor. I\u2019d say it\u2019s still very early days, so not yet a material contributor to the topline revenue and that really was all according -- so it\u2019s proceeding according to plan. So I\u2019d say there\u2019s more to come in that regard. And then on the connect rate, yeah, in fact, we called that out on purpose to say, we continue to see higher connect rates with our consumables and services business, and we think that bodes well for future growth. And Padraig, maybe you want to just comment a bit on what you are seeing on the services side and the connect rate.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Well, overall, the attach rate for both service and consumables in the high 20s, but we believe and we have significant headroom for growth going forward as we target into higher technology spaces. And on the services side, in particular, we have a strong demand for contracts and that\u2019s driving a lot of connect rate with new instruments as well, Mike.\nMike McMullen: Yeah. I think we had double-digit contract growth and probably more than 10% of Agilent\u2019s revenues now in -- under service contracts.\nPaul Knight: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Those are all the questions we have time for today. So I will now hand back to Parmeet to conclude today\u2019s call.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Emily, and thanks everyone for joining. With that, we would like to wrap up the call for today. Have a great rest of the day everyone.\nOperator: Thank you everyone for joining our call today. This now concludes our call. Please disconnect your lines.",

We are very excited about having completed all the modules and made the submission for the companion diagnostic related to Mirati\u2019s adagrasib. As you know now, we have done what we need to and we will engage with the FDA as they come back with questions. We can\u2019t -- we don\u2019t exactly are able to control the time line, and as you likely know, the actual approval would be very much tied to the approval of the drug itself, which of course, we have no control over either. But we are very excited about the progress."

            "content": "Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question, Brandon. I am very excited about this also on bringing the best control team here into Agilent. It might be a buzzword, but we have really seen that it really makes a difference. And first of all, it fits very well into an informatic strategy, where we are all about digitalizing the lab and create that deal inside both scientifically and productivity wise for our customers. Here, the first product realization, which has already been prototype, we are aiming to what a part of the -- that is very prone for AI right now and that is really the manual interpretation of commercial graft, as Mike also mentioned. Usually, labs are spending a highly trained chemist to go out and do manual peak integration, which is tedious process. And you can imagine if you have a high volume lab, there\u2019s a lot of investment going into this area. And active virtual control here have already proven with the customers that they can take a substantial part of that work and actually automate that. So we are very glad about that. We are going after the PCMs business first. We have a substantial installed base and we actually believe that we can implement this here in the second part of fiscal 2022.  Now long-term, we do believe there\u2019s a great opportunity to provide those algorithms also across our analytical platforms and also for other applications like QC release and predictive maintenance and all things. So even though it\u2019s the buzzword, there is a lot of real products behind this and I am very excited about it. Mike? Yeah. Absolutely. We have closed the year have a good LC/MS Clinical business in U.S. But over the past year, we have also expanded ourselves into China, really good tractions. We both have our own product line there, our direct sales, but we also have an OEM partner. So in that sense we are both addressing the customers that we know, but also a lot of customers that we want to get access to. And that\u2019s been quite successful and hence we are right now looking to expand the portfolio even further. We have the Ultivo, of course, with our LC connected and we are looking to other parts of our portfolio, both within LC/MS, but also beyond LC/MS here over the next period of time. But we do see China as a great opportunity, but here over the next over time, we will also enter into other areas like Europe and other places. Yeah. Exactly. We spent a lot of energy of both making it a size that fits very well into the LC stack. But more than that we also made it more easy to work with. So it\u2019s actually an ease-of-use solution.

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks everyone for joining our call today. Our momentum continues. The Agilent team delivered a strong start to 2022 in Q1, exceeding the expectation of both the top and bottomline. Our Q1 revenues are $1.67 billion. This is up 9% core and up 8% reported. This is on top of growing 11% core in Q1 a year ago. Excluding COVID-19-related revenues, our core growth is even better at 10% this quarter. We continue to see strength in our order book with robust order intake throughout the quarter. In fact, Q1 orders grew roughly twice as fast as revenues. Q1 operating margins are a healthy 26.3%, up 80 basis points from last year. Earnings per share of $1.21 are up 14%. The EPS increases versus a tough comparison of 31% growth in the first quarter of 2021. These strong results have been achieved in a very dynamic environment. I could not be more proud of the Agilent team\u2019s ability to execute and deliver. Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of what\u2019s driving our strong results. Bob will go into more details later in the call, but our two largest markets continued strong double-digit growth. Our Pharma business, Agilent\u2019s largest market, continues to lead the way for us, growing 17%. Global end market demand for our products and services remains very strong. Biopharma grew 32% while small molecule growth came in about at a robust 9%. The momentum in our Chemical and Energy business also continues, delivering 15% growth in the quarter. This was driven by mid-teens revenue increases in Chemicals and Advanced Materials. PMIs remain positive, along with our overall outlook in the Chemicals, Energy and Advanced Materials markets. On a geographic basis, our results led by 13% growth in the Americas. This is on top of 13% growth in Q1 a year ago. China grew 3% on top of 25% growth in Q1 of last year and was impacted by the timing of Lunar New Year, as noted in our November call. Demand in China remained strong as orders grew high-teens in the first quarter. We continue to invest in China for China to further strengthen our ability to serve our customers. We recently announced a $20 million expansion of our Shanghai manufacturing center to meet growing demand for our locally made liquor chromatography, spectroscopy and mass spec systems. Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Science and Applied Markets Group generated revenue of $976 million, an increase of 7% on a core basis. This is versus a 10% core growth in Q1 of 2021. LSAG\u2019s growth was led by strength in the Pharma and Chemical and Energy markets. From a platform perspective, customer interest and purchases of our chromatography systems and mass spec offerings are very robust. Our chemistries and supplies business, which moved over from ACG this year, continue to do very well, delivering double-digit growth. We also continue to invest and strategically partner for future growth. Late last week, we announced the acquisition of very exciting artificial intelligence technology that will be integrated into our industry-leading chromatography businesses. This technology has the potential to significantly improve lab growth productivity and accuracy by automating manual interpretational chromatography data. We believe that this capability will be very well received by the high throughput labs Agilent serves around the world. This acquisition is an example of our build and buy growth strategy, as a complement to work, our internal R&D teams are going to develop these types of capabilities for other Agilent platforms. During the quarter, we also announced a partnership with Lonza to integrate Agilent\u2019s analytics technologies and techniques into Lonza\u2019s Cocoon Platform cell therapy manufacturing workflow. The collaboration has the potential to transform the way personalized cell therapies are manufactured. In addition, to ensure we can meet the strong and growing demand for our cell analysis offerings, we also recently announced plans to invest more than $30 million for the construction of a new manufacturing site in Chicopee, Massachusetts. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted services revenue of $359 million. This is up 10% core against a 11% Q1 2021 core growth compare. This growth is broad-based with strength in service contracts, preventive maintenance, compliance, education and informatic enterprise services. Our focus on providing a differentiated customer experience that leverages our large-scale and talented customer support team continues to pay off. Our connect rates continue to improve and our installed base continues to expand, both boding well for continued strength in our services business. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $339 million, up 14% core versus Q1 2021 core growth of 15%. Our excellent growth is broad-based across pathology, genomics and NASD. Our Pathology business grew roughly 10% with strength across all regions. Our core genomics business grew low-teens, with strength in target enrichment and our genomics quality control product lines. The NASD team continues to deliver, driving 45% plus growth in the quarter. Meanwhile, the additional capacity expansion at our Frederick GMP oligo manufacturing facility continues to proceed as planned. We continue to expect this capacity to come on line by the end of calendar year 2022. Our Resolution Bioscience team achieved a major milestone in the first quarter by completing the pre-market approval submission for the Resolution ctDx FIRST liquid biopsy assay as a companion diagnostic. This was done in conjunction with Mirati Therapeutics for non-small cell lung cancer and is currently under review by the FDA. It is the first of what we hope will be several indications for liquid biopsy assays. I am pleased with how we have started the year. Building on our Q1 results, continued order strength and execution prowess, we are increasing our full year financial guidance. We are raising our core growth guidance to a range of 7% to 8%, up 125 basis points at the mid-point from our prior guidance. Fiscal year 2022 non-GAAP EPS guidance is increased to a range of $4.80 per share to 4.90 per share, growing 11% to 13% over last year. Bob will be providing the Q2 outlook along with more detail on our improved full year guidance. We are very pleased with our Q1 results and looking forward to another strong quarter and year ahead. I am also very confident in our team and our ability to execute and deliver for our customers and shareholders, no matter what the challenge. Thank you for being on the call today and I look forward to taking your questions later. However, for right now, I will now hand the call off to Bob. Bob? Hi, Rachel. Rachel, thanks for that question. I am going to pass it over to Sam. Rachel, I think, Bob had to build on that. For the full year or second quarter, Rachel? Yeah. I am going to let the witness, Bob. Yeah. I would say, for Chemical and Energy, as you know, I mean, our business is really globally based. And so as of right now, we don\u2019t see any material impact to the Chemical and Energy market or our forecast going forward. Obviously, we are watching that closely. And then, I think for environmental and forensics, it\u2019s our smallest market and can be lumpy. There was some impact associated with Chinese Lunar or Lunar New Year in China. But we haven\u2019t seen any impact there. What I would say is we are starting to see some of the disbursements more in our order funnel than in revenue associated with the Infrastructure Initial Bill here in the United States. So I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it in terms of changing in fundamental demand. You are very welcome. Yeah. Dave, first of all, thanks for the recognition. We are really pleased with that 32% growth print and we see the underlying demand remaining strong. And Bob, I think, it\u2019s fair to say, we haven\u2019t release any impact at all from \u2026 \u2026what maybe happened in the biotech funding arena. And Bob, I think, you also called out the digital investments we are making. So that\u2019s in particular showing up through the SG&A line as we leverage digital investments. Thanks, Dave. Most appreciated. Hey, Vijay. Thank you. Yeah. I appreciate the recognition, I think, Bob, what we posted 19% core last year. So I appreciate that recognition, Vijay. And as Bob mentioned, the book of business is really quite strong, plus also our services business is really strong Diagnostics. So the recurring revenue side of the house is quite strong. You are very welcome. Hi, Brandon. Yeah. Brandon, happy to do so. I am going to actually invite Jacob on the response here, because, yeah, we hear a lot about the buzzwords and when the team first came to be and started talking about this opportunity, we said, well, in actuality, there\u2019s a lot more than buzzwords here. We actually have some lighthouse customers using this capability already. And as you hear from Jacob, it really drives productivity for those high volume labs. So we think for certain segments market, this is actually going to be a reality. And Jacob, why don\u2019t you, why don\u2019t you build on my comments there, if you don\u2019t mind? Thanks, Jacob. I think on both. You are right. And Brandon, this is Mike. I would just add one comment. There is one word in my script. I really want to make sure that I emphasize here throughout the quarter. So this wasn\u2019t just a calendar December year end kind of story. We saw this order strength throughout the entirety of our fiscal Q1. Yeah. So, first of all, I\u2019d say, that the supply chain environment continues to be quite challenging. On the other hand, I remain quite confident, because our team has found ways to continue to navigate through those and meeting the expectations of customers terms to delivery times. In fact, if I recall correctly, our order cancellation was actually lower this year than prior year. So while I don\u2019t want to imply that it\u2019s all sunny out there in terms of the supply chain, we have been working on this thing for a while. I mean many quarters ago, we were working on this quarter and the second half of this year. So while the environment remains challenged externally, I remain confident in our ability to actually get product to customers when they need it. Yeah. That one, Bob. But we did find the 2x order growth rate versus revenue. Yeah. Thanks for that question. We love to talk about the cell analysis. It\u2019s been a really great addition to the company over the years and we continue to grow and expand that. So, first of all, I\u2019d say, that business remains to be very healthy. We are seeing really good strong end market demand. And Bob I think for the year, we are expecting the double-digit growth out of the cell analysis business. And really excited and the fact that, in addition to the manufacturing expansion we had in Chicopee, that kind of gives you an indication of our confidence in future growth. And I believe we are close to, Bob and Jacob, close a north of $400 million for this business? This year. Yeah. Yeah. You are very welcome. Hey, Patrick. Sure. Got it. Yeah. It\u2019s interesting. Sometimes you can get kind of diverted on the headlines out of China, because our business remains quite strong and we are seeing good strength in pharma has really been a key driver for us, which Bob highlighted in the script. But also our Diagnostics business, DDG grew, I think, over 40% in the first quarter, services growth in the mid-teens. So other things that I have talked to you about, which is, in addition to continuing to grow and strengthen our instrumentation portfolio market share in China. We have also been talking about our ability to grow our ACG business in China with that large installed base and the fact that we have historically viewed ourselves of being underpenetrated in Diagnostic and Genomics, and we are really starting to see traction on both of those growth factors. So, again, we feel really confident about the state of the China business, because we don\u2019t have the order book we have, but also these other areas of recurring revenue are really growing, growing well for us and we continue to invest for our customers in China, as I mentioned in my call script. So I think there\u2019s a lot to like about the opportunities in our business in China. Yeah. Thanks for that, Patrick. We saw -- we see the Omicron impact is transitory. We saw that in the U.S., for example, and we would expect to, I think, Bob, you called out in the script back to normal kind of levels in February. So we actually expect the environment to improve over the year. I think we are flattish for Q1. But, Bob, I think, we are calling for mid-singles or so growth for the full year. So that would imply a pickup in growth in this segment later on this year. You are very welcome. Good afternoon, Jack. Absolutely. Hi, Mike. Yeah. I am going to pass it over to Jacob for some more details here. But also I would also just remind, we also had a very good print on the pathology side of our Diagnostics business. But I think you will hear from, Jacob, LC/MS is an indication of some future traction, we are already getting some good growth. So, Jacob, your thoughts there? And Jacob, on the Ultivo, what I think the customers love the combination of performance and the size of the footprint really fits nicely into the diagnostic lab. Bob, do you want to take it or do you want me to? Sure. Yeah. Sure. Happy to address that, Mike. So I appreciate, by the way, the recognition of the variety of where we deploy capital. But there\u2019s a consistent theme across where we deploy capital, which is high growth end markets, which will drive increase to the overall core growth of the company in places where we can leverage the scale and the capabilities we have in the company to really make those businesses even more successful. So I think there\u2019s a timing kind of an underlying theme behind all those acquisitions. So that would continue to be our thesis and our approach, as well as staying focused in the private sector, which we think there\u2019s -- really fits well the Agilent model and often the potential acquired companies and leadership teams really find the Agilent culture, a good place to be and they also see how well we have done with previous acquisitions. So we have got a track record as well that they can point to. And I am on record saying that, we wanted to deploy our balance sheet as part of our overall growth story. It\u2019s part of what we have been calling our build and buy growth strategy. And as you may know, the largest deal that we have done to date has been -- was the acquisition of BioTek, but we believe we can do multiples of that deal and be willing to deploy capital if the right opportunity comes along for us. Sure. Great question. So I think this is actually a story both for the Pharma, as well as elements of our Chemical and Energy business. And I\u2019d say right now, not yet material in terms of order book or revenue, but we believe it\u2019s coming.  There\u2019s a lot of discussions with customers that are building new capacity. I would say it\u2019s probably more of a 2023 kind of event. But I think it speaks to the durability of growth that we think we have in Agilent\u2019s two largest end markets. So we are hearing lots of discussions about dual sources of critical components, onshoring of previously offshore critical supply chain elements. So I think the continued supply chain challenges that the world is seeing is only putting more emphasis on that direction. So I\u2019d say right now, it\u2019s in the longer term planning phase. As you know, the analytical laboratory instrumentation is often the last thing that\u2019s added when they bring on new capacity, but we believe it\u2019s coming, but it\u2019s not been material yet to the company\u2019s performance. Yeah. So I am going to have Padraig jump in here with some additional specifics. As you know, I have asked Padraig to take on this role in addition to his leading the overall Agilent Services business. But we are just delighted with the start of this new structure and I think I always say the proofs in the results and we are off to a good start with the fact that we had such a strong Q1 order book throughout the quarter. And Padraig, I know it\u2019s been just a few months where you have been pulling your team together and but I think you are already starting to work with customers differently and maybe you could share some of your thoughts here. Sure, Dan. Sure. Yeah. I\u2019d say if you look at the three sub-segments of the C&E marketplace, we often talk about the Chemicals, Energy and Advanced Materials market. I think it\u2019s the Chemicals and Advanced Materials market segments that are driving the growth here. Now theoretically, when -- although, be it now much -- it\u2019s a very small part of the total number these days, higher oil prices would tend to lead to more investment in that Energy segment portion of the whole market segment. But I can\u2019t remember the exact percentage. I know it\u2019s evolved a bit over time. But I think what\u2019s most interest to us is how does the world view global growth were PMI. So, yes, I think, the highest correlation of growth in this segment relate to PMI and the global growth outlook. But we would -- there could be some more money to invest in exploration, perhaps, if oil prices stay high, but it\u2019s really also really driven by the PMI view. That\u2019s why they still remain positive and that\u2019s why we are optimistic about our ability to grow this overall market throughout the rest of this year. Yeah. Yeah. I think the\u2026 \u2026 message here is the, yeah, the Pharma growth was strong for the biopharma, NASD, but also across the rest of the company\u2019s portfolio as well. So it\u2019s an Agilent wide story. Yeah. All I can tell you about is what\u2019s going on in my business, which is its doing very well. So we have got -- we had -- we continue to see very strong business momentum. The market demand is very robust. You may have recall in my script, I tried to call out demand in our chromatography systems remains very robust. We saw double-digit growth again in Q2 -- Q1 2022 off double-digit or the prior year, backlog strong, orders growing faster than revenue. So there\u2019s a lot to like about what\u2019s going on with the LC business. You are very welcome. Come on, Paul. I know you are up to it. I know you are up to it. Bob, why don\u2019t we tag team on this, but I\u2019d say, it\u2019s really being driven by not only the NASD business we talked about earlier, but our core LC/MS business. I mean there is some contribution from cell and gene therapy, but it really is coming from the LC/MS business along with really strong growth of services and consumables as well. So, I\u2019d say, it\u2019s really a broad-based story, but really around our core instrumentation platforms along with services and consumables. I mean, goes for that. Yeah. Sure. Happy to do. ACG has been what we are doing has been near and dear to our overall growth strategy for a number of years and we are very excited about the new relationship we have with Avantor. I\u2019d say it\u2019s still very early days, so not yet a material contributor to the topline revenue and that really was all according -- so it\u2019s proceeding according to plan. So I\u2019d say there\u2019s more to come in that regard. And then on the connect rate, yeah, in fact, we called that out on purpose to say, we continue to see higher connect rates with our consumables and services business, and we think that bodes well for future growth. And Padraig, maybe you want to just comment a bit on what you are seeing on the services side and the connect rate. Yeah. I think we had double-digit contract growth and probably more than 10% of Agilent\u2019s revenues now in -- under service contracts."

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue, take you through the income statement and some other key financial metrics. I will then finish up with our improved outlook for the full year and our guidance for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Mike described, we posted very strong results in Q1 and exceeded expectations. Revenue was $1.6 billion -- $1.67 billion, up a reported 8.1%. Core growth was even better at 8.9% as we overcame a greater than expected negative exchange rate impact of 1.3 points, while M&A added 0.5 point to growth. Q1 core growth was 170 basis points higher than the top end of our guidance. In addition, after adjusting for the 1-point headwind due to COVID-19 revenues, our core growth outside of COVID was roughly 10%, and as Mike said, order growth was even better. Again, a very strong start to the year. Now moving to our end-market performance, our results were driven by a continuation of strong growth in Pharma, led by Biopharma, while momentum in Chemical and Energy and strong results in Diagnostics and Clinical also led the way for us in Q1. Our largest market, Pharma grew 17% during the quarter, on top of 20% growth last year. The small molecule subsegment delivered high single-digit growth, while large molecule continued its strong performance growing 32%. We are seeing our ongoing investments in biopharma paying off as demand was strong throughout the quarter. We continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the Pharma market and that our business will drive above market growth. Chemical and Energy continued to show strength, growing 15% during the quarter. Growth in Chemicals and Advanced Materials led the way, and we expect continued growth in this business.  Diagnostics and Clinical grew 11% on top of 9% growth last year, with all three business groups again expanding revenues nicely during the quarter. Our expansion of LC/MS equipment into the clinical space continues to do well. And our growth in China was particularly strong, increasing more than 30% as we continue to penetrate this market. The academia and government market was flat in Q1. The business remained resilient despite omicron impacts in the U.S. as some universities delayed in-person learning in the period following the holiday break in December and reduced lab activity in January. We have seen lab activity improve into February and believe the funding environment remains positive. The Food segment declined low-single digits against a very strong 22% growth comparison from last year. The Americas were a bright spot for us, growing in the mid-teens, while Europe was flat and China down due to difficult comparisons and Lunar New Year timing. Closing out on the performance of the markets, environmental and forensics, our smallest market was down 11%. For Agilent overall on a geographic basis, all regions again grew in Q1, led by the Americas at 13% and Europe at 6%. China grew 3% on top of 25% in Q1 last year, in addition to the effect of Lunar New Year timing, which should benefit us in Q2. Now turning to the rest of the P&L, first quarter gross margin was 56.1%, up 30 basis points from a year ago. Our team has done a good job increasing productivity and pricing has helped offset higher input and logistics costs. Operating margins of 26.3% increased 80 basis points even as we have increased our R&D investments. Our investments in digital technology for our internal operations also continue to pay off as we leverage our infrastructure across the company using our One Agilent approach. Our tax rate of 14.25% came in as expected and we had 303 million diluted shares outstanding, slightly lower than projected. Putting it all together, we delivered EPS of $1.21, up 14% versus last year after growing 31% in Q1 of fiscal 2021. We continued to produce strong operating cash flow, generating $255 million in the quarter, beating our forecast, while we also invested $75 million in capital expenditures during Q1. And during the quarter, we took advantage of market volatility to repurchase $447 million worth of shares. We also paid out $63 million in dividends, returning a combined total of $510 million to shareholders. Our balance sheet remains very healthy with a net leverage ratio of 0.9 times and given current market conditions, we expect to continue to be aggressive in deploying capital. Now, let\u2019s move on to our improved full year guidance and our outlook for the second quarter. As Mike indicated, we are raising our full year core revenue growth to an expected range of 7% to 8%, up from our initial guide in November of 5.5% to 7%. Excluding the COVID related 0.5-point headwind this year, this results in core growth of 7.5% to 8.5%. The new guidance takes into account our strong Q1 results and an improved outlook for the rest of the year on a core basis. While we have increased our core growth expectations, the dollar has strengthened considerably, doubling the estimated exchange rate headwinds from our initial guide to $110 million for the year, while the M&A impact remains relatively unchanged. Putting it all together, we are expecting full year revenues to be between $6.67 billion and $6.73 billion. In addition, we have increased our EPS guidance for the full year to $4.80 per share to $4.90 per share, up from the previous range of $4.76 per share to $4.86 per share and representing 11% to 13% growth versus fiscal year 2021. For Q2, we are expecting revenue to range from $1.595 billion to $1.625 billion. This represents core growth between 7% and 9% after adjusting for an expected 0.5-point impact related to COVID year-on-year and we expect reported growth in the range of 4.6% to 6.6%. Exchange rates are expected to have a negative impact of about 2.3% in the quarter while M&A is expected to contribute 0.3 points to growth. And closing out our Q2 guidance, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.10 to $1.12, up 13% to 15% versus the prior year. This is based on a 14.25% tax rate and 303 million diluted shares outstanding. Again, the Agilent team performed extremely well in Q1 and with the solid growth we are seeing in orders and the team\u2019s willingness and ability to take on every challenge that comes their way, I am confident that Q2 and our full year results will also be strong. With that, Parmeet, back to you for Q&A. Yeah. I would say, Rachel\u2026 \u2026to the following question. Yeah. Just to build on that as\u2026 As was recently disclosed, the PDUFA date is scheduled for the end of this fiscal -- calendar year. So there\u2019s not any material revenue associated with this built into our fiscal year guide, but we are very excited about the opportunity in 2023 and beyond. Yeah. So, I think very similar to what we had talked about at the very beginning of the year. The two strongest markets will continue to be our Pharma and Chemical and Energy market. I think, as we look at those, certainly, both of them performed better than we expected in Q1 and our expectation is that, those will continue to be the driver of growth for the full year, with Pharma probably at a roughly double-digit growth and Chemical and Energy about that high single-digit, double-digit growth as well, and then, followed very closely by Diagnostics in -- at high single-digits. And then food, environmental and academia and government are probably in the low-to-mid single digits, which is pretty consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year. And it\u2019s slightly different, but same directional for Q2 with Pharma probably being a little stronger. No. Yeah. We are very excited about our portfolio and how it plays into that space and are believing that that strong growth will continue going forward. Yeah. I will jump in there. it -- yeah, the team has done a fantastic job really driving margin and if we look at it, it\u2019s a combination of being able to cover our costs from the standpoint of the increased logistics and material costs, as well as very strong management discipline in the operating expenses. So it\u2019s a combination of being successful in our price, which we had talked about before and covering those costs, as well as being able to leverage kind of our infrastructure across all three of the groups. Yeah. So let me take the second part first. As Mike mentioned in the call, our demand continues to be very strong and we actually had order growth that exceeded revenue growth almost 2x and that gives us confidence around the order book going into Q2 really across multiple end markets. And so that gives us the ability to deliver the -- or expected to deliver the high growth in Q2. In regards to the range, there are still uncertainties out there, as Omicron continues to impact, mainly Asia right now and then some other uncertainties. So I think that\u2019s just taking a little wider lens, but we still feel good about the business for the full year. Yeah. Yeah. No. It doesn\u2019t. There is an element of getting tougher comps, but the momentum continues. I would say for Q2, it\u2019s more timing than anything else relative to the M&A. It is down slightly sequentially, but I would say, in the overall scheme of things, not material. Yes. Brandon, as usual, your notes are quite accurate and so let me address a couple of those things. So the Lunar New Year impact came in kind of as we anticipated, which should come back into Q2. That transit time or that $15 million that came in, but we haven\u2019t seen really the improvement. So that\u2019s still opportunities in the second half of this year. Our end of the quarter coincided with the large snowstorm in the U.S., but the shipments were out and we still were able to deliver. In terms of the first question was about Lunar. Yeah. Okay. I think on both. Brandon, we missed something? Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Quantify the book-to-bill. Yeah. I knew that there was something else. I was trying to avoid that one on purpose, because we are not going to provide that. But what I can tell you is that, the growth rate of our orders was twice as much as the revenue growth, and I would say, our backlog is the highest it\u2019s ever been. Yeah. Puneet to your first question on the quantification, we are not going to provide that other than what I had answered\u2026 This year. Forecast for this year. Yeah. Yeah. Patrick, just one other thing, we -- while we grew 3% as we mentioned, if we add back in kind of the Lunar New Year estimate, it was high-single digits, which was in our -- in line with what we had expected and our expectation is that, that\u2019s going to be for the full year as well. Now Q2 will be stronger than that, obviously, as it comes back and we also saw mid-teen -- mid-to-high-teens growth in orders in Q1. Yeah. I mean, for everything that we see, Patrick, funding levels continue in activity within our order book continues to be strong. So it not as strong obviously as the Pharma and C&E areas, which are leading the growth in the Diagnostics, but we are not seeing any fundamentally different performance in that market going forward. Yeah. I will take that, Jack. And I think we mentioned at the beginning of the year that we were estimating roughly a point of growth associated with that was about half of what we had seen normally to cover the increased costs, and what I would say is, through Q1 we are ahead of schedule, which is good. Yeah. I was going to say, we -- the team continues to do a fantastic job and continues to drive even more revenue and product out of the existing capacity and it was a great first quarter and slightly ahead of our expectations. We had expected double-digit growth and that continues to be our expectation before the new train, Train B comes online at the end of this calendar year. And the order book continues to be strong. That team continues to actually build the order book for 2023 and building that demand for that train. So we are extremely excited about that business and are looking forward to not only bringing that up, but also looking for other ways to expand our capacity. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. I will take it. It is still relatively small but growing very fast, which the market itself is quite large and so the opportunity here is really in front of us going forward. Yeah. Dan, to build on what Mike was saying, if we looked at those three big areas, over 90% or roughly 90% of our C&E business is actually Chemicals and Advanced Materials. And so the Energy piece is an important component, but that demand around new types of Chemicals, Advanced Materials and so forth is really what\u2019s driving it\u2026 And so whether it be batteries and other areas around these is the growth driver today. From Pharma, it grew -- it was roughly 2 points to 3 points of growth for pharma in Q1. Yeah. A point or two. Yeah. Spot on. Go ahead, Paul. Sorry."

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike. \nMike McMullen: Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Before we get into discussing our results and outlook, I want to mention that we're joined today by Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group; and Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group. We're also joined on this call for the first time by Phil Binns, President of the Agilent Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group. Phil\u2019s name may be new to some of you, but he's well-known at Agilent and in the industry. Phil has been with us for more than 13 years, coming over with the Varian acquisition and overseeing our market leading spectroscopy business. We\u2019re extremely pleased to have someone with Phil\u2019s knowledge, experience and proven leadership strength heading up our LSAG business. In his short time in the role, we\u2019ve already seen Phil add tremendous value as a member of our senior leadership team. Welcome, Phil. Now onto our fourth quarter results. The Agilent team once again continued to perform well under challenging market conditions. Revenue of $1.69 billion declined 9.7% core after increasing 17.5% last year. This is at the high end of our guidance. Our proactive approach to managing our cost structure in this market environment helped us deliver healthy fourth quarter operating margins of 27.8%. Q4 earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance. While this was a decline of 10%, it comes against a tough compare last year when EPS grew 26%. While the market continues to be challenging, we believe we are starting to see signs of stabilization. As an encouraging data point, for the quarter our book-to-bill ratio was 1 for the company and greater than 1 for our LSAG instruments. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our Q4 performance, starting with our regional results. During the quarter, while down year-on-year, we delivered sequential growth except for China, as expected. In China, our business declined 31% year-on-year after growing 44% in Q4 last year. While China was down sequentially, these results were very much in line with our expectations. And the year-on-year monthly performance improved slightly as the quarter progressed. In addition, orders were slightly higher than revenue for the quarter. While it is too early to call these two data points a trend, we see this as an encouraging sign of potential stabilization. In late September, I traveled to China for the first time since the COVID outbreak to meet with the Agilent team, key customers, and government officials. I was reminded of both the sheer size of the Chinese economy and our market there. I saw first-hand the work being done to bolster economic activity in the near-term and create an environment that will support continued growth into the future. I remain convinced China will continue to play an important role in life sciences and I\u2019m confident that the China market will return to growth. In looking at our largest end market, pharma declined 14% driven by continued caution among customers on capital expenditures for new instruments. Within pharma, biopharma performed better than small molecule. Geographically, our biopharma business outside of China grew high-single digits. Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenue of $928 million, down 18% core versus a tough compare last year of up 22%. Customers continue to hold off on capital expenditures, particularly in the pharma segment of LSAG\u2019s business, which declined in the high 20% range. This is against growth in the low 20s last year. On the other hand, we continue to see strong customer demand and growth in our PFAS solutions, as well as continued strength in the advanced materials segment. These are two secular trends we\u2019ve highlighted before and we remain optimistic about future growth in these market segments. While the market environment remains challenged, we continue to innovate and provide unique solutions for our customers. The new products we launched in June at ASMS, in particular the 6595 LC triple quad, which is focused on key applications like PFAS, continue to generate positive customer interest and new orders. We\u2019re also bringing innovative new solutions for customers across the biopharma value chain. We have installed a number of our online UHPLC systems with large biopharma companies. The systems are easy-to-use, reliable, and deliver significant value by providing fully automated analysis of critical quality attributes and allowing real time decision making outside the lab. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $404 million, up 4% core and 6% on a reported basis. ACG delivered growth across all end-markets, and in all regions except China. The contract services business was up double-digits, offset by the services associated with new instrument placements. Our strategy of increasing the connect rate continues to pay off. In the quarter, the contract services business represented 65% of ACG revenue, a number that has grown nicely over the years. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $356 million, flat on a core basis and up 1% reported. DGG\u2019s results were led by the pathology and NASD businesses, which both delivered low double-digit growth. These strong results were offset by the continued market challenges in genomics in both consumables and instruments. Our NASD portfolio and capacity expansion are continuing as planned. We\u2019re confident in the long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Before I finish covering DGG, I want to thank Sam Raha for his contributions over the years and for helping us build a strong foundation for the DGG business. I wish Sam well. In addition to these business group highlights, during the quarter we were recognized for our commitment to sustainability. Agilent\u2019s near and long-term targets for reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions have been approved by the highly regarded Science Based Targets initiative.  A year ago, we entered 2023 sharing a view of economic and industry uncertainty, as we guided for moderating growth in the second half of 2023. We had not anticipated, however, the significance of the market headwinds the industry eventually faced, particularly in the pharma market and China. Despite the challenging market conditions, we delivered full year revenue of $6.83 billion, growing 1.5% core. While our full-year growth was lower than initially expected, we met or exceeded every quarterly guidance range we provided, a solid testament to the team\u2019s execution ability. Including FY23 results, our 4-year compound annual growth rate is 7%. This is at the high end of our long-term growth guidance. In FY23, we delivered operating margins of 27.4%. This is up 30 basis points this year and up more than 400 basis points in the last four years. Earnings per share of $5.44 are up 4%, delivering leveraged earnings growth for the year. Our 4-year compound annual growth rate for EPS is 15%. Looking back, 2023 was a challenging year. What I\u2019m particularly proud of is the Agilent team\u2019s ability to quickly pivot and take action to address these challenges while staying relentlessly focused on our customers. While we\u2019ve worked to significantly reduce expenses, Agilent\u2019s customer satisfaction ratings remain at all-time highs. At the same time, our employee engagement continues to be excellent as we achieved a number of best employer awards over the last year. All of this helped us deliver another year of leveraged earnings in an extremely difficult market environment. Before turning it over to Bob for more details, I want to provide some high-level perspective on FY24 and beyond. For 2024, we anticipate a slow, but steady recovery, throughout the year. In our initial outlook, at the high end of our guidance we expect revenues to return to growth. At the same time, our range for EPS in the year ahead has us again delivering leveraged EPS growth. As we look ahead, we remain convinced the market challenges being faced by the industry today are transient. Our end markets are powered by investments in improving the human condition. The pace of science, innovation and discovery continues to increase, which will fuel further growth. We remain focused on winning in the marketplace. Our differentiated products, services and most importantly our One Agilent team, are all essential to the success of our customers. We are well-positioned for long-term growth. Bob will now share more detail on the quarter and the year, along with more specifics on our initial view for fiscal 2024 and Q1. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you.\nRobert McMahon: Thanks Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and the year, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our guidance for fiscal year 2024 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Agilent finished the fourth quarter with core growth at the top end of guidance and EPS exceeding our expectations as we executed well against challenging macroeconomic conditions. Q4 revenue was $1.69 billion, down 9.7% core and 8.7% on a reported basis. This is after growing 17.5% in Q4 last year, when we benefitted from the recovery from the Shanghai shutdown in Q2 of last year. This created an estimated 1 point of headwind in the year-on-year results this quarter. As expected, we saw weakness in capital purchases in LSAG with the biggest impact in our China business. Now, I\u2019d like to share additional detail on our end markets for the quarter. Revenue in our largest market pharma, declined 14%, versus 20% growth in Q4 last year. BioPharma declined 2% while small molecule was down 23%. However, biopharma ex-China was up 7% in the quarter and grew solidly for the year. And while small molecule was down, the decline was most pronounced in China. And outside China, small molecule was up sequentially in the quarter. Chemicals and advanced materials declined 11% versus growth of 27% last year, while flat sequentially. Our chemicals and energy subsegments were down 15% while advanced materials were down roughly 2% globally and up 4% in the Americas and Europe combined. The food market was down low double digits against a tough 20% growth comparison last year. High single digit growth in the Americas was offset by declines in all other regions. In the Americas, PFAS testing is emerging as an important growth area in food testing, helping drive the high single digit growth. We expect testing for PFAS chemicals will continue to be a growth driver across multiple end markets over time. The environmental and forensics market declined 3% versus 18% growth last year. Similar to the food market, the Americas region continues to experience strong growth, up double digits driven by PFAS. This strong performance was primarily offset by softness in China, which was down year-on-year, but up slightly on a sequential basis. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market declined 4%. While we delivered low double-digit growth in our pathology-related businesses, it was more than offset by continued weakness in genomics.  The academia and government market was down low single digits with strength in the Americas driven by government funding offset by weakness in China and Europe. Results were pressured across all geographies in the quarter. As Mike mentioned, China was down 31% year-on-year after growing 44% in Q4 of last year, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. The rest of Asia was down mid-single digits and both the Americas and Europe declined low single digits in the quarter.  Before turning to the rest of the P&L, I\u2019d like to quickly summarize some full year highlights by end market and geography. From an end market perspective, all markets grew low to mid-single digits for the year except for pharma, which was down 2% globally. In addition, all geographies grew, except China which was down 5%. Back to the P&L for the quarter. Despite the revenue declines, our team continues to execute at a very high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was 55.8%, and our operating margin was a healthy 27.8% in Q4, which was slightly better than our internal expectations. Below the line, we benefitted from stronger than expected cash flow generating incremental interest income in the quarter. Our tax rate was 13.75% and we had 293 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. Putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.38 for the quarter, exceeding our expectations, albeit down 10% from a year ago when EPS grew 26%. As Mike mentioned, our Q4 results capped a year where we grew 1.5% core on the topline, increased operating margins by 30 basis points and grew EPS by 4%, while overcoming a couple of points of currency headwinds. This is a real statement on the team\u2019s ability to quickly adapt to market changes while still delivering leveraged earnings growth. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the Agilent team as Q4 continued a string of very strong quarterly cash flow results. In Q4, we generated operating cash flow of $516 million, well over 100% of adjusted net income, and invested $84 million in capital expenditures. CapEx spending is driven by our ongoing NASD capacity expansion, which remains on track. For the year, we delivered $1.5 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 44% over last year. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of 0.6 times. With the current challenges in the market, it is great to be a company with a fortress balance sheet and strong cash flow. In the quarter, we paid out $66 million in dividends and spent $80 million to repurchase shares. And for the year, we returned $840 million to shareholders through $265 million in dividends and $575 million in share repurchases. Looking forward, you may have also seen that we recently announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend providing another source of value to our shareholders. It\u2019s worth noting that we have increased our dividend every year since we first began issuing them in 2012. Now, let\u2019s move on to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. As Mike stated, we expect to see a slow but steady recovery throughout fiscal 2024. However, we also acknowledge the continued market uncertainty, high interest rates, volatile exchange rates and depressed capital spending. Like several of our peers, we expect the markets to be down slightly for the year, while we expect to perform better. Given the expected slower market conditions, we have taken additional steps to adjust our cost structure. Incorporated into our guidance is roughly $175 million of cost savings. Given the significance, I want to provide a little more detail on these actions. Roughly 30% of the savings are related to portfolio optimization decisions we have taken in DGG, the largest of which was the exit of the Resolution Biosciences business. Another 25% is related to materials and logistics cost savings as well as optimizing our real estate footprint, with the remaining savings tied to continued reductions in discretionary spend and optimizing our workforce. Along with these actions, we have taken a $46 million charge for restructuring and other related costs in our Q4 GAAP results. These reductions, while difficult, are necessary to ensure we continue to fund our most critical investments as well as fund the variable compensation resets from this year. These actions help ensure the company delivers leveraged earnings growth in FY24 and will enable us to emerge even stronger when our markets inevitably return to their long-term growth rates. As Mike noted earlier, we exited Q4 with some potential signs of stabilization with a book to bill ratio of 1 for the company and greater than 1 for LSAG instruments. While this is positive, we are going to be prudent in our initial guidance. For the full year guide, we expect revenue in the range of $6.71 billion to $6.81 billion. This represents a core growth range from a slight decline of 0.5% at the low end to 1 point of growth at the high end. Currency is a headwind of 1.2 points while M&A is also a slight headwind of 10 basis points related to Resolution Bioscience.  On a reported basis, we are expecting a decline in the range of 1.8% to 0.3% year-on-year. From a geographic perspective, we expect modest growth in the Americas and Europe. While we expect to see recovery during the year in China, our initial view is it will still decline for the full year. From a business group perspective, we expect growth in both DGG and ACG, while LSAG instruments will still be pressured. In terms of phasing, we expect the first half of FY24 to look similar to the second half of FY23, with growth in the second half of next year. We are projecting modest operating margin expansion for the year. Below the line, we expect interest income and expense to offset each other, a tax rate of 13.5%, and 293 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.44 to $5.55. This range represents flat to 2% growth versus FY23. From a cash flow perspective, we expect another robust year. We are expecting roughly $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and $400 million in CapEx as spending increases on NASD\u2019s Train C and D expansions. Looking to Q1 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.605 billion. This represents a core decline of 11.3% to 8.5% with currency and M&A having a minimal impact. At the midpoint, we are expecting growth that resembles what we just delivered in Q4 and assumes no significant budget flush during the end of this calendar year. This is against another difficult comp of 10% growth in Q1 of last year. First quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.20 and $1.23 as the cost savings fully ramp through the quarter. As Mike indicated, while we are expecting low growth in 2024, we remain optimistic about the future of our markets and our long-term prospects. Our business remains very profitable and healthy, and I know we will come out stronger as a company when market growth returns. And now I will turn the floor back over to Parmeet for your questions. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Bob. Bo, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar : And some helpful comments here. Mike, maybe starting with those book-to-bill comments here. Overall company 1 turn LSAG instrumentation looks like it's turned. Curious what those book-to-bill numbers for ex-China? And if instrumentation has turned, that Q1 guidance, comps get easier. Why is Q1 assuming no benefit from this turn in instrumentation? \nRobert McMahon : Yes, Vijay. Let me take that. I think if you look at the book-to-bill ratio, it's -- for LSAG instruments, it's actually very similar to both including China and excluding China. China was actually slightly positive as well. So that's a good sign. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're taking a prudent approach to our first quarter. And certainly, we see this as a positive. We did have some -- we typically do have seasonality from our Q4 to Q1, but we're taking it kind of one quarter at a time. \nMike McMullen: Yes, I think part of the big story, too, Vijay, is the 10% comp from last year as well. But as we said it in the call, we were -- it was encouraging to see some initial signs of stabilization with that kind of book-to-bill on the instrument side. \nVijay Kumar : Understood. I'm glad to hear prudency and right off the bat here. \nMike McMullen: We got that into the script, Vijay. \nVijay Kumar : On -- just one more related on guidance here. What are you assuming for NASD in China for fiscal '24? \nRobert McMahon: Yes. So for China, we are thinking mid-single-digit decline for the full year. So very similar to this year. And then for NASD, right now, we're expecting low single-digit -- mid-single-digit growth. \nMike McMullen: Mid-singles. Yes. \nOperator: We go next now to Patrick Donnelly at Citi. \nPatrick Donnelly: Maybe kind of a follow-up on the 1Q guide. It seems like, again, the order's encouraging. Maybe a little bit prudent on the guide, as you said, I guess when you think about just the implication for the ramp 2Q to 4Q, is it optimism in the market based on some of those order trends is that obviously the comps get easier in the second half as you work through it. And can you just talk about the visibility into the recovery and kind of what gives you the confidence in the ramp as the year progresses here? \nMike McMullen: Yes, sure, Patrick. I want in lead off, Bob, and then you can add any additional comments you'd like to make here. But when we think about these comps around what we described as a gradual recovery and grow. I think is, first of all, important to remind the audience that we do expect the first half of the year to be very much like what we saw in the second half of '23. But looking forward, why do we think that things are going to be different in the second half which is though it's initial and still early, there are some early signs of potential stabilization that you see in our order book. The fact that book-to-bill for the company was above 1, the fact that we had the same result in our instrument business, which has been the most pressured part of the company. And listen, while it's too early for customers to be confirming their 2024 budgets with us, let's go back to the sales phone, which is a predictor of potential growth, right? So our sales funnels continue to show a lot of interest from customers. And we know that at some point in time of things will start to release. The funnels remain healthy.  And listen, an environment like this, we've seen these things before, which was healthy capital spending has been constrained. So some release can be expected. And we hear -- I don't want to get too down my skies on this, but we hear customers talk about some new focused investments. And I think we're not calling for a big broad-based market recovery, but certain segments of the market are going to be better. We're talking about some investments in R&D tools, what's going to PFAS testing capacity expansion plan we're hearing from our customers, Advanced Materials. And then as you mentioned earlier, Patrick, there's an easier compare in second half '24 as well. So we do expect this return to growth. And I think as -- it's not simply a hope. We've got some information to be kind of back up our thinking there. Again, we'll know a lot better about how things look when we get to the budgeting phase of our customers in early 2024.  Again, right now, the markets for capital -- instrument still remain quite challenged. And as I mentioned, we are seeing encouraging signs of potential stabilization, but it's going to be a journey for our return into growth. And I think our guide reflects that. And again, I think we're -- we've got a high degree of confidence this is what the back half of the year will look like. \nRobert McMahon: Yes. And Patrick, you asked about Q1, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think we're taking a prudent approach here. but we're also going up against last year where we did have a budget flush and happened earlier in the year but for delivery in November and December, and we're assuming that we're not seeing that or building that into our into our estimates. So that happens, then it would be -- that would be a nice thing for all of us. \nMike McMullen: Yes, absolutely, Bob. \nPatrick Donnelly : That's helpful. Bob. And maybe, Bob, just on the margin side, helpful to hear you talk through a few of the different moving pieces. It sounds like some cost savings in DGG, among others. I guess can you just give a bit more color on kind of the moving pieces, where you're pulling levers, the ability to take out some additional costs to hit these margin numbers. Obviously, you talked about margins being up a bit. I think there are some headwinds like incentive comp, things like that. So maybe just talk about the gives and takes there and confidence in terms of some of the cost outs. \nRobert McMahon: Yes, that's a great insight there, Patrick. Yes, because we do have some add backs, I would say that -- so don't take that $175 million and drop it to the bottom line because we have some resets, I would say roughly half of that is kind of a reset between our sales comp and variable pay. If we think about it is really across the P&L, the biggest piece actually is in DGG with the exit of the Res Bio business, but we've also taken some tough decisions in other product lines to streamline the portfolio there. And I would say roughly a little over 30% of that is associated with that. The other 25% is really within our COGS. Our OFS team has done a phenomenal job of really kind of leaning into reducing our costs around logistics and material costs. And then I talked about the site consolidation as well, which will show up and down the P&L. So we've taken a look at our real estate footprint and have actually closed several smaller sites between -- around the world really. And then the final piece is really kind of infrastructure optimization, which would be discretionary spend but then also headcount reductions that would be focused on areas where we've rightsized it to the demand.\nMike McMullen: And Patrick, this is Mike, I stated about the confidence about the growth recovery. I think when it comes to hitting the $175 million, high degree of confidence, we control this 100%, and we'll deliver on this. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Matt Sykes at Goldman Sachs. \nMatt Sykes: Maybe just on NASD, I noticed just over the past, call it 1.5 years, we've kind of gone from high double digits, low double digits next year, mid-single digits, which it's probably just some level of normalization as you ramp capacity. But just given the step up in CapEx you're guiding to next year, is there some wiggle room in terms of how you guys lay that capacity out? Or is the confidence in that market growth enough to keep investing in that area next year? \nMike McMullen: I'll jump right into that one. So I tried to make that come out in the script. But our plans to continue to invest for the future long-term growth this business remains high. We're going full steam ahead on the capital expansion and they're tracking according to plan. In fact, I think we'll probably do a little bit better on the cost side when all said and done relative to the CapEx that's involved. And Bob, maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the things we're seeing relative -- I think we commented on this before, but what have we seen in the marketplace relative to 2024 relative to NASD. \nRobert McMahon: Yes. I think, Matt, it's a great question. And so if we look at the details of kind of the mix, actually, I would say we have the most healthy mix of portfolio in NASD and '24 than we've had. So a significant increase in the number of programs that we are going to have been going through. Now it's a bigger component of clinical volume versus commercial volume, which I actually think bodes very well for the future going forward. We have seen some, I would say, some pausing of certain customers as associated with IRA but we think that, that's transitory. So as Mike said, we're not at all concerned about the long-term growth prospects of this market. And in fact, many of the programs that we're seeing come into our portfolio are actually as what we had talked about in previous calls, much larger targeted patient populations, which really speaks well to the volume. And then as Mike mentioned, we're actually expanding our portfolio, our technologies. And so it's not just siRNA, but we're having the ability to continue to grow our CRISPR -- GMP grade CRISPR business as well as antisense. So we're continuing to do that as well. \nMike McMullen: Sam, I know this will be your last call, would have thought it might be interesting for you to jump in here for a second. As part of your transition, you've been talking to a lot of our key customers. And I think we're hearing the same story from them about long-term growth continued investment here. \nSam Raha : Yes. Absolutely, Mike. I'll just add a couple of things to your and Bob's comments. One, we are now on contract with more major pharma than we ever have been. And it's very promising. If you look at publicly the percentage of their overall R&D budgets that they're now spending on therapeutic oligos, and we are in the driver's seat to win those opportunities. And just in the last couple of weeks alone, I've spoken with a number of our lead pharma partners, and they've reaffirmed. So there is a slight navigation through the IRA, as Bob mentioned, the conviction on their end of the market potential remains unchanged and in the leadership position to pursue that. \nMatt Sykes : Got it. That's a great amount of detail. Maybe just, Bob, for you, just on pricing. Kind of what's embedded for next year as you think about pricing? And how has pricing kind of trended over the course of this year? Are we back to sort of normalized levels of pricing that you guys have historically achieved? Or is there still some pricing gains to see sort of as we move into next year in certain areas of your business? \nRobert McMahon: Yes. Matt, that's a great question. And we ended the Q4 at just a little under 3% and actually for the full year was greater than that. So it actually continues to be hold up very well. What we're building into our plan for next year is roughly 2 percentage points of price, which, as you know, is greater than our historical kind of pre-COVID levels. And so what we've been able to do, I think, is -- really speaks to the value proposition that we have as well as the emerging mix of our businesses as well. \nOperator: We go next now to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPMorgan. \nRachel Vatnsdal: So first off, I just want to ask on China. You mentioned that the region is down 30% this quarter. That was in line with your expectations. You're expecting it to decline mid-singles again next year. So I guess, just how much of a function is that really due to some of the comps and starting to lap the easier comp late into next year versus is there anything structurally wrong with that market? And how do you expect China to continue to grow on that medium to long term? \nMike McMullen: Do you want to take the first part, Bob, I think it's... \nRobert McMahon: Yes, yes. So well, I think from the standpoint of the comps, what we would see is, obviously, if you looked at what we did in the first half of this year, we had very strong growth, and then we're going up against, extremely difficult comparisons this year. I mean, as I mentioned, we were down -- up 44% in Q4 of last year, so down 31% this year, we're still up over the 2 years. And as we think about this similar to the rest of the kind of the guide, we're expecting kind of declines in the mid-20s in Q1 and getting better from there. And some of that, it will be an easier comp. And I'm sure Mike will talk a little bit more about this, but we don't see anything structurally changing in the Chinese marketplace for life science tools. \nMike McMullen: Absolutely, Bob. Why don't pick up from there. So I made a few comments about this in the prepared remarks, but I may first trip to China since October 2019 when we're there for the [BCIA] show. And what did I see, first of all, I'll just remind how quickly things can happen in China. Electric vehicles everywhere, a lot more green, digital adoption was just amazing. I don't think anybody uses cash there anymore. And then you also remind as you travel around the country, just how big a country is, how big the economy is and how big the markets are for Life Sciences. But to your specific question, here's what I was hearing from customers and my team when I have seen as well, which was why do we think this market eventually will return to growth, all the things that have been driving this market over the years, which is primarily the Chinese government's 14th 5-year plan. They're still on it. They're pointing to long-term growth, improving the quality of life in China.  We're hearing stories of new environmental regs coming from PFAS. The anticorruption impacts that we've seen in the health and the pharma space look to may have peaked, with a lot of the actions occurring, which could ultimately long term, lead to more R&D investments because there'll be less money being spent in the SG&A area. But I don't want to be too short-term optimistic about this expansion of growth because the business is bouncing along at a certain level. And that's why we call it stabilization in our prepared remarks. So what we're seeing, what we're forecasting, what we're hearing is from our teams and our customers don't expect any significant near-term improvements but don't expect any significant near-term deterioration either. And I think that's why when you look at the year-to-year numbers in terms of growth rate, Bob, was probably a comp -- payer issue. But we've had a couple of months now just run at a certain level, and that gives us the sense that what -- I think we used were potential signs of stabilization. So I hope that helps. \nRachel Vatnsdal: Yes. No, that's helpful color. And then I just want to dig a little bit more on your comments around next year. So you mentioned that you expect the first half to be similar to what you're seeing in the back half of this year. So I guess, can you just walk us through in a little bit more detail what exactly you mean by that? Should we be expecting similarities from an organic growth perspective? Or are you really talking about more from a revenue dollar standpoint. And then same type of question on the trajectory of the rebound on margins and EPS next year. Should we expect kind of that similar ramp given the cost dynamic as well? \nRobert McMahon: Yes. I think if -- I'll try to answer all that in short order, Rachel. As we think about the first half of the year, yes, we think that we -- as we look at our business and look at that kind of book-to-bill, we've kind of troughed in Q2. Q3, I think we mentioned actually was a little better. It was less than -- still less than 1 and then Q4 continue to improve. And our expectation is that, that kind of performance will continue. Now we're going up against difficult comps when we were actually bleeding down our inventory. And that particularly happened in Q1 and Q2 of last year as we were talking about it. And so I would expect us to have the trough of '24 be in Q1, Q2 being a little better and then growing out of that as we benefit from the easier compares. And I would expect our P&L and the EPS to look very similar to that. Q1, we are -- we've taken most of the actions they will have all been taken in the first quarter, but they won't have a full quarter. And so we'll have full quarters of the cost savings in Q2 through Q4. And so as that business kind of improves as the business improves, we'll get more and more leverage on the bottom line. \nOperator: Moving on now to Derik De Bruin at Bank of America. \nDerik De Bruin: So can we talk a little bit about pharma? That market was up and down all year, not a lot of visibility. Are you seeing some of the orders that were sort of stuck in the funnel starting to come loose, right? I mean, how are you sort of looking at the pharma market going forward? \nMike McMullen: Yes, I think the answer is the deal funnel still remain elongated. So\u2026\nPadraig McDonnell: So yes, I think what we see from our funnels is that they're growing, but the velocity in closing deals from the point of funnel to order is still static on that side -- elongated. \nRobert McMahon: Yes. And Derik, I think if we think about the pharma end market, we're assuming very low single-digit growth for next year. And some of that is actually getting past the tougher comps in China. If we looked at actually our pharma business ex China, we grew in FY23. And actually, our biopharma business grew in total. And we think about small molecule was the area that was dragging the pharma business down as you know very well, that typically has a replacement cycle. We are well into that replacement cycle. We were up very high. We kept calling it. And we've seen that be very depressed, and our expectation is that will start coming back in earnest in '24, but probably in the back half of '24. \nDerik De Bruin: So this goes -- sorry to beat this up, but your China got going down. Pharma, you just basically said you've got -- not -- you don't have a ton of visibility, hope things have come back. I'm just not -- I'm curious why you can put a little bit more cushion in the guide, like that. It just seems like -- it still feels like it's a little bit -- it still feels like it's a little back end. Well, it's not a little a lot back-end heavy, given where we are soaring in the cycle? \nMike McMullen: Yes. I think as we said earlier, Derik, there's reason to believe that you have the comps working in our favor for the second half, there\u2019s real. And we know that customers want there's interest in the products. And I think they've got a step -- and by the way, we're not calling for this miracle snapback in 2024. But we're also saying that small markets continue to decline 20%, 30% on the numbers we're seeing this year, particularly, that's where the pressure has been. But we know that biopharma, they need some tools for R&D. We know that those replacement cycles only last -- can only be held up for so long. So there's confidence relative to what we see in the funnel. Deals aren't coming out of the funnel. And then although we are focusing here on pharma right now in his commentary, there's a lot of other strength in some of the other secular markets and applied markets, in particular, which is a nice diversification we have on the instrument side as well. And Bob, I don't know if there's any additional thoughts on the pharma story. \nRobert McMahon: No. \nDerik De Bruin: And just one final one. Just what were bookings. I mean, I know you said the book-to-bill was greater than 1, but I'm just curious in terms of bookings. And do you often see a spike in bookings in Q4 Basically, I'm just trying to get the sense of like what you saw as a head fake or you've got -- where you think you've got real demand here? \nRobert McMahon: Yes. So we don't give the absolute dollars rather than to say it was greater than 1. It was -- roughly 1 for the total company and then instruments were higher. Typically, we do see a where it is higher. So this kind of goes back to kind of our historical performance where orders are a little higher, particularly because we have October in our results. And so last year was actually an aberration, so to speak, as we're working down the backlog and this kind of gets back to our normal process. \nMike McMullen: Yes. And through the quarter, Derik, we saw a normal seasonality. So there wasn't anything unusual about the order pattern to kind of say, is this a head fake or not. So I think that also is one of the reasons why we say, okay, early signs of some stabilization here. Again, not huge growth. We're seeing stabilization. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Jack Meehan at Nephron Research. \nJack Meehan: So I wanted to dig a little bit more into LSAG in the quarter. Can you break down the growth between instruments and consumables and just any commentary across product lines. \nRobert McMahon: Everything I would say for the quarter was pressured, although consumables performed better than the instrumentation. Our consumables business was down kind of low single digits and against a very tough comp of almost 9%, 10%. And if you looked at it ex-China, that was largely influenced by China, we grew low single digits in consumables. \nJack Meehan: Okay. And so does that imply instruments may be down over 20% in the quarter? \nRobert McMahon: They were down, yes. \nJack Meehan: Okay. Yes. And I guess maybe just a follow up on Derik's question. I think everybody is trying to think about the right way to interpret this book-to-bill commentary, but just is there any additional color you can share on the magnitude were orders down in the quarter? Or I guess, just trying to understand because there was an easy or a difficult comp on revenue like are orders kind of more -- don't have a similar level of volatility. It should have mathematically been over 1, right? \nRobert McMahon: Yes. So the orders were down year-on-year, but obviously down not as much as revenue down year-on-year. And so when we look at it, I think that kind of shows though, the stabilization because we had some pretty significant revenue last year because of the recovery in the first thing Shanghai shutdown. So I don't think that, that -- we actually think that this is the best way to kind of look at it on a go-forward basis because we don't have the play of the backlog happening much anymore. And so actually, as we look at it on a quarterly basis, we've seen a nice, steady progression up back to historical numbers. \nMike McMullen: And Jack, I think it's fair to say, Bob, that one of the things we were conscious was a lot of commentary about how significantly things we're getting in terms of being worse. And as you know, we've been out for some time, calling for no year-end budget flush, constrained capital environment. We came into the year actually guiding for a slower growth in the second half. So what we're trying to intimate in the call today is what we've been saying for the last several quarters is exactly what we're seeing right now. And I thought -- we thought a proof point was the book-to-bill -- listen, it's not great out there in terms of robust growth, but the sky is also not falling either. \nOperator: The next now to Puneet Souda at Leerink Partners. \nPuneet Souda: First one on CrossLab. Bob, with 65% of your business being a service contracts, could you elaborate on what sort of growth contribution we should expect here for full year? And also, I don't know if you provided the LSAG expectation contribution for 2024 as well? \nRobert McMahon: Yes. For ACG, we're expecting kind of mid-single-digit growth as we are -- with the contracted services piece being double digit, but then being pressured by the instrumentation. So that will be moderated. And for the LSAG business, right now, we're looking at kind of low single-digit decline. Again, with a greater decline in the first half of the year and the return to better performance in the second half of the year. \nPuneet Souda: Got it. Okay. And then on -- if I could ask a little bit on am I onshoring that's point that you're pointing -- that's not something we are focused on in prior calls. And I hear you that you're growing on the PFAS side, but just wondered -- could you elaborate a little bit on both some onshoring as well as the environmental gains that you're having? And why shouldn't that contribute more to your instrumentation growth in 2024. \nRobert McMahon: Yes. It has the potential to do that. And as we talked about it, we're at the beginning of the year, and so we want to be prudent there. But there's nothing out there that doesn't say that, that should continue given the macro economic environment and the incentives that governments are providing to continue to invest. And actually, what we're seeing is nice business in Southeast Asia as well as India. And I would expect that to continue. That's where we're placing incremental investments to continue to drive and capture that demand. I would expect the same thing in the environmental area as well. But we're not going to build all of that in right now at the beginning of the year. \nMike McMullen: But I think we saw some trends too that we're starting to see, PFAS is also now driving some testing in the food marketplace as well as every country that we talk to is in the process of further enhancing their own reg. So we wanted to have some other areas of potential growth for the company beyond the story around pharma. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Josh Waldman at Cleveland Research. \nJosh Waldman: Maybe one for Bob and then one for Mike. Bob, maybe circling back on Derik's question, I wondered if you could provide more context on the forecasting process this round or the puts and takes that went into the organic guide. Could you take a step back, were there segments in the business that were like decelerating or slowing as you went into the guide or maybe areas where you're still trying to find bottom? And if so, how did you expect that in the guide? \nRobert McMahon: Yes. Obviously, this year has been one for the ages in terms of being able to try to manage the forecasting. And so we've taken a number of different angles at it to look at it. So not only growth rates, which I think is the focus here, but also actually if you looked at it on a sequential basis and look at the actual dollars, I think that that's probably more instructive, particularly as we were looking at the bleeding of the inventory. I would say what we've seen over the last couple of quarters is that signs of stabilization. There are always puts and takes across the various businesses. And we think that we've tried to do that. We've built in feedback based on the field's projections, the funnel that Mike and Padraig talked about and then an assumption around the conversion of those funnels. And we haven't seen the funnels slow down. There's still modest growth, and we're starting to see the slowing of the elongation. I'm not saying that it's stopped or accelerated in terms of the purchase but we are starting to see that slowing and you're actually seeing that in that book to bill. And when we look at the orders on a sequential basis, we're starting to see that kind of stabilization as well. And so that's kind of how we're looking at continuing to go forward. if you kind of just built that going into next year, you would start seeing a challenging first half and then better performance in the second half. Hopefully, that gives you some flavor. \nJosh Waldman: Yes, that's helpful. And that was actually going to be my follow-up. And maybe I don't know, Bob or Mike, if you want to take it. I was curious if you could maybe quantify where the funnel stands entering '24 versus maybe where it typically is entering the year? And just how correlative or how much do you think it is a predictor of near-term demand? I mean is that -- is better funnel conversion at all kind of part of what drives the improvement as you progress through the year? \nMike McMullen: I think pursuant to Padraig and Bob, kind of the same rates, right, no significant improvement. \nRobert McMahon: Correct. We're going up against -- the first half of this year, actually, what you saw was the elongation of those cycle times. And so what we're seeing right now is kind of -- like I said, it's not necessarily fully stable, but it's not decline -- or increasing at the rate that we saw in the first and second quarters of last year. And so you're starting to see that. And so all things being equal, that conversion is actually improving slightly versus a year ago. It's still not back to historical numbers. And that's what we're trying to handicap here as we look at our forecast going forward. \nOperator: We'll go next now to Daniel Brennan at Cowen. \nDaniel Brennan: Great. Maybe just on China. I know you mentioned, I think, in the prepared remarks like month-to-month pacing had improved in the quarter. Just any more color or anything on exit rates in China. And if you could, I'd be entered to get like some more color on the end market trends in China. I know you gave some color on biopharma, but could you discuss pharma overall and any other interesting color from an end market basis? \nMike McMullen: Sure. Bob, maybe we'll tag team on this, which was -- I think the -- relative to the order book, I think we were slightly above revenue for the quarter. No really unusual pacing through the quarter from China. We've been calling -- I know a lot of our conversation today has been about pharma, but we've been saying for some quarters overall for China, it's been a broad-based slowdown. And that's what the business has been, and that's how we ended the year in terms of the end market performance. I will say that we were pleased that we were in line with our expectations for the business. So again, we described earlier that the business was moving along at a certain overall level. I think we do have a view of China that we will still be down in terms of the revenue for the year. But reflective of where we are, where we're seeing the business right now. So\u2026 \nRobert McMahon: Dan, and to build on Mike's point, just a couple of other additional data points. we were down pretty significantly in all end markets in Q4, as you would expect because we were up 44% in Q4 of '22. And so that's probably not as relevant because we were catching up relative to some of the catch-up of the Shanghai shutdown. Another data point, though, is if we looked at kind of year-on-year growth actually, we exited October, the year-on-year performance. It was still a decline, but it was much better than what we saw at the beginning of the quarter. And so we actually saw a sequential improvement. I think Mike mentioned that in his prepared remarks. And then if we looked at kind of absolute dollars, they've been pretty steady month-on-month. \nDaniel Brennan: Got it. And then Chemical and Advanced Material was like a tale of 2 cities. It looks like C&E was down 15% in the quarter, you said and you talked a lot about PFAS. And so is there any more color like what you're seeing on kind of both sides of coin there? What's kind of baked in on the core chemical and energy side for the year and just anything on trends there? And then obviously, it sounds like you guys still remain really constructive on the Applied Materials side or Advanced Material side. \nMike McMullen: So how about Bob lead here a few comments. And then I've been dying to pull Phil in on here as well. And maybe talk about some of the things he's seen on the Advanced Materials side, which is a real area of expertise for him, so. But I think your word of tail of 2 cities is really quite appropriate, both in terms of breakout by segment, also by geography. I think we posted 70% growth, if I remember correctly, in China last year. So I mean that's a tough comp. I don't care who you are. But we're seeing continued slowness on the C&E side. Our major customers here are really conservative in terms of their deployment of capital. Many of our largest customers are on cost control. So that's been -- that's what you're seeing reflected in the numbers, and that's why we expect a constrained outlook on that side of the business for a while. The different story on the Advanced Materials, and I think Bob, you pointed to good growth geographically globally outside of China.  And then Phil, I know you and the team got a whole bunch of initiatives around the applied markets, particularly not only PFAS but Advanced Materials. And I thought a good opportunity for me to introduce you to the audience and have you share your perspective on what we're doing on the applied on the Advanced Materials side. \nPhil Binns: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes, certainly, we've mentioned you've talked around the activity within labs being ex-China, at least being reasonably robust. But on the applied market side and certainly around Advanced Materials. We're certainly relatively strong in those markets, and we're seeing good really good generation around the batteries market. And of course, we've spoken about the onshoring process around there in the Advanced Materials area. So globally, that obviously comes into the onshoring. And globally, we're in strong positions in those markets and have been historically and continue to innovate strongly around those markets and stay close to those customers. \nOperator: We go next now to Dan Leonard at UBS. \nDan Leonard: I wanted to circle back for a moment on the Q1 guide. You spoke about a challenging year-on-year comp a couple of times. But as you're thinking about the Q4 to Q1 sequential ramp in dollars, how much of that decline forecasted is what you chalk up to seasonality versus prudent if you could give us a flavor. \nMike McMullen: Great question, Bob. \nRobert McMahon: Yes, Dan, that's a great question. If you look at last year and our revenue went down roughly $90 million; $90 million, $95 million from an extremely strong Q4 to also a very strong -- if you look at the midpoint of the guide, it's a little over $105 million, $110 million. So there is an element of looking at what we did last year, again, not assuming a strong budget. I don't want to kind of parse it out to give you a percent, but that kind of at least gives you kind of how we were thinking about the Q1 guide relative to what we saw in Q1 of last year. \nDan Leonard: Appreciate that. And then as a follow-up, can you remind me in 2024, when do we lap the headwinds on the genomics side? And what is your appetite continued investment in genomics as part of the DGG portfolio. \nRobert McMahon: Yes, I would expect us to -- we will have a difficult Q1 and then starting to get better from Q2 and beyond, not dissimilar from the rest of some of the businesses. And then I'll let Mike talk about the kind of the investment. \nMike McMullen: Yes, I think first of all, just to remind the audience, when we talk about the genomics mix business, what are we talking about? We got a $500 million business, probably 50% of it is in QA/QC instrumentation, where we are the undisputed leader here, a lot of appetite to invest here. Our TapeStation product, particularly the consumables business is on fire right now. Capital side is constrained as we've seen across the marketplace. And then I think we all believe in the view that NGS will continue to be a growth market for us. And for the industry, I think that people are dying on back their expectations about how robust it is for a period of time. And I think we're seeing that in our business. So why do we make some of the structure changes we made in the portfolio because we want to ensure that we've got the ability to have a healthy P&L while at the same point in time invest in growth. So there's a reallocation of R&D dollars happening as a result of some of the changes we made that we talked about over the call. So answer the story is we have a lot of appetite for focused investments in areas where we think we can win in genomics. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions this afternoon. I'd like to turn things back to you Mr. Ahuja for any closing comments. \nParmeet Ahuja : Thanks, Bob, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. With that, we would like to end the call. Have a good day, everyone. \nOperator: Thank you. Again, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the Agilent Technologies Q4 2023 Earnings Call. Again, thanks for joining us, and we wish you all a great evening. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter and the year, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I\u2019ll then finish up with our guidance for fiscal year 2024 and the first quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Agilent finished the fourth quarter with core growth at the top end of guidance and EPS exceeding our expectations as we executed well against challenging macroeconomic conditions. Q4 revenue was $1.69 billion, down 9.7% core and 8.7% on a reported basis. This is after growing 17.5% in Q4 last year, when we benefitted from the recovery from the Shanghai shutdown in Q2 of last year. This created an estimated 1 point of headwind in the year-on-year results this quarter. As expected, we saw weakness in capital purchases in LSAG with the biggest impact in our China business. Now, I\u2019d like to share additional detail on our end markets for the quarter. Revenue in our largest market pharma, declined 14%, versus 20% growth in Q4 last year. BioPharma declined 2% while small molecule was down 23%. However, biopharma ex-China was up 7% in the quarter and grew solidly for the year. And while small molecule was down, the decline was most pronounced in China. And outside China, small molecule was up sequentially in the quarter. Chemicals and advanced materials declined 11% versus growth of 27% last year, while flat sequentially. Our chemicals and energy subsegments were down 15% while advanced materials were down roughly 2% globally and up 4% in the Americas and Europe combined. The food market was down low double digits against a tough 20% growth comparison last year. High single digit growth in the Americas was offset by declines in all other regions. In the Americas, PFAS testing is emerging as an important growth area in food testing, helping drive the high single digit growth. We expect testing for PFAS chemicals will continue to be a growth driver across multiple end markets over time. The environmental and forensics market declined 3% versus 18% growth last year. Similar to the food market, the Americas region continues to experience strong growth, up double digits driven by PFAS. This strong performance was primarily offset by softness in China, which was down year-on-year, but up slightly on a sequential basis. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market declined 4%. While we delivered low double-digit growth in our pathology-related businesses, it was more than offset by continued weakness in genomics.  The academia and government market was down low single digits with strength in the Americas driven by government funding offset by weakness in China and Europe. Results were pressured across all geographies in the quarter. As Mike mentioned, China was down 31% year-on-year after growing 44% in Q4 of last year, in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. The rest of Asia was down mid-single digits and both the Americas and Europe declined low single digits in the quarter.  Before turning to the rest of the P&L, I\u2019d like to quickly summarize some full year highlights by end market and geography. From an end market perspective, all markets grew low to mid-single digits for the year except for pharma, which was down 2% globally. In addition, all geographies grew, except China which was down 5%. Back to the P&L for the quarter. Despite the revenue declines, our team continues to execute at a very high level. Fourth quarter gross margin was 55.8%, and our operating margin was a healthy 27.8% in Q4, which was slightly better than our internal expectations. Below the line, we benefitted from stronger than expected cash flow generating incremental interest income in the quarter. Our tax rate was 13.75% and we had 293 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. Putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.38 for the quarter, exceeding our expectations, albeit down 10% from a year ago when EPS grew 26%. As Mike mentioned, our Q4 results capped a year where we grew 1.5% core on the topline, increased operating margins by 30 basis points and grew EPS by 4%, while overcoming a couple of points of currency headwinds. This is a real statement on the team\u2019s ability to quickly adapt to market changes while still delivering leveraged earnings growth. Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the Agilent team as Q4 continued a string of very strong quarterly cash flow results. In Q4, we generated operating cash flow of $516 million, well over 100% of adjusted net income, and invested $84 million in capital expenditures. CapEx spending is driven by our ongoing NASD capacity expansion, which remains on track. For the year, we delivered $1.5 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 44% over last year. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of 0.6 times. With the current challenges in the market, it is great to be a company with a fortress balance sheet and strong cash flow. In the quarter, we paid out $66 million in dividends and spent $80 million to repurchase shares. And for the year, we returned $840 million to shareholders through $265 million in dividends and $575 million in share repurchases. Looking forward, you may have also seen that we recently announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend providing another source of value to our shareholders. It\u2019s worth noting that we have increased our dividend every year since we first began issuing them in 2012. Now, let\u2019s move on to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. As Mike stated, we expect to see a slow but steady recovery throughout fiscal 2024. However, we also acknowledge the continued market uncertainty, high interest rates, volatile exchange rates and depressed capital spending. Like several of our peers, we expect the markets to be down slightly for the year, while we expect to perform better. Given the expected slower market conditions, we have taken additional steps to adjust our cost structure. Incorporated into our guidance is roughly $175 million of cost savings. Given the significance, I want to provide a little more detail on these actions. Roughly 30% of the savings are related to portfolio optimization decisions we have taken in DGG, the largest of which was the exit of the Resolution Biosciences business. Another 25% is related to materials and logistics cost savings as well as optimizing our real estate footprint, with the remaining savings tied to continued reductions in discretionary spend and optimizing our workforce. Along with these actions, we have taken a $46 million charge for restructuring and other related costs in our Q4 GAAP results. These reductions, while difficult, are necessary to ensure we continue to fund our most critical investments as well as fund the variable compensation resets from this year. These actions help ensure the company delivers leveraged earnings growth in FY24 and will enable us to emerge even stronger when our markets inevitably return to their long-term growth rates. As Mike noted earlier, we exited Q4 with some potential signs of stabilization with a book to bill ratio of 1 for the company and greater than 1 for LSAG instruments. While this is positive, we are going to be prudent in our initial guidance. For the full year guide, we expect revenue in the range of $6.71 billion to $6.81 billion. This represents a core growth range from a slight decline of 0.5% at the low end to 1 point of growth at the high end. Currency is a headwind of 1.2 points while M&A is also a slight headwind of 10 basis points related to Resolution Bioscience.  On a reported basis, we are expecting a decline in the range of 1.8% to 0.3% year-on-year. From a geographic perspective, we expect modest growth in the Americas and Europe. While we expect to see recovery during the year in China, our initial view is it will still decline for the full year. From a business group perspective, we expect growth in both DGG and ACG, while LSAG instruments will still be pressured. In terms of phasing, we expect the first half of FY24 to look similar to the second half of FY23, with growth in the second half of next year. We are projecting modest operating margin expansion for the year. Below the line, we expect interest income and expense to offset each other, a tax rate of 13.5%, and 293 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.44 to $5.55. This range represents flat to 2% growth versus FY23. From a cash flow perspective, we expect another robust year. We are expecting roughly $1.6 billion in operating cash flow and $400 million in CapEx as spending increases on NASD\u2019s Train C and D expansions. Looking to Q1 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $1.555 billion to $1.605 billion. This represents a core decline of 11.3% to 8.5% with currency and M&A having a minimal impact. At the midpoint, we are expecting growth that resembles what we just delivered in Q4 and assumes no significant budget flush during the end of this calendar year. This is against another difficult comp of 10% growth in Q1 of last year. First quarter 2024 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.20 and $1.23 as the cost savings fully ramp through the quarter. As Mike indicated, while we are expecting low growth in 2024, we remain optimistic about the future of our markets and our long-term prospects. Our business remains very profitable and healthy, and I know we will come out stronger as a company when market growth returns. And now I will turn the floor back over to Parmeet for your questions. Parmeet? Yes, Vijay. Let me take that. I think if you look at the book-to-bill ratio, it's -- for LSAG instruments, it's actually very similar to both including China and excluding China. China was actually slightly positive as well. So that's a good sign. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're taking a prudent approach to our first quarter. And certainly, we see this as a positive. We did have some -- we typically do have seasonality from our Q4 to Q1, but we're taking it kind of one quarter at a time. Yes. So for China, we are thinking mid-single-digit decline for the full year. So very similar to this year. And then for NASD, right now, we're expecting low single-digit -- mid-single-digit growth. Yes. And Patrick, you asked about Q1, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think we're taking a prudent approach here. but we're also going up against last year where we did have a budget flush and happened earlier in the year but for delivery in November and December, and we're assuming that we're not seeing that or building that into our into our estimates. So that happens, then it would be -- that would be a nice thing for all of us. Yes, that's a great insight there, Patrick. Yes, because we do have some add backs, I would say that -- so don't take that $175 million and drop it to the bottom line because we have some resets, I would say roughly half of that is kind of a reset between our sales comp and variable pay. If we think about it is really across the P&L, the biggest piece actually is in DGG with the exit of the Res Bio business, but we've also taken some tough decisions in other product lines to streamline the portfolio there. And I would say roughly a little over 30% of that is associated with that. The other 25% is really within our COGS. Our OFS team has done a phenomenal job of really kind of leaning into reducing our costs around logistics and material costs. And then I talked about the site consolidation as well, which will show up and down the P&L. So we've taken a look at our real estate footprint and have actually closed several smaller sites between -- around the world really. And then the final piece is really kind of infrastructure optimization, which would be discretionary spend but then also headcount reductions that would be focused on areas where we've rightsized it to the demand. Yes. I think, Matt, it's a great question. And so if we look at the details of kind of the mix, actually, I would say we have the most healthy mix of portfolio in NASD and '24 than we've had. So a significant increase in the number of programs that we are going to have been going through. Now it's a bigger component of clinical volume versus commercial volume, which I actually think bodes very well for the future going forward. We have seen some, I would say, some pausing of certain customers as associated with IRA but we think that, that's transitory. So as Mike said, we're not at all concerned about the long-term growth prospects of this market. And in fact, many of the programs that we're seeing come into our portfolio are actually as what we had talked about in previous calls, much larger targeted patient populations, which really speaks well to the volume. And then as Mike mentioned, we're actually expanding our portfolio, our technologies. And so it's not just siRNA, but we're having the ability to continue to grow our CRISPR -- GMP grade CRISPR business as well as antisense. So we're continuing to do that as well. Yes. Matt, that's a great question. And we ended the Q4 at just a little under 3% and actually for the full year was greater than that. So it actually continues to be hold up very well. What we're building into our plan for next year is roughly 2 percentage points of price, which, as you know, is greater than our historical kind of pre-COVID levels. And so what we've been able to do, I think, is -- really speaks to the value proposition that we have as well as the emerging mix of our businesses as well. Yes, yes. So well, I think from the standpoint of the comps, what we would see is, obviously, if you looked at what we did in the first half of this year, we had very strong growth, and then we're going up against, extremely difficult comparisons this year. I mean, as I mentioned, we were down -- up 44% in Q4 of last year, so down 31% this year, we're still up over the 2 years. And as we think about this similar to the rest of the kind of the guide, we're expecting kind of declines in the mid-20s in Q1 and getting better from there. And some of that, it will be an easier comp. And I'm sure Mike will talk a little bit more about this, but we don't see anything structurally changing in the Chinese marketplace for life science tools. Yes. I think if -- I'll try to answer all that in short order, Rachel. As we think about the first half of the year, yes, we think that we -- as we look at our business and look at that kind of book-to-bill, we've kind of troughed in Q2. Q3, I think we mentioned actually was a little better. It was less than -- still less than 1 and then Q4 continue to improve. And our expectation is that, that kind of performance will continue. Now we're going up against difficult comps when we were actually bleeding down our inventory. And that particularly happened in Q1 and Q2 of last year as we were talking about it. And so I would expect us to have the trough of '24 be in Q1, Q2 being a little better and then growing out of that as we benefit from the easier compares. And I would expect our P&L and the EPS to look very similar to that. Q1, we are -- we've taken most of the actions they will have all been taken in the first quarter, but they won't have a full quarter. And so we'll have full quarters of the cost savings in Q2 through Q4. And so as that business kind of improves as the business improves, we'll get more and more leverage on the bottom line. Yes. And Derik, I think if we think about the pharma end market, we're assuming very low single-digit growth for next year. And some of that is actually getting past the tougher comps in China. If we looked at actually our pharma business ex China, we grew in FY23. And actually, our biopharma business grew in total. And we think about small molecule was the area that was dragging the pharma business down as you know very well, that typically has a replacement cycle. We are well into that replacement cycle. We were up very high. We kept calling it. And we've seen that be very depressed, and our expectation is that will start coming back in earnest in '24, but probably in the back half of '24. No. Yes. So we don't give the absolute dollars rather than to say it was greater than 1. It was -- roughly 1 for the total company and then instruments were higher. Typically, we do see a where it is higher. So this kind of goes back to kind of our historical performance where orders are a little higher, particularly because we have October in our results. And so last year was actually an aberration, so to speak, as we're working down the backlog and this kind of gets back to our normal process. Everything I would say for the quarter was pressured, although consumables performed better than the instrumentation. Our consumables business was down kind of low single digits and against a very tough comp of almost 9%, 10%. And if you looked at it ex-China, that was largely influenced by China, we grew low single digits in consumables. They were down, yes. Yes. So the orders were down year-on-year, but obviously down not as much as revenue down year-on-year. And so when we look at it, I think that kind of shows though, the stabilization because we had some pretty significant revenue last year because of the recovery in the first thing Shanghai shutdown. So I don't think that, that -- we actually think that this is the best way to kind of look at it on a go-forward basis because we don't have the play of the backlog happening much anymore. And so actually, as we look at it on a quarterly basis, we've seen a nice, steady progression up back to historical numbers. Yes. For ACG, we're expecting kind of mid-single-digit growth as we are -- with the contracted services piece being double digit, but then being pressured by the instrumentation. So that will be moderated. And for the LSAG business, right now, we're looking at kind of low single-digit decline. Again, with a greater decline in the first half of the year and the return to better performance in the second half of the year. Yes. It has the potential to do that. And as we talked about it, we're at the beginning of the year, and so we want to be prudent there. But there's nothing out there that doesn't say that, that should continue given the macro economic environment and the incentives that governments are providing to continue to invest. And actually, what we're seeing is nice business in Southeast Asia as well as India. And I would expect that to continue. That's where we're placing incremental investments to continue to drive and capture that demand. I would expect the same thing in the environmental area as well. But we're not going to build all of that in right now at the beginning of the year. Yes. Obviously, this year has been one for the ages in terms of being able to try to manage the forecasting. And so we've taken a number of different angles at it to look at it. So not only growth rates, which I think is the focus here, but also actually if you looked at it on a sequential basis and look at the actual dollars, I think that that's probably more instructive, particularly as we were looking at the bleeding of the inventory. I would say what we've seen over the last couple of quarters is that signs of stabilization. There are always puts and takes across the various businesses. And we think that we've tried to do that. We've built in feedback based on the field's projections, the funnel that Mike and Padraig talked about and then an assumption around the conversion of those funnels. And we haven't seen the funnels slow down. There's still modest growth, and we're starting to see the slowing of the elongation. I'm not saying that it's stopped or accelerated in terms of the purchase but we are starting to see that slowing and you're actually seeing that in that book to bill. And when we look at the orders on a sequential basis, we're starting to see that kind of stabilization as well. And so that's kind of how we're looking at continuing to go forward. if you kind of just built that going into next year, you would start seeing a challenging first half and then better performance in the second half. Hopefully, that gives you some flavor. Correct. We're going up against -- the first half of this year, actually, what you saw was the elongation of those cycle times. And so what we're seeing right now is kind of -- like I said, it's not necessarily fully stable, but it's not decline -- or increasing at the rate that we saw in the first and second quarters of last year. And so you're starting to see that. And so all things being equal, that conversion is actually improving slightly versus a year ago. It's still not back to historical numbers. And that's what we're trying to handicap here as we look at our forecast going forward. Dan, and to build on Mike's point, just a couple of other additional data points. we were down pretty significantly in all end markets in Q4, as you would expect because we were up 44% in Q4 of '22. And so that's probably not as relevant because we were catching up relative to some of the catch-up of the Shanghai shutdown. Another data point, though, is if we looked at kind of year-on-year growth actually, we exited October, the year-on-year performance. It was still a decline, but it was much better than what we saw at the beginning of the quarter. And so we actually saw a sequential improvement. I think Mike mentioned that in his prepared remarks. And then if we looked at kind of absolute dollars, they've been pretty steady month-on-month. Yes, Dan, that's a great question. If you look at last year and our revenue went down roughly $90 million; $90 million, $95 million from an extremely strong Q4 to also a very strong -- if you look at the midpoint of the guide, it's a little over $105 million, $110 million. So there is an element of looking at what we did last year, again, not assuming a strong budget. I don't want to kind of parse it out to give you a percent, but that kind of at least gives you kind of how we were thinking about the Q1 guide relative to what we saw in Q1 of last year. Yes, I would expect us to -- we will have a difficult Q1 and then starting to get better from Q2 and beyond, not dissimilar from the rest of some of the businesses. And then I'll let Mike talk about the kind of the investment."

            "content": "Yes. Absolutely, Mike. I'll just add a couple of things to your and Bob's comments. One, we are now on contract with more major pharma than we ever have been. And it's very promising. If you look at publicly the percentage of their overall R&D budgets that they're now spending on therapeutic oligos, and we are in the driver's seat to win those opportunities. And just in the last couple of weeks alone, I've spoken with a number of our lead pharma partners, and they've reaffirmed. So there is a slight navigation through the IRA, as Bob mentioned, the conviction on their end of the market potential remains unchanged and in the leadership position to pursue that."

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. Before we get into discussing our results and outlook, I want to mention that we're joined today by Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group; and Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group. We're also joined on this call for the first time by Phil Binns, President of the Agilent Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group. Phil\u2019s name may be new to some of you, but he's well-known at Agilent and in the industry. Phil has been with us for more than 13 years, coming over with the Varian acquisition and overseeing our market leading spectroscopy business. We\u2019re extremely pleased to have someone with Phil\u2019s knowledge, experience and proven leadership strength heading up our LSAG business. In his short time in the role, we\u2019ve already seen Phil add tremendous value as a member of our senior leadership team. Welcome, Phil. Now onto our fourth quarter results. The Agilent team once again continued to perform well under challenging market conditions. Revenue of $1.69 billion declined 9.7% core after increasing 17.5% last year. This is at the high end of our guidance. Our proactive approach to managing our cost structure in this market environment helped us deliver healthy fourth quarter operating margins of 27.8%. Q4 earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance. While this was a decline of 10%, it comes against a tough compare last year when EPS grew 26%. While the market continues to be challenging, we believe we are starting to see signs of stabilization. As an encouraging data point, for the quarter our book-to-bill ratio was 1 for the company and greater than 1 for our LSAG instruments. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our Q4 performance, starting with our regional results. During the quarter, while down year-on-year, we delivered sequential growth except for China, as expected. In China, our business declined 31% year-on-year after growing 44% in Q4 last year. While China was down sequentially, these results were very much in line with our expectations. And the year-on-year monthly performance improved slightly as the quarter progressed. In addition, orders were slightly higher than revenue for the quarter. While it is too early to call these two data points a trend, we see this as an encouraging sign of potential stabilization. In late September, I traveled to China for the first time since the COVID outbreak to meet with the Agilent team, key customers, and government officials. I was reminded of both the sheer size of the Chinese economy and our market there. I saw first-hand the work being done to bolster economic activity in the near-term and create an environment that will support continued growth into the future. I remain convinced China will continue to play an important role in life sciences and I\u2019m confident that the China market will return to growth. In looking at our largest end market, pharma declined 14% driven by continued caution among customers on capital expenditures for new instruments. Within pharma, biopharma performed better than small molecule. Geographically, our biopharma business outside of China grew high-single digits. Looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenue of $928 million, down 18% core versus a tough compare last year of up 22%. Customers continue to hold off on capital expenditures, particularly in the pharma segment of LSAG\u2019s business, which declined in the high 20% range. This is against growth in the low 20s last year. On the other hand, we continue to see strong customer demand and growth in our PFAS solutions, as well as continued strength in the advanced materials segment. These are two secular trends we\u2019ve highlighted before and we remain optimistic about future growth in these market segments. While the market environment remains challenged, we continue to innovate and provide unique solutions for our customers. The new products we launched in June at ASMS, in particular the 6595 LC triple quad, which is focused on key applications like PFAS, continue to generate positive customer interest and new orders. We\u2019re also bringing innovative new solutions for customers across the biopharma value chain. We have installed a number of our online UHPLC systems with large biopharma companies. The systems are easy-to-use, reliable, and deliver significant value by providing fully automated analysis of critical quality attributes and allowing real time decision making outside the lab. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $404 million, up 4% core and 6% on a reported basis. ACG delivered growth across all end-markets, and in all regions except China. The contract services business was up double-digits, offset by the services associated with new instrument placements. Our strategy of increasing the connect rate continues to pay off. In the quarter, the contract services business represented 65% of ACG revenue, a number that has grown nicely over the years. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $356 million, flat on a core basis and up 1% reported. DGG\u2019s results were led by the pathology and NASD businesses, which both delivered low double-digit growth. These strong results were offset by the continued market challenges in genomics in both consumables and instruments. Our NASD portfolio and capacity expansion are continuing as planned. We\u2019re confident in the long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Before I finish covering DGG, I want to thank Sam Raha for his contributions over the years and for helping us build a strong foundation for the DGG business. I wish Sam well. In addition to these business group highlights, during the quarter we were recognized for our commitment to sustainability. Agilent\u2019s near and long-term targets for reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions have been approved by the highly regarded Science Based Targets initiative.  A year ago, we entered 2023 sharing a view of economic and industry uncertainty, as we guided for moderating growth in the second half of 2023. We had not anticipated, however, the significance of the market headwinds the industry eventually faced, particularly in the pharma market and China. Despite the challenging market conditions, we delivered full year revenue of $6.83 billion, growing 1.5% core. While our full-year growth was lower than initially expected, we met or exceeded every quarterly guidance range we provided, a solid testament to the team\u2019s execution ability. Including FY23 results, our 4-year compound annual growth rate is 7%. This is at the high end of our long-term growth guidance. In FY23, we delivered operating margins of 27.4%. This is up 30 basis points this year and up more than 400 basis points in the last four years. Earnings per share of $5.44 are up 4%, delivering leveraged earnings growth for the year. Our 4-year compound annual growth rate for EPS is 15%. Looking back, 2023 was a challenging year. What I\u2019m particularly proud of is the Agilent team\u2019s ability to quickly pivot and take action to address these challenges while staying relentlessly focused on our customers. While we\u2019ve worked to significantly reduce expenses, Agilent\u2019s customer satisfaction ratings remain at all-time highs. At the same time, our employee engagement continues to be excellent as we achieved a number of best employer awards over the last year. All of this helped us deliver another year of leveraged earnings in an extremely difficult market environment. Before turning it over to Bob for more details, I want to provide some high-level perspective on FY24 and beyond. For 2024, we anticipate a slow, but steady recovery, throughout the year. In our initial outlook, at the high end of our guidance we expect revenues to return to growth. At the same time, our range for EPS in the year ahead has us again delivering leveraged EPS growth. As we look ahead, we remain convinced the market challenges being faced by the industry today are transient. Our end markets are powered by investments in improving the human condition. The pace of science, innovation and discovery continues to increase, which will fuel further growth. We remain focused on winning in the marketplace. Our differentiated products, services and most importantly our One Agilent team, are all essential to the success of our customers. We are well-positioned for long-term growth. Bob will now share more detail on the quarter and the year, along with more specifics on our initial view for fiscal 2024 and Q1. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you. Yes, I think part of the big story, too, Vijay, is the 10% comp from last year as well. But as we said it in the call, we were -- it was encouraging to see some initial signs of stabilization with that kind of book-to-bill on the instrument side. We got that into the script, Vijay. Mid-singles. Yes. Yes, sure, Patrick. I want in lead off, Bob, and then you can add any additional comments you'd like to make here. But when we think about these comps around what we described as a gradual recovery and grow. I think is, first of all, important to remind the audience that we do expect the first half of the year to be very much like what we saw in the second half of '23. But looking forward, why do we think that things are going to be different in the second half which is though it's initial and still early, there are some early signs of potential stabilization that you see in our order book. The fact that book-to-bill for the company was above 1, the fact that we had the same result in our instrument business, which has been the most pressured part of the company. And listen, while it's too early for customers to be confirming their 2024 budgets with us, let's go back to the sales phone, which is a predictor of potential growth, right? So our sales funnels continue to show a lot of interest from customers. And we know that at some point in time of things will start to release. The funnels remain healthy.  And listen, an environment like this, we've seen these things before, which was healthy capital spending has been constrained. So some release can be expected. And we hear -- I don't want to get too down my skies on this, but we hear customers talk about some new focused investments. And I think we're not calling for a big broad-based market recovery, but certain segments of the market are going to be better. We're talking about some investments in R&D tools, what's going to PFAS testing capacity expansion plan we're hearing from our customers, Advanced Materials. And then as you mentioned earlier, Patrick, there's an easier compare in second half '24 as well. So we do expect this return to growth. And I think as -- it's not simply a hope. We've got some information to be kind of back up our thinking there. Again, we'll know a lot better about how things look when we get to the budgeting phase of our customers in early 2024.  Again, right now, the markets for capital -- instrument still remain quite challenged. And as I mentioned, we are seeing encouraging signs of potential stabilization, but it's going to be a journey for our return into growth. And I think our guide reflects that. And again, I think we're -- we've got a high degree of confidence this is what the back half of the year will look like. Yes, absolutely, Bob. And Patrick, this is Mike, I stated about the confidence about the growth recovery. I think when it comes to hitting the $175 million, high degree of confidence, we control this 100%, and we'll deliver on this. I'll jump right into that one. So I tried to make that come out in the script. But our plans to continue to invest for the future long-term growth this business remains high. We're going full steam ahead on the capital expansion and they're tracking according to plan. In fact, I think we'll probably do a little bit better on the cost side when all said and done relative to the CapEx that's involved. And Bob, maybe you can talk a little bit about some of the things we're seeing relative -- I think we commented on this before, but what have we seen in the marketplace relative to 2024 relative to NASD. Sam, I know this will be your last call, would have thought it might be interesting for you to jump in here for a second. As part of your transition, you've been talking to a lot of our key customers. And I think we're hearing the same story from them about long-term growth continued investment here. Do you want to take the first part, Bob, I think it's... Absolutely, Bob. Why don't pick up from there. So I made a few comments about this in the prepared remarks, but I may first trip to China since October 2019 when we're there for the [BCIA] show. And what did I see, first of all, I'll just remind how quickly things can happen in China. Electric vehicles everywhere, a lot more green, digital adoption was just amazing. I don't think anybody uses cash there anymore. And then you also remind as you travel around the country, just how big a country is, how big the economy is and how big the markets are for Life Sciences. But to your specific question, here's what I was hearing from customers and my team when I have seen as well, which was why do we think this market eventually will return to growth, all the things that have been driving this market over the years, which is primarily the Chinese government's 14th 5-year plan. They're still on it. They're pointing to long-term growth, improving the quality of life in China.  We're hearing stories of new environmental regs coming from PFAS. The anticorruption impacts that we've seen in the health and the pharma space look to may have peaked, with a lot of the actions occurring, which could ultimately long term, lead to more R&D investments because there'll be less money being spent in the SG&A area. But I don't want to be too short-term optimistic about this expansion of growth because the business is bouncing along at a certain level. And that's why we call it stabilization in our prepared remarks. So what we're seeing, what we're forecasting, what we're hearing is from our teams and our customers don't expect any significant near-term improvements but don't expect any significant near-term deterioration either. And I think that's why when you look at the year-to-year numbers in terms of growth rate, Bob, was probably a comp -- payer issue. But we've had a couple of months now just run at a certain level, and that gives us the sense that what -- I think we used were potential signs of stabilization. So I hope that helps. Yes, I think the answer is the deal funnel still remain elongated. So\u2026 Yes. I think as we said earlier, Derik, there's reason to believe that you have the comps working in our favor for the second half, there\u2019s real. And we know that customers want there's interest in the products. And I think they've got a step -- and by the way, we're not calling for this miracle snapback in 2024. But we're also saying that small markets continue to decline 20%, 30% on the numbers we're seeing this year, particularly, that's where the pressure has been. But we know that biopharma, they need some tools for R&D. We know that those replacement cycles only last -- can only be held up for so long. So there's confidence relative to what we see in the funnel. Deals aren't coming out of the funnel. And then although we are focusing here on pharma right now in his commentary, there's a lot of other strength in some of the other secular markets and applied markets, in particular, which is a nice diversification we have on the instrument side as well. And Bob, I don't know if there's any additional thoughts on the pharma story. Yes. And through the quarter, Derik, we saw a normal seasonality. So there wasn't anything unusual about the order pattern to kind of say, is this a head fake or not. So I think that also is one of the reasons why we say, okay, early signs of some stabilization here. Again, not huge growth. We're seeing stabilization. And Jack, I think it's fair to say, Bob, that one of the things we were conscious was a lot of commentary about how significantly things we're getting in terms of being worse. And as you know, we've been out for some time, calling for no year-end budget flush, constrained capital environment. We came into the year actually guiding for a slower growth in the second half. So what we're trying to intimate in the call today is what we've been saying for the last several quarters is exactly what we're seeing right now. And I thought -- we thought a proof point was the book-to-bill -- listen, it's not great out there in terms of robust growth, but the sky is also not falling either. But I think we saw some trends too that we're starting to see, PFAS is also now driving some testing in the food marketplace as well as every country that we talk to is in the process of further enhancing their own reg. So we wanted to have some other areas of potential growth for the company beyond the story around pharma. I think pursuant to Padraig and Bob, kind of the same rates, right, no significant improvement. Sure. Bob, maybe we'll tag team on this, which was -- I think the -- relative to the order book, I think we were slightly above revenue for the quarter. No really unusual pacing through the quarter from China. We've been calling -- I know a lot of our conversation today has been about pharma, but we've been saying for some quarters overall for China, it's been a broad-based slowdown. And that's what the business has been, and that's how we ended the year in terms of the end market performance. I will say that we were pleased that we were in line with our expectations for the business. So again, we described earlier that the business was moving along at a certain overall level. I think we do have a view of China that we will still be down in terms of the revenue for the year. But reflective of where we are, where we're seeing the business right now. So\u2026 So how about Bob lead here a few comments. And then I've been dying to pull Phil in on here as well. And maybe talk about some of the things he's seen on the Advanced Materials side, which is a real area of expertise for him, so. But I think your word of tail of 2 cities is really quite appropriate, both in terms of breakout by segment, also by geography. I think we posted 70% growth, if I remember correctly, in China last year. So I mean that's a tough comp. I don't care who you are. But we're seeing continued slowness on the C&E side. Our major customers here are really conservative in terms of their deployment of capital. Many of our largest customers are on cost control. So that's been -- that's what you're seeing reflected in the numbers, and that's why we expect a constrained outlook on that side of the business for a while. The different story on the Advanced Materials, and I think Bob, you pointed to good growth geographically globally outside of China.  And then Phil, I know you and the team got a whole bunch of initiatives around the applied markets, particularly not only PFAS but Advanced Materials. And I thought a good opportunity for me to introduce you to the audience and have you share your perspective on what we're doing on the applied on the Advanced Materials side. Great question, Bob. Yes, I think first of all, just to remind the audience, when we talk about the genomics mix business, what are we talking about? We got a $500 million business, probably 50% of it is in QA/QC instrumentation, where we are the undisputed leader here, a lot of appetite to invest here. Our TapeStation product, particularly the consumables business is on fire right now. Capital side is constrained as we've seen across the marketplace. And then I think we all believe in the view that NGS will continue to be a growth market for us. And for the industry, I think that people are dying on back their expectations about how robust it is for a period of time. And I think we're seeing that in our business. So why do we make some of the structure changes we made in the portfolio because we want to ensure that we've got the ability to have a healthy P&L while at the same point in time invest in growth. So there's a reallocation of R&D dollars happening as a result of some of the changes we made that we talked about over the call. So answer the story is we have a lot of appetite for focused investments in areas where we think we can win in genomics."

But on the applied market side and certainly around Advanced Materials. We're certainly relatively strong in those markets, and we're seeing good really good generation around the batteries market. And of course, we've spoken about the onshoring process around there in the Advanced Materials area. So globally, that obviously comes into the onshoring.

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja. Parmeet, please go ahead.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, Bo, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Mike and Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of the Agilent Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our third quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted currency exchange rates. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. In today's call, I'll walk you through our Q3 results, share what we're now seeing in the market and provide context for our revised full year outlook. I'll then turn things over to Bob for more detail on the quarter and outlook before returning for some brief closing comments. The Agilent team continues to execute well as we navigate our way through ongoing challenges of the current market environment. Our Q3 revenue was $1.67 billion at the top end of our expectations. This is a decline of 2% on a core basis against a tough compare of 13% in Q3 of last year. We continue to be proactive and are taking steps to help us deliver on our leveraged earnings model. Operating margins are 29.3%, up 180 basis points. Quarterly earnings per share of $1.43 are up 7% and above our expectations. The major drive behind our Q3 year-on-year decline in revenue is our China business. Excluding China, the rest of Agilent grew 2%, which was better than expected. We knew we're up against a difficult compare in China and had previously guided for lower China revenues in Q3. However, the economy in China continued to weaken during the quarter, translated into a more challenging market environment than we had anticipated. With the softer market conditions in China and continued global macroeconomic challenges, we have lower growth expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. We now expect core growth for the full year to be around 1%, down from our previous guide. Based on what we're seeing at this time, we're not assuming any improvement in the China market for the remainder of the year. We, however, view the near-term challenges we're experiencing as transitory and remain confident about the long-term growth prospects of our end markets. Before turning now to our third quarter results, I'd like to touch on our two largest end markets. Our total pharma business is down 8%, driven by the pharma market in China being down 30%. Within pharma, our biopharma business grew 5%, while small molecule was down 16%. The Chemical Advanced Materials market declined 3% versus a 22% increase last year. While we did see the chemical energy space being weighed down by macro concerns, slowing growth in Advanced Materials was more a function of a difficult compare as the volumes have remained steady and robust. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets have delivered revenues of $927 million. This was a decline of 9% of a very tough compare of 18% growth. Last year's growth was helped by the benefit of recovery from the Q2 2022 Shanghai shutdown. LSAG's performance continues to be affected by the market environment in China across all end markets and pharma globally. Our sales funnel remains healthy and are up year-on-year, but deal velocity continues to slow as customers remain cautious in making capital purchases. We expect this market environment for new instrument purchases to continue for the rest of the year. At this time, we are not assuming any benefit from a year-end budget flush or incremental stimulus in China. As we said before, we are continuing to prioritize invest in innovation. As an example, in June, Agilent's investment innovation were on full display at the Annual ASMS Conference. The LSAG team introduced new products and comprehensive workflows to enhance data quality and productivity for our customers. These include two new LC/MS systems, a new PFAS workflow solution and an AI software for data analysis, among others. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $396 million. This is up an impressive 11% core with growth in all regions and end markets, as customers continue to embrace our value proposition. We continue to see strong demand for our services as we help customers drive productivity in the lab. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $349 million, up 3% core. Pathology grew high single digits as demand for our diagnostic test continues to grow. Our NASD business grew high teens. This growth was partially offset as we are continuing to see market weakness for our Genomics and Resolution Bioscience businesses. Regarding resolution Bioscience, the market for kidded NGS-based companion diagnostics has not developed as we expected. Furthermore, we don't see a realistic path to profitability. As a result, we've made a difficult decision to shut down the business. However, our investments in future growth continue. For example, we achieved an important milestone during the quarter when our NASD business generated the first revenues from our Train B investment in Frederick, Colorado. Now looking forward for the company, as we navigate this challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in the Agilent team and our ability to continue driving leverage earnings growth, use our agile Agilent framework. We faced challenges before, and we're taking actions now that will make us stronger and position us well for the future. As we stated last quarter, we are doubling down on delivering cost efficiencies and increasing productivity. The goal is to generate additional cost savings so we can continue to invest in innovative new solutions and support for our customers as we enable future profitable growth. We are on track to achieve the cost savings we've targeted for the second half of this year. We are in attractive markets that will produce long-term growth. Our innovation engine remains strong and the battle test at One Agilent team is driving outstanding execution. Bob and I will provide the details on our results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back to provide some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you.\nRobert McMahon: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated guidance for the full year and our fourth quarter outlook. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Q3 revenue was $1.67 billion, a decline of 2.3% core and down 2.7% on a reported basis. This compares with 13.2% core growth last year. Currency was a 0.5 point headwind while M&A contribution was minimal. As you may recall, Q3 of last year benefited from roughly $35 million in revenue deferred from the second quarter as we ramp back up from the Shanghai shutdown in China. Accounting for this, our Q3 core growth would be roughly flat versus a year ago. As Mike mentioned, Pharma, our largest end market, declined 8%. This is in line with our reduced expectations coming out of Q2 with underperformance in China, offset by better performance in the rest of the world. The Chemicals and Advanced Materials market was down 3% off a very tough 22% compare, but dollar-wise was flat sequentially. The academia and government market was up 5% and with all regions showing growth except the Americas, which was flat. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in pathology, partially offset by genomics weakness. The environmental and forensics business grew 2%, driven by double-digit growth in the Americas and Europe. The growth was generated by the build-out of water infrastructure projects and an expansion of funding for PFAS-related activities. The food market grew 1% based on strength in Asia outside of China and mid-single-digit growth in Europe, driven by new food testing regulations. On a geographic basis, while China underperformed, the Americas and the rest of Asia were better than expected, while Europe was in line with our expectations. Moving down the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 56.3%, down 10 basis points from a year ago. Like last quarter, this was largely due to the product and services mix, and pricing was slightly better than our expectations. Below gross margin, the expense reduction actions we initiated in the second quarter helped strengthen operating margins. We also benefited from a reduction in variable pay expenses. As Mike mentioned, margins were 29.3%, up 180 basis points from last year. Below the line, our interest income was higher than planned, while our tax rate was 13.75% and we had 295 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.43, up 7% from a year ago, a very good result given declining revenue. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. I continue to be pleased with our cash flow generation this year. Cash flow from operations was $562 million in the quarter, and is $1.3 billion year-to-date. In Q3, we invested $81 million in capital expenditures, totaling $214 million year-to-date, effectively flat year-on-year as we continue to optimize our CapEx spending. Given the strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our free cash flow forecast for the year to $1.2 billion, comprised of operating cash flow of $1.5 billion and CapEx of $300 million. This is an increase of $250 million from the midpoint of our previous guidance. Despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, our balanced capital allocation strategy is intact. During the quarter, we returned $401 million to shareholders. $66 million through dividends and repurchase shares worth $335 million. This ongoing balanced approach to capital deployment is another example of the confidence we have in our team and our belief in the long-term strength of our markets. Before getting into the revised full year outlook, I want to mention we have taken a $291 million pretax charge in Q3 associated with the decision to shut down the Resolution Bioscience business. This charge, which is excluded from non-GAAP results, includes an impairment write-down along with charges associated with the wind-down and exit of the business. We expect the wind down to continue through Q4 and into early FY '24. Now to the revised outlook for the year in Q4. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment we are seeing, particularly in China, we now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $6.80 billion to $6.85 billion. This represents a decline of 0.7% to flat on a reported basis and core growth of 0.8% to 1.5%. This is a core growth reduction of 260 basis points from the midpoint of our last guide. Roughly 85% of the change is related to reduced expectations in China while the remainder is due to some incremental cautiousness from our customers on CapEx spend as well as softness in genomics and the shutdown of Resolution Bioscience. As Mike said earlier, we are not assuming any incremental stimulus in China or any material year-end budget flush in these revised projections. Given the large change in China, I wanted to provide some additional perspective on how we are forecasting the rest of the year, recognizing that the market continues to be very dynamic. To provide some context, in Q3 through June, our business in China was tracking to a mid-single-digit decline in revenue, which was in line with our expectations. However, in July, we saw a further deterioration in China, resulting in the 17% decline for the quarter. And while the Q3 decline in China was centered in pharma, which was down 30%, we did see weakness in the other end markets as well. We expect the conditions we've seen in July to persist in China for Q4. In addition, we are facing our most difficult quarterly compare in China, where we grew 44% in Q4 of last year. We are now expecting Q4 to decline in the mid-30s year-on-year. For the full year, we are expecting China to decline mid-single digits versus growing mid-single digits. With the change in revenue, we now expect full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.43, representing leveraged earnings growth of 3% to 4% and roughly 6% to 7% growth net of currency. The change in full year guide results in Q4 revenue being in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.705 billion. This represents a decline of 8% to 10.5% on a reported basis and a decline of 9.5% to 12% on a core basis. The recovery last year in Q4 of the remaining revenue deferred from the Shanghai Q2 shutdown negatively impacts the year-on-year results by roughly 1 point. In fourth quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36. Thanks for being on the call. And now I will turn things back over to Mike for some closing comments before taking your questions. Mike?\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Bob. While today's macroenvironment is challenged for new instrument purchases, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of our end markets, the diversification of our business and in our proven ability to grow faster than the market. I'd like to share a few examples why my confidence remains intact despite near-term challenges. In Pharma, our largest end market, innovation and advance of medicines continue with new therapeutics flowing into the market. The demographic drivers of this market are on our side, a growing global population that expects access to health care and extending life expectancy to be key priorities from their governments. Our market-leading solutions are critical to innovation behind new therapeutics and ensuring the safety and quality of on-market drugs. In the applied markets, growing PFAS testing and the electrical vehicle transition are here to stay, action in new opportunities for growth. Everyone wants to have a safer water to drink, food to eat and air to breathe and the search for and production of more sustainable materials and energy sources remains a global priority. Agilent is a diversified leader in a unique position to help our customers drive their solutions. We remain a trusted partner, our customers though they can rely on in both good and challenging times. Our combination of leading instrumentation and world-class customer support is a long-term competitive advantage. At the heart of this long-term competitive advantage is the Agilent team and the One Agilent culture. You see this reflected in a recent recognition on Glassdoor and in being named A Great Place to Work in all 27 countries and territories around the world where we qualify for certification. We have a company mission focused on advancing the quality of life. To learn more about this, I would encourage you to review the latest addition of the ESG report that we issued last month. We have proactively managed the company through the short term, always with an eye towards our customers and in the long term. We have been proactive in managing our business to drive leveraged earnings but not at the expense of customer satisfaction and future growth. Yes, these are challenging times, but we have the team, the strategy and the right culture that would deliver long-term success. Thank you for joining us today. And now over to you, Parmeet, to lead the question-and-answer session. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Mike. Bo, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.\nOperator: Thank you, Parmeet. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this afternoon to Matt Sykes at Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Sykes: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I thought maybe I'd start just with China, sort of a high-level question. You guys talked about sort of the transitory impact of the current environment. You mentioned pharma. Could you kind of extend those comments to China? Do you think it's more cyclical versus structural? Are there competitive issues that you're facing or just your outlook on that region? Thanks.\nMike McMullen: Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. So let me start with the last part of your question. This is a macro story, not a competitive story. So market shares continue to be very, very strong. I know there's a lot of discussion about increased local competition, but we've moved pretty aggressively on our made in China strategy. So we don't see that all as a competitive issue. Transitory, the comment there is really about the fact that the China market is not going away. It's going to be a big market for years to come. It clearly is challenged right now. And we're not -- we're taking a sort of one quarter at a time, actually month by month. And as Bob mentioned in his comments, I think July, we actually saw the weakest performance within the quarter, and we're still seeing weakness in the pharmaceutical industry, for example, the level of manufacturing declined pretty specifically in the month of July. So we think the market is going to be there, but it's going to take a while for it to get back to growth. And I guess probably the other thing to point here is - and again, I'm talking specifically around the instrument side of the China market. As you know, we have a very large, in fact, the largest installed base of instrumentation in the marketplace. So very positive on the ability to grow the aftermarket in our diagnostics business. Probably anything you add to that? Okay.\nMatt Sykes: Maybe just for my follow-up, just on ACG. So a good quarter in that business. And I know you guys talked about a year or two ago about sort of a goal of 30% plus margins obviously achieved this quarter. Can you maybe talk about sort of where you see the durability of that growth is sort of high single, low double, 30%-plus margins, how we should be thinking about the business? Or were there some one-offs in the quarter that you'd want to call out to kind of measure expectations there?\nMike McMullen: Yes. We've consistently communicated that we think this is a high single digit, low double-digit kind of growth business for us. It's been that way since pretty much most of my tenure as CEO, and we don't see that changing as we go forward. Of course, there'll be puts and takes by quarter. But we're continuing to see good growth in our connect rates, which we've talked a lot about. And we're also doing very well on winning the enterprise business as well to complement the other aspects of our portfolio offerings. I would say that the profitability was probably a little bit higher in Q3 than - but we do think that the high double-digit number you quote about is pretty manageable for that business, but not at the level we saw in Q3, right, Bob?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. Matt, this is Bob. And just maybe to further what Mike is saying, when we think about the components of that business, the fastest-growing component is actually the contracted business, which is that connect rate. And it was in the mid-teens this last quarter and continues to be faster growing than the overall business. And as long as we continue to be able to drive that increased attach rate, we feel very good about that. And that comes with - with that growth comes scale and being able to leverage our team with the work that the digital initiatives that we've had as well. And so as Mike said, don't book, I think it was 32% going forward because there were some variable pay true-ups. But certainly, what you've seen quarter in, quarter out is a nice, steady cadence of margin improvement there.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Jack Meehan at Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon, Jack.\nJack Meehan: Mike, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about some of the more cyclical areas of the business in the CAM segment. Just what are you seeing from some of your chemicals customers. You've heard some conversation of budget cuts there. Are you starting to see that? Just how is your visibility into some of these cyclical areas?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So as we've talked earlier - thanks for the question and Jack and comments and then have Jacob jump in on this one as well. But we look across the CAM, I'd say the Advanced Materials segment of that market, which we've communicated is more driven by secular trends and cyclical trends continues to hold up quite well. And by the way, also, I just want to point out we had a really tough compare, I think we grew 22% last year in Q3 in CAM. If we look at the chemicals and energy side of it, the energy side actually popped up a bit, particularly driven by the U.S. where we are seeing some weakness is in the chemical side where customers are looking at the macroeconomic environment and are slowing their capital investment there. So I'd say that kind of puts and takes. But I think in terms of the quarter, Bob, I think we came in right about where we thought we'd be in CAM and I'd say it's a mixed story in terms of different segments growing at different rates.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. Before Jacob, maybe you can jump in. I think the one thing that I think is important is you really have story in China, which is its own and then the rest of the business. And so if you think about where Americas and Europe is, it's performed extremely well. And if you actually look - we mentioned this in the call, sequentially, the dollars actually were very stable. And so we are expecting a challenging Q4, mainly because we grew 70% in China.\nMike McMullen: 43% in Q3.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. So it's a compare situation. But this business continues to be very strong.\nMike McMullen: Do you want to make the comments on the Advanced Materials side of the house there, Jacob?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, I can say that. And Mike, I think you also started with that saying that we continue to see a lot of activities in that space, especially in the battery space, where, of course, there are also compares we are against, but there's still a lot of interest in that space, and we are doing very, very well. Semicon is also cycling down right now, but we are - we continue to see business in that space, but not as strong as we did last year.\nJack Meehan: Thanks Jacob. And my follow-up, I wanted to ask about margins. Just how you're thinking about some of the puts and takes for 2024. I think some of the cost savings you've talked about should extend to next year, should get some leverage out of NASD. But at the same time, some of the performance comp comes back and would think some of these top line pressures extend as well. I don't know, can you just talk about maybe relative to the LRP, how you're thinking about margins for next year?\nMike McMullen: Bob, do you want to lead that one? Yes. By the way, one thing I'd add to that before Bob's, the specifics, Jack, is our decision on the Resolution Bioscience business so as part of the story for us next year in terms of margin expansion. So Bob?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. I would say that our view of leveraged earnings growth continues into '24. And so while we do have some things coming back to us, some of the actions that we've taken will continue to move into a full year for 2024. And quite honestly, that's kind of what we expect our job to be is to be able to drive that leveraged earnings growth.\nJack Meehan: Thank you, guys.\nMike McMullen: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. We go next now to Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Good job on the margin execution here, Mike. Mike, maybe I missed some of the comments here. Can you talk about the phasing in the quarter here in China? I think I heard when you start off down mid-singles and was July off like minus 25%, minus 30%, is that the exit rate?\nMike McMullen: Yes. We take a change within the quarter.\nRobert McMahon: Yes, Vijay, this is Bob. Your math is in the ballpark. Yes. So we were down mid-single digits through June. So May and June kind of tracking as we expected, and then we saw incremental weakness in July, and we ended up for the full quarter down 17%. And what we're assuming going into Q4 is that, that performance will continue into Q4. And given the tough comp that we have because I think we grew 44% in Q4 of last year, we're estimating roughly a 35-ish percent drop in Q4 in China.\nVijay Kumar: Sorry. That's helpful, Bob. And just -- sorry, where I was going with that question was, can you talk about capital versus recurring? And I think when I look at your Americas in Europe, America is just flattish. Do you see a similar sort of phasing in ex-China, maybe talk about exit rates in July?\nRobert McMahon: So actually, if you think about the ACG business, actually ACG grew in all regions and all end markets, inclusive of China. So there wasn't a change there. And I would say both in the Americas and Europe, we didn't see that same effect.\nMike McMullen: Yes. And overall, outside of China, the geographic performance was better than expected.\nRobert McMahon: Correct.\nMike McMullen: We saw no trends like the China trend in our other geographies.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Mike. And Mike, maybe one that you mentioned a couple of times on transitory. I think that's a new firm that you're using -- what have you heard - \nMike McMullen: I think I move away from prudent to transitory.\nVijay Kumar: Yes. What have you guys heard on the ground on China stimulus, maybe some positive commentary, but nothing is concrete and why use the word transitory is the implication here fiscal '24 should be a more normalized year when we look at the comps?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. So, a couple of thoughts here, I think relative to the China business, we're hearing similar things, but nothing really significant and there's not enough to go onto assume we have kind of material impact on our outlook for the rest of the year. When we talk about transitory, we talked about the fact that these markets are driven by investments to improve the human condition as I mentioned. They're not going to go away. And neither while we're not going to get into the specifics of an actual number, we actually see a path to growth next year for full year for Agilent. And of course, we have the tough compare the first half of next year, we did coming off a double-digit print for first half this year, but as we looked at our business keep in mind, we're - what's behind my thought process here which is - we're instrument company, yes, we have big instrument business around 60%, we have a 40% of those in recurring revenue business. I don't know if you caught it in Mike call script, but our sales funnel for instruments are actually growing. So that would say that at some point in time those budgets are going to be released and the orders will close, when I've seen deals come out of - the funnel. We're not seeing order cancellations, we're not seeing changes to our one loss ratio. And we're encouraged by the growth we're seeing in biopharma. On the small molecule side, we know that different rates of replacements during the cycles, but we think this will follow historical cycle. I think the real wildcard for us, we look forward into '24, is really what do we assume around the China market. We're not assuming any kind of major further degradation, but at the same point in time, it's the path to return to kind of historic growth rates. That's the open question right now.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Dan Leonard at Credit Suisse.\nMike McMullen: Hi, Dan.\nDan Leonard: Thank you. Hi, Mike. I wanted to follow-up on that last part. You've seen a lot of cycles in China over 30 plus years. What would you compare this to and how do we get out of it?\nMike McMullen: I am as old as the dirt and have been working in this marketplace since the mid-90s. I haven't seen a cycle like this before. And we've not seen a situation where the - there's really seem to be a lack of confidence right now in the macro economy. Now, look I'm not sharing - anything that the audience here doesn't fully understand already. So, the way we get out of this, I think is China led by the government. We'll get back to focusing on its long-term goals of making China an innovation driven economy, which will require continued investments in R&D. It's going to also get back to focusing on improving the health of - the population, addressing some of environment issue, so we think it's getting back to fundamentals. Yes, we think that eventually will occur, but there's a lot of issues that we may be work through within the China right now. But - it's a very large market, the market is not going to disappear. And I think there'll be investments. I think there's also needs to be a level of confidence in the private sector in China, that it's a good time to reinvest and maybe I shouldn't wait on the sidelines hope for its stimulus, but get back to work and get my business going. So there's a lot of dynamics. I really have to say though, I don't know if I have a comparable situation that we've been through for this long. I think Bob and I were talking earlier today. The change in the food ministry, a number of years ago is - was the biggest thing we've seen or 24 plus seven some of the biggest things we've seen a change, but this is much more of a macro economic issue in China, which is different than what we've seen before. Obviously, we have an impact on life sciences tool, but it's a much bigger macro story is really driving the softness right now in our markets.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. The only thing I would say, Dan to build on what Mike was saying is, as he mentioned, the demographics are with us when you think about the aging population, the need to actually access healthcare more important therapeutics, and the importance of ensuring the water and food supply. They are the world's leaders today in electric and clean energy. It's hard to believe when everyone thinks about that. But they are the leader, and they have more electric cars than any other region. And so, I think that investment is going to be key as Mike talking about from the government, but unless they changed their strategic priorities, I think that's the benefit for life sciences in general.\nDan Leonard: I appreciate all that perspective. And just a follow-up. I was hoping you could elaborate on your decision to shut down Res Bio. I was surprised by that, given that you acquired the company only a couple of years ago?\nMike McMullen: Yes, sure Dan. Happy to do so. So obviously, a very difficult decision, then I'll have Sam jump in on this conversation, but our fundamental belief was that our differentiation will be all around what we called the kitted strategy to have a distributed on market companion diagnostics for our pharma partners, and that market really hasn't developed as we had anticipated. Sam?\nSam Raha: Yes, Mike. Building on what you said, while NGS and cancer diagnostics is here and we serve that market in a number of ways, right, for just to be clear, too. We absolutely continue to serve cancer research translational research and diagnostic, test developer customers. But our core to our thesis, our differentiation is really the ability to develop and distribute these kitted tests in the market, the pharma market and the testing market just as evolve that way. And we also looked at our recent analysis and concluded that even with more additional investment, this is going to be a business that's going to be undergoing significant losses for some foreseeable future, so. It was a difficult, as Mike said, that the right decision to make this move now. But again to be clear, we continue to serve cancer research and diagnostics in a number of ways.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think - Sam, when we've talked about this in the past. So, we think we're still going be able to participate in what we believe the strong growth of liquid biopsy market. But to really providing a lot of the - if you will, ingredients for the test developers for themselves.\nSam Raha: Here and Mike. I'm going to take this opportunity to also just to say beyond our core SureSelect Target Enrichment portfolio which is used broadly for liquid biopsy testing today. Early next year, we'll be launching solutions from Avida BioMed, an acquisition that we announced earlier this year, which we think is really going to be a differentiated way to look at methylation, as well as classic mutation analysis.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. Maybe just one add, Dan, is obviously a difficult decision for us, but I also think it also looks - it shows the discipline that we have in terms of our portfolio rationalization, and we felt we had better returns in other places to invest in so.\nDan Leonard: Understood. Thanks for the time.\nMike McMullen: You're welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Brandon Couillard at Jefferies.\nBrandon Couillard: Hi, guys. Good afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon, Brandon.\nBrandon Couillard: Mike would you just find packing mass spec versus LC trends in the quarter? And then based on your revised guide, what is the four-year CAGR from 2019 for LSAG instruments exiting the year? How does that compare to historical average over the cycle?\nMike McMullen: Hi Brandon, I'm going to start with the response to your question. I'll let Bob dig through his notes to find the actual number. But first of all, I just started to say, is that we believe what we're dealing with here in our core instrument portfolio, inclusive of LC and LCMS continues to be a macro market story. Our market shares are holding up really well. We're seeing in our one loss data. We're seeing it in the external reports from order. And I think when we look at our performance in those core platforms versus our peers, we're reporting some numbers and kind of adjust for the timing of when we report. I think we're putting up similar kind of numbers. And Jacob, I know you looked at this thing pretty closely and I'm trying to buy some time for Bob to check down the...\nJacob Thaysen: We're trying to find the CAGR the last three years, which I don't have in front of me here, but you're right Mike, we follow this very accurately. And we're doing - we continue to do very well in this marketplace. We continue to innovate into it. And we have seen - actually, we have taken share over the last period of time. And if you actually compare our calendar two versus competition, would actually see that we are approximately flat in the LC, LCMS space. And I think that stacks up very well versus competition.\nRobert McMahon: Yes, hi Brandon, we can get that to you afterwards.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay.\nRobert McMahon: I can tell you though, if you looked at the LSAG business over the last three years, it's been averaging 5% CAGR, despite being forecasted to be down this year. And obviously, those are two large businesses.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. And then I guess, two housekeeping questions for you, Bob. You talked about NASD growth in the third quarter? I imagine it might have been up sequentially with Train B coming online and on the CapEx line. You pushed out $200 million you spend in that. Just roll into '24? There are some projects maybe you decided to defer from the time being - the environment?\nRobert McMahon: Yes, it's a great question. So NASD, we continue to be very pleased with that. We had our first revenue in Q3 from Train B, the first of many more revenues to come from that standpoint, and expect it to continue, and we're still on track for the numbers that we've been talking about through 50-plus for the full year. And in terms of the CapEx, some of that will roll forward, but it's not - we're not going to spend that $200 million in '24 as well. This would be - we have deferred projects being very rational, really focused on revenue-generating programs. And so, I do expect some of that will flow into '24, but I don't expect '24 to have an incremental $200 million show up in the forecast.\nBrandon Couillard: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Puneet Souda at Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: Hi Mike, Bob. Thanks for taking the questions.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nPuneet Souda: The first one, thanks. So maybe, Bob, could you elaborate a bit on pricing here? I know pricing was a meaningful contributor initially this year. We're seeing China, obviously, you talked quite a bit about it, and we're seeing the headline for China deflation. So wondering if you are expecting pricing to maintain there, or do you expect pricing pressure in China continuing? And also, we're seeing some of the peer sort of bioprocessing companies talking about local competition rising on the less high tech product. And so wondering if you're seeing that on any of - sort of your product lines as well?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. Let me take the second question first. We can compete against the Chinese local competitors each and every day. And nothing has changed from that standpoint. We continue to feel very good about our portfolio, and continue to drive that growth. In regards to pricing across the board, we were slightly better than what we had expected. It was roughly over - a little over 4% for the quarter. And that was driven across all three of the groups. So we continue to drive - positive price across not only our DGG and ACG business, but also our instrumentation and that's globally. And we expect to be able to continue to demonstrate the value of our instrumentation across the globe. Obviously, in a deflationary environment, that will put a little more pressure on the instrumentation business, particularly in China but we've incorporated that into, our forecast and are still on track for positive price contributions, for the full year in excess of 3%.\nMike McMullen: Hi Bob, maybe Bob or Padraig and also going to maybe comment on some discounting trends he may have been seeing?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No, I think - no, I think it's the pricing holds discounts has really held stable as well. We haven't seen any - increase in that rate of it, and we continue to monitor that, but it's been very stable, Mike.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Thanks for that. And then if I could ask an academic and government here, smaller segment for you, but it did solid in the quarter. Maybe could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing across the globe in different geographies for academic and government and your expectations here going forward? Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Yes, Bob, I think this is an end market that is holding up reasonably well. I mean we're seeing that on a global basis, in most cases, with the exception being China, where the funding is there, the funding is stable. And it's been a positive surprise for us so far through this year. And I don't...\nRobert McMahon: No, it's really across many of our instrument platforms as well as the service business. And from what we're seeing, Puneet, is funding continue to be available, and it's flowing from governments. I think they're seeing the strategic nature of many of the investments that they're making. And our expectation is that, that funding will continue.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. Super. Thank you.\nMike McMullen: You're welcome.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question. So first off, one of your peers have flagged that they were actually seeing some early signs of pharma spending recovery I appreciate that most of the incremental this quarter, is really related to the China weakness. So maybe ex-China, can you walk us through if you're seeing any signs of recovery of spending with biopharma customers. And then you've previously flagged for us that historically, when pharma spending slows down, like we're seeing today that it can take 12 to 24 months to recover. So how are you thinking about the timing, and recovery given the incremental weakness this quarter?\nMike McMullen: Sure, Rachel. So while we saw signs of stabilization in our European and U.S. business stabilization relative to expectations. We're not hearing anything along those lines yet in terms of recovery or desire to increase spending, the fact we're hearing the exact opposite right now from our large major pharma companies. So, I hope that commentary from others in this space is correct. And there's going to be a big recovery here from year-end, but we're not seeing any kind of indications of that. If it does happen, great. It would be upside relative to our current outlook, and we know we do well in these markets. But Padraig, I don't think we're seeing and hearing anything like along those lines.\nPadraig McDonnell: No, I think it's spot on, Mike.\nRobert McMahon: The only thing I would say, Rachel, is if we look at our funnels, they continue to be growing. So it's a question of when, not if, and particularly in pharma. And as Mike and Padraig just mentioned, we're not assuming a budget flush into our Q4. And if it happens, that would likely happen in our Q1 in any event, from a revenue perspective. But what we see at least from our funnels, is they continue to be helping. And let me just answer Brandon's question from a couple of times ago. If I look at LC and LCMS on a three-year CAGR, they're between 7% and 9%, so higher than the overall LSAG average.\nMike McMullen: Right. Thanks for that and Bob. And Rachel, I think the second question relative to - I think you're referring to the small molecule replacement cycle. And as you know, coming probably at least for the last 12 to 18 months, we had been indicating that we were expecting to see a slowdown in the rate of replacement. And in fact, we've seen that occur this year. Actually, given the weakness in China even beyond our expectations with a minus 16% number overall in the quarter. That being said, we do stay with our view that these tend to be 18 to 24 months, 12 to 18-month cycles, and we'd expect that they'll start to see movement back towards a higher growth rate. And that's one of the reasons as we look into '24, we're saying some of these markets will start to turn as - the base cycle gets back to more of a growth phase in that cycle. And as we've mentioned earlier, we see that particularly in liquid chromatography is probably about a five percentage kind of growth market long-term.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. Thank you for all that color. Maybe just following up on your small molecule comments there. So small molecule declined 16% this quarter. So can you talk to us about how much of your China exposure is really tied to those small molecule workflows? And then what else is really driving incremental weakness on the small molecule side? We've heard of IRA pressuring some pharma decisions and potentially leading to them reprioritizing the pipeline. So is there any risk that you won't see a recovery? Or could the growth rate for small molecule really be reset in? What are your conversations with customers on that trend? Thank you.\nMike McMullen: Okay. So you got it. So relative to China, I would say it's probably the same ratio as the global business, right? That's probably what 60%, 65%?\nRobert McMahon: Yes.\nMike McMullen: Is probably related to a small molecule. And relative to what's happened in large pharma, what we're seeing is in medium-sized pharma is, again, a continuation of this cautious about deferring capital. I'm sure they're thinking through implications of iRNA also other expenses are running hotter in their P&Ls where they need to make some offsets with capital purchases. That being said, if you believe, and I know pharma believes the importance of having safe on-market drugs. You have to have the instrumentation QA/QC environment to support that. That requires you to have modern liquid chromatography fleets. So, I don't think it's a question that they can - that this market is going to go away and won't be an area that the pharma will need to invest in. You can defer for a period of time, but then only last for so long.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Patrick Donnelly at Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Mike, maybe just given that commentary around the instrument cycle, you're not really seeing much improvement yet. Obviously, the China piece transitory, but certainly seems like it's going to linger. You only a couple of months in '24 for you guys here. How do you think about some of these impacts lingering in? I think you said there's still plans for growth next year, but it certainly sounds like some of the headwinds at least will linger into the first half, given some of those costs. I just wanted to talk through that top line setup given some of these headwinds lingering into next year?\nMike McMullen: Yes. We still have a few more months so we finish off the fiscal year, and we'll give you our guide in November. And I think we'll know a lot more by then. But I do think we know that we'll be able to grow this company in '24. That said, I was very careful in my comments to make sure that there's a full year growth rate. We do expect the first half of the year to be a challenging year just from a comp standpoint to begin with, but also some of the things that we've been talking about today in the call, we don't expect a quick snapback to be occurring in the next quarter or 2.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful. And then I know you mentioned budget flush is still a little bit away from that at the calendar year event for pharma and other areas. Do you have any view at this point? It sounds like you guys are expecting to be a more subdued budget flush, but whatever you're hearing from customers would be helpful just to pull back a little bit more on that.\nMike McMullen: Yes, sure, Patrick, happy to do so, and then I'll invite Padraig to this conversation. I know he's been talking a lot to his team about this. But as I mentioned earlier, we're not really seeing any kind of indication of customers saying, hey, listen, I'm going to have money. I'm planning to spend it this way. In fact, we've seen the opposite where sometimes orders that we thought were closed to actually keep deferring and require more purchases. In fact, I think one story we heard was we probably 3x. Fondo CFO, approved it on the third go-around and the CEO overruled it. So we know eventually going to get that business. But this is kind of dynamics ever seen. So we're not seeing a lot of indications of a strong year-end budget flush. Again, we'd love to see the opposite happen, but we're not going to indication of that. And I don't if you have something to add there.\nPadraig McDonnell: What we're hearing from the customers is that we're not planning on a budget flow through the end of the year, but we're - we will take the upside of corsa.com. I think I think one thing is really clear that the funnels are very strong, and it's there, but we're not seeing them to be released through a big push at the end of the year.\nMike McMullen: I think this comment, Patrick, on the funnel being strong and these funnels are actually growing is really important because this is one of the reasons why we think about full year outlook in '24. We know the business is there. It's just a question of when it's going to get - \nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. We watch very closely our win loss rates. And we haven't - we've seen them very, very stable -- we had a strong funnel, which is very positive over time.\nPatrick Donnelly: Understood. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Derik De Bruin at Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: Hi. Good afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon, Derik.\nDerik De Bruin: A lot of what I wanted to ask has been asked, so I've got some cleanups here. Just did you give a specific instrument core growth number in consumables growth or number for 3Q and then sort of your all-in number for this year, what you're expecting?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. We didn't. LSAG for Q3 was down roughly 9% core. Consumables was up slightly.\nDerik De Bruin: Got it. Thank you. So what's the revenue contribution for Res Bio in 4Q? And what do we need to pull out for 2024?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. So we've got a minimal number in Q4 as we wind down the business. And I would say it was roughly 1 point to a little over 1 point to the headwind to DGG going forward in FY '24.\nDerik De Bruin: Got it. Okay. And so staying on the topic of M&A. I mean, you've done a couple of genomics deals, which haven't gone your way. And I'm just sort of wondering what's your thinking about deployment going forward? I mean valuations have obviously come in, industry is consolidating, you would say, but we have -- it's been relatively quiet across the space for the last 18 months. And so like how are you sort of thinking about capital deployment? And at what point do you decide you maybe want to buy -- start maybe doing even with the share prices, maybe doing some share buybacks. You sort of talk about your general capital deployment strategy at this moment?\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think Bob alluded to it a bit in his prepared remarks, but we still are staying with our balanced capital allocation strategy, and you saw us in the market opportunistically on share repurchases given where we saw the share price setting that. In terms of our - an appetite for M&A, it remains unchanged given - despite the Resolution Bioscience decision. We knew that was a higher risk acquisition for us, early-stage company in hot area based on a really differentiating strategy that didn't want this to play out. But we've had some success in other aspects of our genomics acquisitions, including the AAT acquisition on the instrumentation side. So we're still out there looking. But as Bob mentioned, we take a disciplined approach to not only to how we view our internal choices and our internal business performance in terms of what's in the portfolio, but we'll also take that same lens, if you will, on how we look at M&A. So really, nothing has changed beyond the fact that this is more of a buyer's market. And companies with a strong balance sheet like Agilent, I think they're in a good favorable position to work on opportunities, but we're going to stay disciplined and not get caught up in what once was a value of a company, either in the private or public space.\nDerik De Bruin: Just one more follow-up, if I may. What are your orders in liquid chromatography? How is your order book? Are you seeing orders increasing?\nRobert McMahon: Our order book was down, largely a function of China, but they were down year-on-year.\nDerik De Bruin: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Josh Waldman at Cleveland Research.\nJosh Waldman: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for you. First, Bob, can you provide more context on the puts and takes within the fourth quarter core organic growth guide? I guess maybe the assumptions by business unit. And then curious what areas or in markets outside of China seem to be like slowing real time that you're trying to reflect in the guide versus areas that maybe have stabilized or improving over the last few days.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. So Josh, just real quick. When we think about kind of the Q4 implied guide, the big driver is China. As I mentioned, down roughly mid-30s and that really impacts a number of markets you can imagine, both AR and chemical and energy, which are - or chemical and advanced materials, which are the two largest markets in China. I would also say that the diagnostics and clinical is also down. We've seen that softness in genomics. And then obviously, the shutdown of Res Bio also impacts that business, and that's primarily a U.S. phenomenon. So we did see an impact in U.S. on that side. And then there's some puts and takes in other places, but those are the two big pieces for Q4.\nMike McMullen: But as I recall, I think 85% of the change was really China driven and bleeds over into pharma in CAM.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Okay. Then Mike, I guess, staying on China and a follow-up there. Can you unpack a bit more of what you're seeing by end market? I mean, like where demand is holding in versus like areas that you've seen come in lighter as the quarter progressed again. I guess, outside of China - sorry, outside of pharma. And then I guess, a follow-up on Dan's question. I believe it was earlier. What are the variables within China, Mike that you're trying to account for as you forecast the medium term? I mean, maybe beyond just the next couple of months. And I guess any risk that we need to kind of rethink, the underlying growth rate in the industry if China remains light here in the medium term?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So let me start with the view by end market. I think the academia and government market was - grew for us in the third quarter. But everything else was pretty much down. The big change really were in the pharma space. And as Bob commented earlier about how we exited the quarter, the July performance. Some weakness in chemicals, but I'd say the down there was really just a byproduct of - we're going off of 43% compared last year. And we're looking at a 70% growth compare in the fourth quarter. But I'd say the concerns or the cost of this in the China marketplace is really across the board. And with varying degrees, but I think it's really most reflected in the pharma outlook. I think that's a $64,000 question. I think there's a case to be made that this market will get back to its longer-term growth rates, but it will take a period of years to get there. It's not going to be a snapback in 12 months. But again, that's work to be done. The factors that we're looking at, I think are the same factors that everybody else is staring at, which is what's going to happen to the macro in China. Storyboard here is a macro story and is bleeding over into life science tools, but we need to see the China economy get moving again. We need to see consumer confidence coming back. We need to see investment commerce is coming back in China. I think those things will take some time. But I do think there are priorities of the government, and they'll find a way to make that happen. But we're not calling for a quick snapback here either.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Appreciate guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Dan Brennan at TD Cowen.\nDan Brennan: Great guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just one on instruments, Bob, I think you talked earlier, I think to Derik's question maybe you gave the L segment, but I know there's consumables within that. Could you just break out what the instrument number is? I know we've got on the Q. Just wondering how instrument did and as we look ahead, I think given your instrument exposure, it's always a key question, I know there's been various times asked throughout, but just how would we think about kind of the outlook for instrument, whether it be fourth quarter, if you want to point to go out a little further?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. So to maybe add a little more flavor and clarity to my answer previously, LSAG was down 9% core. It was down 9% in instruments as well. So the consumables business was up basically a point.\nDan Brennan: And as we look out there, I'm just wondering. I guess it's really depends upon that - the type of product, which you guys already discussed, it sounds like you're optimistic on LSAG given the funnel is going to get back towards that excuse me LCMS is going to get back to that 5% growth. I guess, would you assume instruments as a starting point growth in fiscal '24 for what you see today?\nMike McMullen: Based on what we see today, yes.\nDan Brennan: Got it. I mean one more, quick one just on - yes\u2026\nRobert McMahon: There's no reason to believe when we think about kind of the level of investment over-time. And the importance of our instruments in the Discovery of new therapeutic areas or food testing, we think about as Mike was talking about these new areas around Applied Markets, there's no reason to think that there is something fundamentally has changed, that they don't need instrumentation. And so, I think we feel very good about our market-share and our good about our market-share, and our competitiveness and do expect our LSAG business to be a growth driver for us going forward. Yes, no completely. No, is this more just on the comp basis, after making\u2026\nDan Brennan: That sounds great. Bob and just one quick one, just on - the applied versus the chemical, you mentioned some chemical weakening just that were concerned during the quarter, but the applied obviously powering through. Can you just maybe unpack a little bit more how you're thinking about like how we exit the year across your different buckets within the chemical and applied segment?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. I mean, I think if you look at Q4, it will be really an impact of China. So we're actually looking at chemical and advanced materials declining in Q4, because of that 70% increase that Mike mentioned in Q4 of last year. That was across-the-board. I would say the advanced materials will be much stronger than that down high or down double-digits. And the chemical side, probably we will have a bigger impact. If you recall, the Shanghai shutdown impact was centered in the chemical and advanced materials market, because that's where our GC manufacturing was and that's a Workhorse for some of those products. So, we do see it down in Q4, but up for the full-year. I think that's a really important to make sure that people understand.\nDan Brennan: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have time for one more question this afternoon, we'll take that now from Luke Sergott at Barclays.\nLuke Sergott: Great. Thanks for squeezing me in.\nMike McMullen: Hi Luke.\nLuke Sergott: Just real quick on the - thanks. So real quick on NASD. But are you guys seeing any pressure from the market, seeing any in-sourcing from the market? I know Novartis has talked about doing some of this as well. And then lastly additionally, with that with the CapEx guide down. Are you guys still investing in additional lines there for the year? Or is that really on pause is that have anything to do with that kind of CapEx stepped down?\nMike McMullen: Let me leave it there. And then have Bob jump-in and Sam as well, but from in-sourcing standpoint. No, we're not seeing any material moves in this direction. And in fact as we head into '24, we continue to broaden our book of business and we're going to have more customers overhead in terms of breadth of customers as we go into '24. And yes, it's called Project Endeavor. So Train B we went live, which we had a different code-named. And that's live, but we continue to move forward with our expansion plans on the other front, siRNA front, along with what we like to do on the CRISPR side as well And antisense. So, we're going to broaden that. So our stated investment plans remain unchanged.\nRobert McMahon: Yes, to be very clear, Luke, to add what Mike said, we are not slowing that down at all. That investment is one of the highest priorities, we've trimmed back spending in another less more infrastructure kind of oriented projects as opposed to kind of revenue-generating. I think what you're seeing actually is it's actually coming in better-than-expected, because the pricing is better-than-expected and you probably have seen that in other places. And so, the availability of parts and the key materials is better than what we had initially planned as well.\nSam Raha: Yes, I only add to what you guys said that Mike along with having more customers and actually more diversified set of customers, we're going to be we're contracted to do more programs next year than in the history of NASD. So it's a yes, all full-speed ahead.\nLuke Sergott: Got you. Got you. And then I didn't - hear anybody asked about the ACG margin, maybe they did I missed it, but you guys had a material step-up there, can you talk about really what went on there, is that - is there any benefit that you saw from Mike lack of incentive comp just kind of break-out, where the drivers there and really how we should think about that in Q4, and as a jump-off point?\nMike McMullen: Yes, we did mention that there was a benefit, Luke, of the variable pay comp, obviously, that's got a big component of people in it, but it's also a reflection of the scale and - continued growth of that business. We didn't say take that 32% I believe it was in Q3 and kind of book that as the new starting point. Because it had outsized growth. But we continue to be pleased and expect continued margin expansion for ACG going-forward.\nLuke Sergott: All right, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time I would like to turn things back to Parmeet Ahuja for any closing comments.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks Bo, and thanks everyone for joining the call today. With that, we'd like to end the call. Have a good day everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, Parmeet. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. Thank you for joining. We wish you all a great day. Goodbye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated guidance for the full year and our fourth quarter outlook. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Q3 revenue was $1.67 billion, a decline of 2.3% core and down 2.7% on a reported basis. This compares with 13.2% core growth last year. Currency was a 0.5 point headwind while M&A contribution was minimal. As you may recall, Q3 of last year benefited from roughly $35 million in revenue deferred from the second quarter as we ramp back up from the Shanghai shutdown in China. Accounting for this, our Q3 core growth would be roughly flat versus a year ago. As Mike mentioned, Pharma, our largest end market, declined 8%. This is in line with our reduced expectations coming out of Q2 with underperformance in China, offset by better performance in the rest of the world. The Chemicals and Advanced Materials market was down 3% off a very tough 22% compare, but dollar-wise was flat sequentially. The academia and government market was up 5% and with all regions showing growth except the Americas, which was flat. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in pathology, partially offset by genomics weakness. The environmental and forensics business grew 2%, driven by double-digit growth in the Americas and Europe. The growth was generated by the build-out of water infrastructure projects and an expansion of funding for PFAS-related activities. The food market grew 1% based on strength in Asia outside of China and mid-single-digit growth in Europe, driven by new food testing regulations. On a geographic basis, while China underperformed, the Americas and the rest of Asia were better than expected, while Europe was in line with our expectations. Moving down the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 56.3%, down 10 basis points from a year ago. Like last quarter, this was largely due to the product and services mix, and pricing was slightly better than our expectations. Below gross margin, the expense reduction actions we initiated in the second quarter helped strengthen operating margins. We also benefited from a reduction in variable pay expenses. As Mike mentioned, margins were 29.3%, up 180 basis points from last year. Below the line, our interest income was higher than planned, while our tax rate was 13.75% and we had 295 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.43, up 7% from a year ago, a very good result given declining revenue. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. I continue to be pleased with our cash flow generation this year. Cash flow from operations was $562 million in the quarter, and is $1.3 billion year-to-date. In Q3, we invested $81 million in capital expenditures, totaling $214 million year-to-date, effectively flat year-on-year as we continue to optimize our CapEx spending. Given the strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our free cash flow forecast for the year to $1.2 billion, comprised of operating cash flow of $1.5 billion and CapEx of $300 million. This is an increase of $250 million from the midpoint of our previous guidance. Despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, our balanced capital allocation strategy is intact. During the quarter, we returned $401 million to shareholders. $66 million through dividends and repurchase shares worth $335 million. This ongoing balanced approach to capital deployment is another example of the confidence we have in our team and our belief in the long-term strength of our markets. Before getting into the revised full year outlook, I want to mention we have taken a $291 million pretax charge in Q3 associated with the decision to shut down the Resolution Bioscience business. This charge, which is excluded from non-GAAP results, includes an impairment write-down along with charges associated with the wind-down and exit of the business. We expect the wind down to continue through Q4 and into early FY '24. Now to the revised outlook for the year in Q4. Given the more challenging macroeconomic environment we are seeing, particularly in China, we now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $6.80 billion to $6.85 billion. This represents a decline of 0.7% to flat on a reported basis and core growth of 0.8% to 1.5%. This is a core growth reduction of 260 basis points from the midpoint of our last guide. Roughly 85% of the change is related to reduced expectations in China while the remainder is due to some incremental cautiousness from our customers on CapEx spend as well as softness in genomics and the shutdown of Resolution Bioscience. As Mike said earlier, we are not assuming any incremental stimulus in China or any material year-end budget flush in these revised projections. Given the large change in China, I wanted to provide some additional perspective on how we are forecasting the rest of the year, recognizing that the market continues to be very dynamic. To provide some context, in Q3 through June, our business in China was tracking to a mid-single-digit decline in revenue, which was in line with our expectations. However, in July, we saw a further deterioration in China, resulting in the 17% decline for the quarter. And while the Q3 decline in China was centered in pharma, which was down 30%, we did see weakness in the other end markets as well. We expect the conditions we've seen in July to persist in China for Q4. In addition, we are facing our most difficult quarterly compare in China, where we grew 44% in Q4 of last year. We are now expecting Q4 to decline in the mid-30s year-on-year. For the full year, we are expecting China to decline mid-single digits versus growing mid-single digits. With the change in revenue, we now expect full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.40 and $5.43, representing leveraged earnings growth of 3% to 4% and roughly 6% to 7% growth net of currency. The change in full year guide results in Q4 revenue being in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.705 billion. This represents a decline of 8% to 10.5% on a reported basis and a decline of 9.5% to 12% on a core basis. The recovery last year in Q4 of the remaining revenue deferred from the Shanghai Q2 shutdown negatively impacts the year-on-year results by roughly 1 point. In fourth quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.33 and $1.36. Thanks for being on the call. And now I will turn things back over to Mike for some closing comments before taking your questions. Mike? Yes. Matt, this is Bob. And just maybe to further what Mike is saying, when we think about the components of that business, the fastest-growing component is actually the contracted business, which is that connect rate. And it was in the mid-teens this last quarter and continues to be faster growing than the overall business. And as long as we continue to be able to drive that increased attach rate, we feel very good about that. And that comes with - with that growth comes scale and being able to leverage our team with the work that the digital initiatives that we've had as well. And so as Mike said, don't book, I think it was 32% going forward because there were some variable pay true-ups. But certainly, what you've seen quarter in, quarter out is a nice, steady cadence of margin improvement there. Yes. Before Jacob, maybe you can jump in. I think the one thing that I think is important is you really have story in China, which is its own and then the rest of the business. And so if you think about where Americas and Europe is, it's performed extremely well. And if you actually look - we mentioned this in the call, sequentially, the dollars actually were very stable. And so we are expecting a challenging Q4, mainly because we grew 70% in China. Yes. So it's a compare situation. But this business continues to be very strong. Yes. I would say that our view of leveraged earnings growth continues into '24. And so while we do have some things coming back to us, some of the actions that we've taken will continue to move into a full year for 2024. And quite honestly, that's kind of what we expect our job to be is to be able to drive that leveraged earnings growth. Yes, Vijay, this is Bob. Your math is in the ballpark. Yes. So we were down mid-single digits through June. So May and June kind of tracking as we expected, and then we saw incremental weakness in July, and we ended up for the full quarter down 17%. And what we're assuming going into Q4 is that, that performance will continue into Q4. And given the tough comp that we have because I think we grew 44% in Q4 of last year, we're estimating roughly a 35-ish percent drop in Q4 in China. So actually, if you think about the ACG business, actually ACG grew in all regions and all end markets, inclusive of China. So there wasn't a change there. And I would say both in the Americas and Europe, we didn't see that same effect. Correct. Yes. So, a couple of thoughts here, I think relative to the China business, we're hearing similar things, but nothing really significant and there's not enough to go onto assume we have kind of material impact on our outlook for the rest of the year. When we talk about transitory, we talked about the fact that these markets are driven by investments to improve the human condition as I mentioned. They're not going to go away. And neither while we're not going to get into the specifics of an actual number, we actually see a path to growth next year for full year for Agilent. And of course, we have the tough compare the first half of next year, we did coming off a double-digit print for first half this year, but as we looked at our business keep in mind, we're - what's behind my thought process here which is - we're instrument company, yes, we have big instrument business around 60%, we have a 40% of those in recurring revenue business. I don't know if you caught it in Mike call script, but our sales funnel for instruments are actually growing. So that would say that at some point in time those budgets are going to be released and the orders will close, when I've seen deals come out of - the funnel. We're not seeing order cancellations, we're not seeing changes to our one loss ratio. And we're encouraged by the growth we're seeing in biopharma. On the small molecule side, we know that different rates of replacements during the cycles, but we think this will follow historical cycle. I think the real wildcard for us, we look forward into '24, is really what do we assume around the China market. We're not assuming any kind of major further degradation, but at the same point in time, it's the path to return to kind of historic growth rates. That's the open question right now. Yes. The only thing I would say, Dan to build on what Mike was saying is, as he mentioned, the demographics are with us when you think about the aging population, the need to actually access healthcare more important therapeutics, and the importance of ensuring the water and food supply. They are the world's leaders today in electric and clean energy. It's hard to believe when everyone thinks about that. But they are the leader, and they have more electric cars than any other region. And so, I think that investment is going to be key as Mike talking about from the government, but unless they changed their strategic priorities, I think that's the benefit for life sciences in general. Yes. Maybe just one add, Dan, is obviously a difficult decision for us, but I also think it also looks - it shows the discipline that we have in terms of our portfolio rationalization, and we felt we had better returns in other places to invest in so. Yes, hi Brandon, we can get that to you afterwards. I can tell you though, if you looked at the LSAG business over the last three years, it's been averaging 5% CAGR, despite being forecasted to be down this year. And obviously, those are two large businesses. Yes, it's a great question. So NASD, we continue to be very pleased with that. We had our first revenue in Q3 from Train B, the first of many more revenues to come from that standpoint, and expect it to continue, and we're still on track for the numbers that we've been talking about through 50-plus for the full year. And in terms of the CapEx, some of that will roll forward, but it's not - we're not going to spend that $200 million in '24 as well. This would be - we have deferred projects being very rational, really focused on revenue-generating programs. And so, I do expect some of that will flow into '24, but I don't expect '24 to have an incremental $200 million show up in the forecast. Yes. Let me take the second question first. We can compete against the Chinese local competitors each and every day. And nothing has changed from that standpoint. We continue to feel very good about our portfolio, and continue to drive that growth. In regards to pricing across the board, we were slightly better than what we had expected. It was roughly over - a little over 4% for the quarter. And that was driven across all three of the groups. So we continue to drive - positive price across not only our DGG and ACG business, but also our instrumentation and that's globally. And we expect to be able to continue to demonstrate the value of our instrumentation across the globe. Obviously, in a deflationary environment, that will put a little more pressure on the instrumentation business, particularly in China but we've incorporated that into, our forecast and are still on track for positive price contributions, for the full year in excess of 3%. No, it's really across many of our instrument platforms as well as the service business. And from what we're seeing, Puneet, is funding continue to be available, and it's flowing from governments. I think they're seeing the strategic nature of many of the investments that they're making. And our expectation is that, that funding will continue. The only thing I would say, Rachel, is if we look at our funnels, they continue to be growing. So it's a question of when, not if, and particularly in pharma. And as Mike and Padraig just mentioned, we're not assuming a budget flush into our Q4. And if it happens, that would likely happen in our Q1 in any event, from a revenue perspective. But what we see at least from our funnels, is they continue to be helping. And let me just answer Brandon's question from a couple of times ago. If I look at LC and LCMS on a three-year CAGR, they're between 7% and 9%, so higher than the overall LSAG average. Yes. Yes. We didn't. LSAG for Q3 was down roughly 9% core. Consumables was up slightly. Yes. So we've got a minimal number in Q4 as we wind down the business. And I would say it was roughly 1 point to a little over 1 point to the headwind to DGG going forward in FY '24. Our order book was down, largely a function of China, but they were down year-on-year. Yes. So Josh, just real quick. When we think about kind of the Q4 implied guide, the big driver is China. As I mentioned, down roughly mid-30s and that really impacts a number of markets you can imagine, both AR and chemical and energy, which are - or chemical and advanced materials, which are the two largest markets in China. I would also say that the diagnostics and clinical is also down. We've seen that softness in genomics. And then obviously, the shutdown of Res Bio also impacts that business, and that's primarily a U.S. phenomenon. So we did see an impact in U.S. on that side. And then there's some puts and takes in other places, but those are the two big pieces for Q4. Yes. So to maybe add a little more flavor and clarity to my answer previously, LSAG was down 9% core. It was down 9% in instruments as well. So the consumables business was up basically a point. There's no reason to believe when we think about kind of the level of investment over-time. And the importance of our instruments in the Discovery of new therapeutic areas or food testing, we think about as Mike was talking about these new areas around Applied Markets, there's no reason to think that there is something fundamentally has changed, that they don't need instrumentation. And so, I think we feel very good about our market-share and our good about our market-share, and our competitiveness and do expect our LSAG business to be a growth driver for us going forward. Yes, no completely. No, is this more just on the comp basis, after making\u2026 Yes. I mean, I think if you look at Q4, it will be really an impact of China. So we're actually looking at chemical and advanced materials declining in Q4, because of that 70% increase that Mike mentioned in Q4 of last year. That was across-the-board. I would say the advanced materials will be much stronger than that down high or down double-digits. And the chemical side, probably we will have a bigger impact. If you recall, the Shanghai shutdown impact was centered in the chemical and advanced materials market, because that's where our GC manufacturing was and that's a Workhorse for some of those products. So, we do see it down in Q4, but up for the full-year. I think that's a really important to make sure that people understand. Yes, to be very clear, Luke, to add what Mike said, we are not slowing that down at all. That investment is one of the highest priorities, we've trimmed back spending in another less more infrastructure kind of oriented projects as opposed to kind of revenue-generating. I think what you're seeing actually is it's actually coming in better-than-expected, because the pricing is better-than-expected and you probably have seen that in other places. And so, the availability of parts and the key materials is better than what we had initially planned as well."

We absolutely continue to serve cancer research translational research and diagnostic, test developer customers. But our core to our thesis, our differentiation is really the ability to develop and distribute these kitted tests in the market, the pharma market and the testing market just as evolve that way. And we also looked at our recent analysis and concluded that even with more additional investment, this is going to be a business that's going to be undergoing significant losses for some foreseeable future, so. It was a difficult, as Mike said, that the right decision to make this move now. But again to be clear, we continue to serve cancer research and diagnostics in a number of ways. Here and Mike. I'm going to take this opportunity to also just to say beyond our core SureSelect Target Enrichment portfolio which is used broadly for liquid biopsy testing today. Early next year, we'll be launching solutions from Avida BioMed, an acquisition that we announced earlier this year, which we think is really going to be a differentiated way to look at methylation, as well as classic mutation analysis. Yes, I only add to what you guys said that Mike along with having more customers and actually more diversified set of customers, we're going to be we're contracted to do more programs next year than in the history of NASD. So it's a yes, all full-speed ahead."

Semicon is also cycling down right now, but we are - we continue to see business in that space, but not as strong as we did last year. We're trying to find the CAGR the last three years, which I don't have in front of me here, but you're right Mike, we follow this very accurately. And we're doing - we continue to do very well in this marketplace. We continue to innovate into it. And we have seen - actually, we have taken share over the last period of time. And if you actually compare our calendar two versus competition, would actually see that we are approximately flat in the LC, LCMS space. And I think that stacks up very well versus competition."

What we're hearing from the customers is that we're not planning on a budget flow through the end of the year, but we're - we will take the upside of corsa.com. I think I think one thing is really clear that the funnels are very strong, and it's there, but we're not seeing them to be released through a big push at the end of the year. Yes. We watch very closely our win loss rates. And we haven't - we've seen them very, very stable -- we had a strong funnel, which is very positive over time."

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. In today's call, I'll walk you through our Q3 results, share what we're now seeing in the market and provide context for our revised full year outlook. I'll then turn things over to Bob for more detail on the quarter and outlook before returning for some brief closing comments. The Agilent team continues to execute well as we navigate our way through ongoing challenges of the current market environment. Our Q3 revenue was $1.67 billion at the top end of our expectations. This is a decline of 2% on a core basis against a tough compare of 13% in Q3 of last year. We continue to be proactive and are taking steps to help us deliver on our leveraged earnings model. Operating margins are 29.3%, up 180 basis points. Quarterly earnings per share of $1.43 are up 7% and above our expectations. The major drive behind our Q3 year-on-year decline in revenue is our China business. Excluding China, the rest of Agilent grew 2%, which was better than expected. We knew we're up against a difficult compare in China and had previously guided for lower China revenues in Q3. However, the economy in China continued to weaken during the quarter, translated into a more challenging market environment than we had anticipated. With the softer market conditions in China and continued global macroeconomic challenges, we have lower growth expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. We now expect core growth for the full year to be around 1%, down from our previous guide. Based on what we're seeing at this time, we're not assuming any improvement in the China market for the remainder of the year. We, however, view the near-term challenges we're experiencing as transitory and remain confident about the long-term growth prospects of our end markets. Before turning now to our third quarter results, I'd like to touch on our two largest end markets. Our total pharma business is down 8%, driven by the pharma market in China being down 30%. Within pharma, our biopharma business grew 5%, while small molecule was down 16%. The Chemical Advanced Materials market declined 3% versus a 22% increase last year. While we did see the chemical energy space being weighed down by macro concerns, slowing growth in Advanced Materials was more a function of a difficult compare as the volumes have remained steady and robust. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Science and Applied Markets have delivered revenues of $927 million. This was a decline of 9% of a very tough compare of 18% growth. Last year's growth was helped by the benefit of recovery from the Q2 2022 Shanghai shutdown. LSAG's performance continues to be affected by the market environment in China across all end markets and pharma globally. Our sales funnel remains healthy and are up year-on-year, but deal velocity continues to slow as customers remain cautious in making capital purchases. We expect this market environment for new instrument purchases to continue for the rest of the year. At this time, we are not assuming any benefit from a year-end budget flush or incremental stimulus in China. As we said before, we are continuing to prioritize invest in innovation. As an example, in June, Agilent's investment innovation were on full display at the Annual ASMS Conference. The LSAG team introduced new products and comprehensive workflows to enhance data quality and productivity for our customers. These include two new LC/MS systems, a new PFAS workflow solution and an AI software for data analysis, among others. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $396 million. This is up an impressive 11% core with growth in all regions and end markets, as customers continue to embrace our value proposition. We continue to see strong demand for our services as we help customers drive productivity in the lab. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $349 million, up 3% core. Pathology grew high single digits as demand for our diagnostic test continues to grow. Our NASD business grew high teens. This growth was partially offset as we are continuing to see market weakness for our Genomics and Resolution Bioscience businesses. Regarding resolution Bioscience, the market for kidded NGS-based companion diagnostics has not developed as we expected. Furthermore, we don't see a realistic path to profitability. As a result, we've made a difficult decision to shut down the business. However, our investments in future growth continue. For example, we achieved an important milestone during the quarter when our NASD business generated the first revenues from our Train B investment in Frederick, Colorado. Now looking forward for the company, as we navigate this challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain confident in the Agilent team and our ability to continue driving leverage earnings growth, use our agile Agilent framework. We faced challenges before, and we're taking actions now that will make us stronger and position us well for the future. As we stated last quarter, we are doubling down on delivering cost efficiencies and increasing productivity. The goal is to generate additional cost savings so we can continue to invest in innovative new solutions and support for our customers as we enable future profitable growth. We are on track to achieve the cost savings we've targeted for the second half of this year. We are in attractive markets that will produce long-term growth. Our innovation engine remains strong and the battle test at One Agilent team is driving outstanding execution. Bob and I will provide the details on our results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back to provide some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you. Thanks, Bob. While today's macroenvironment is challenged for new instrument purchases, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of our end markets, the diversification of our business and in our proven ability to grow faster than the market. I'd like to share a few examples why my confidence remains intact despite near-term challenges. In Pharma, our largest end market, innovation and advance of medicines continue with new therapeutics flowing into the market. The demographic drivers of this market are on our side, a growing global population that expects access to health care and extending life expectancy to be key priorities from their governments. Our market-leading solutions are critical to innovation behind new therapeutics and ensuring the safety and quality of on-market drugs. In the applied markets, growing PFAS testing and the electrical vehicle transition are here to stay, action in new opportunities for growth. Everyone wants to have a safer water to drink, food to eat and air to breathe and the search for and production of more sustainable materials and energy sources remains a global priority. Agilent is a diversified leader in a unique position to help our customers drive their solutions. We remain a trusted partner, our customers though they can rely on in both good and challenging times. Our combination of leading instrumentation and world-class customer support is a long-term competitive advantage. At the heart of this long-term competitive advantage is the Agilent team and the One Agilent culture. You see this reflected in a recent recognition on Glassdoor and in being named A Great Place to Work in all 27 countries and territories around the world where we qualify for certification. We have a company mission focused on advancing the quality of life. To learn more about this, I would encourage you to review the latest addition of the ESG report that we issued last month. We have proactively managed the company through the short term, always with an eye towards our customers and in the long term. We have been proactive in managing our business to drive leveraged earnings but not at the expense of customer satisfaction and future growth. Yes, these are challenging times, but we have the team, the strategy and the right culture that would deliver long-term success. Thank you for joining us today. And now over to you, Parmeet, to lead the question-and-answer session. Parmeet? Yes, Matt, thanks for the question. So let me start with the last part of your question. This is a macro story, not a competitive story. So market shares continue to be very, very strong. I know there's a lot of discussion about increased local competition, but we've moved pretty aggressively on our made in China strategy. So we don't see that all as a competitive issue. Transitory, the comment there is really about the fact that the China market is not going away. It's going to be a big market for years to come. It clearly is challenged right now. And we're not -- we're taking a sort of one quarter at a time, actually month by month. And as Bob mentioned in his comments, I think July, we actually saw the weakest performance within the quarter, and we're still seeing weakness in the pharmaceutical industry, for example, the level of manufacturing declined pretty specifically in the month of July. So we think the market is going to be there, but it's going to take a while for it to get back to growth. And I guess probably the other thing to point here is - and again, I'm talking specifically around the instrument side of the China market. As you know, we have a very large, in fact, the largest installed base of instrumentation in the marketplace. So very positive on the ability to grow the aftermarket in our diagnostics business. Probably anything you add to that? Okay. Yes. We've consistently communicated that we think this is a high single digit, low double-digit kind of growth business for us. It's been that way since pretty much most of my tenure as CEO, and we don't see that changing as we go forward. Of course, there'll be puts and takes by quarter. But we're continuing to see good growth in our connect rates, which we've talked a lot about. And we're also doing very well on winning the enterprise business as well to complement the other aspects of our portfolio offerings. I would say that the profitability was probably a little bit higher in Q3 than - but we do think that the high double-digit number you quote about is pretty manageable for that business, but not at the level we saw in Q3, right, Bob? Good afternoon, Jack. Yes. So as we've talked earlier - thanks for the question and Jack and comments and then have Jacob jump in on this one as well. But we look across the CAM, I'd say the Advanced Materials segment of that market, which we've communicated is more driven by secular trends and cyclical trends continues to hold up quite well. And by the way, also, I just want to point out we had a really tough compare, I think we grew 22% last year in Q3 in CAM. If we look at the chemicals and energy side of it, the energy side actually popped up a bit, particularly driven by the U.S. where we are seeing some weakness is in the chemical side where customers are looking at the macroeconomic environment and are slowing their capital investment there. So I'd say that kind of puts and takes. But I think in terms of the quarter, Bob, I think we came in right about where we thought we'd be in CAM and I'd say it's a mixed story in terms of different segments growing at different rates. 43% in Q3. Do you want to make the comments on the Advanced Materials side of the house there, Jacob? Bob, do you want to lead that one? Yes. By the way, one thing I'd add to that before Bob's, the specifics, Jack, is our decision on the Resolution Bioscience business so as part of the story for us next year in terms of margin expansion. So Bob? Welcome. Yes. We take a change within the quarter. Yes. And overall, outside of China, the geographic performance was better than expected. We saw no trends like the China trend in our other geographies. I think I move away from prudent to transitory. Hi, Dan. I am as old as the dirt and have been working in this marketplace since the mid-90s. I haven't seen a cycle like this before. And we've not seen a situation where the - there's really seem to be a lack of confidence right now in the macro economy. Now, look I'm not sharing - anything that the audience here doesn't fully understand already. So, the way we get out of this, I think is China led by the government. We'll get back to focusing on its long-term goals of making China an innovation driven economy, which will require continued investments in R&D. It's going to also get back to focusing on improving the health of - the population, addressing some of environment issue, so we think it's getting back to fundamentals. Yes, we think that eventually will occur, but there's a lot of issues that we may be work through within the China right now. But - it's a very large market, the market is not going to disappear. And I think there'll be investments. I think there's also needs to be a level of confidence in the private sector in China, that it's a good time to reinvest and maybe I shouldn't wait on the sidelines hope for its stimulus, but get back to work and get my business going. So there's a lot of dynamics. I really have to say though, I don't know if I have a comparable situation that we've been through for this long. I think Bob and I were talking earlier today. The change in the food ministry, a number of years ago is - was the biggest thing we've seen or 24 plus seven some of the biggest things we've seen a change, but this is much more of a macro economic issue in China, which is different than what we've seen before. Obviously, we have an impact on life sciences tool, but it's a much bigger macro story is really driving the softness right now in our markets. Yes, sure Dan. Happy to do so. So obviously, a very difficult decision, then I'll have Sam jump in on this conversation, but our fundamental belief was that our differentiation will be all around what we called the kitted strategy to have a distributed on market companion diagnostics for our pharma partners, and that market really hasn't developed as we had anticipated. Sam? Yes. I think - Sam, when we've talked about this in the past. So, we think we're still going be able to participate in what we believe the strong growth of liquid biopsy market. But to really providing a lot of the - if you will, ingredients for the test developers for themselves. You're welcome. Good afternoon, Brandon. Hi Brandon, I'm going to start with the response to your question. I'll let Bob dig through his notes to find the actual number. But first of all, I just started to say, is that we believe what we're dealing with here in our core instrument portfolio, inclusive of LC and LCMS continues to be a macro market story. Our market shares are holding up really well. We're seeing in our one loss data. We're seeing it in the external reports from order. And I think when we look at our performance in those core platforms versus our peers, we're reporting some numbers and kind of adjust for the timing of when we report. I think we're putting up similar kind of numbers. And Jacob, I know you looked at this thing pretty closely and I'm trying to buy some time for Bob to check down the... Sure. Hi Bob, maybe Bob or Padraig and also going to maybe comment on some discounting trends he may have been seeing? Yes, Bob, I think this is an end market that is holding up reasonably well. I mean we're seeing that on a global basis, in most cases, with the exception being China, where the funding is there, the funding is stable. And it's been a positive surprise for us so far through this year. And I don't... You're welcome. Sure, Rachel. So while we saw signs of stabilization in our European and U.S. business stabilization relative to expectations. We're not hearing anything along those lines yet in terms of recovery or desire to increase spending, the fact we're hearing the exact opposite right now from our large major pharma companies. So, I hope that commentary from others in this space is correct. And there's going to be a big recovery here from year-end, but we're not seeing any kind of indications of that. If it does happen, great. It would be upside relative to our current outlook, and we know we do well in these markets. But Padraig, I don't think we're seeing and hearing anything like along those lines. Right. Thanks for that and Bob. And Rachel, I think the second question relative to - I think you're referring to the small molecule replacement cycle. And as you know, coming probably at least for the last 12 to 18 months, we had been indicating that we were expecting to see a slowdown in the rate of replacement. And in fact, we've seen that occur this year. Actually, given the weakness in China even beyond our expectations with a minus 16% number overall in the quarter. That being said, we do stay with our view that these tend to be 18 to 24 months, 12 to 18-month cycles, and we'd expect that they'll start to see movement back towards a higher growth rate. And that's one of the reasons as we look into '24, we're saying some of these markets will start to turn as - the base cycle gets back to more of a growth phase in that cycle. And as we've mentioned earlier, we see that particularly in liquid chromatography is probably about a five percentage kind of growth market long-term. Okay. So you got it. So relative to China, I would say it's probably the same ratio as the global business, right? That's probably what 60%, 65%? Is probably related to a small molecule. And relative to what's happened in large pharma, what we're seeing is in medium-sized pharma is, again, a continuation of this cautious about deferring capital. I'm sure they're thinking through implications of iRNA also other expenses are running hotter in their P&Ls where they need to make some offsets with capital purchases. That being said, if you believe, and I know pharma believes the importance of having safe on-market drugs. You have to have the instrumentation QA/QC environment to support that. That requires you to have modern liquid chromatography fleets. So, I don't think it's a question that they can - that this market is going to go away and won't be an area that the pharma will need to invest in. You can defer for a period of time, but then only last for so long. Yes. We still have a few more months so we finish off the fiscal year, and we'll give you our guide in November. And I think we'll know a lot more by then. But I do think we know that we'll be able to grow this company in '24. That said, I was very careful in my comments to make sure that there's a full year growth rate. We do expect the first half of the year to be a challenging year just from a comp standpoint to begin with, but also some of the things that we've been talking about today in the call, we don't expect a quick snapback to be occurring in the next quarter or 2. Yes, sure, Patrick, happy to do so, and then I'll invite Padraig to this conversation. I know he's been talking a lot to his team about this. But as I mentioned earlier, we're not really seeing any kind of indication of customers saying, hey, listen, I'm going to have money. I'm planning to spend it this way. In fact, we've seen the opposite where sometimes orders that we thought were closed to actually keep deferring and require more purchases. In fact, I think one story we heard was we probably 3x. Fondo CFO, approved it on the third go-around and the CEO overruled it. So we know eventually going to get that business. But this is kind of dynamics ever seen. So we're not seeing a lot of indications of a strong year-end budget flush. Again, we'd love to see the opposite happen, but we're not going to indication of that. And I don't if you have something to add there. I think this comment, Patrick, on the funnel being strong and these funnels are actually growing is really important because this is one of the reasons why we think about full year outlook in '24. We know the business is there. It's just a question of when it's going to get - Good afternoon, Derik. Yes. I think Bob alluded to it a bit in his prepared remarks, but we still are staying with our balanced capital allocation strategy, and you saw us in the market opportunistically on share repurchases given where we saw the share price setting that. In terms of our - an appetite for M&A, it remains unchanged given - despite the Resolution Bioscience decision. We knew that was a higher risk acquisition for us, early-stage company in hot area based on a really differentiating strategy that didn't want this to play out. But we've had some success in other aspects of our genomics acquisitions, including the AAT acquisition on the instrumentation side. So we're still out there looking. But as Bob mentioned, we take a disciplined approach to not only to how we view our internal choices and our internal business performance in terms of what's in the portfolio, but we'll also take that same lens, if you will, on how we look at M&A. So really, nothing has changed beyond the fact that this is more of a buyer's market. And companies with a strong balance sheet like Agilent, I think they're in a good favorable position to work on opportunities, but we're going to stay disciplined and not get caught up in what once was a value of a company, either in the private or public space. But as I recall, I think 85% of the change was really China driven and bleeds over into pharma in CAM. Yes. So let me start with the view by end market. I think the academia and government market was - grew for us in the third quarter. But everything else was pretty much down. The big change really were in the pharma space. And as Bob commented earlier about how we exited the quarter, the July performance. Some weakness in chemicals, but I'd say the down there was really just a byproduct of - we're going off of 43% compared last year. And we're looking at a 70% growth compare in the fourth quarter. But I'd say the concerns or the cost of this in the China marketplace is really across the board. And with varying degrees, but I think it's really most reflected in the pharma outlook. I think that's a $64,000 question. I think there's a case to be made that this market will get back to its longer-term growth rates, but it will take a period of years to get there. It's not going to be a snapback in 12 months. But again, that's work to be done. The factors that we're looking at, I think are the same factors that everybody else is staring at, which is what's going to happen to the macro in China. Storyboard here is a macro story and is bleeding over into life science tools, but we need to see the China economy get moving again. We need to see consumer confidence coming back. We need to see investment commerce is coming back in China. I think those things will take some time. But I do think there are priorities of the government, and they'll find a way to make that happen. But we're not calling for a quick snapback here either. Based on what we see today, yes. Hi Luke. Let me leave it there. And then have Bob jump-in and Sam as well, but from in-sourcing standpoint. No, we're not seeing any material moves in this direction. And in fact as we head into '24, we continue to broaden our book of business and we're going to have more customers overhead in terms of breadth of customers as we go into '24. And yes, it's called Project Endeavor. So Train B we went live, which we had a different code-named. And that's live, but we continue to move forward with our expansion plans on the other front, siRNA front, along with what we like to do on the CRISPR side as well And antisense. So, we're going to broaden that. So our stated investment plans remain unchanged. Yes, we did mention that there was a benefit, Luke, of the variable pay comp, obviously, that's got a big component of people in it, but it's also a reflection of the scale and - continued growth of that business. We didn't say take that 32% I believe it was in Q3 and kind of book that as the new starting point. Because it had outsized growth. But we continue to be pleased and expect continued margin expansion for ACG going-forward."

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja, to begin. Please go ahead.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, Sarah, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. With me are Mike McMullen, Agilent's President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Mike and Bob's comments will be Jacob Thaysen, President of the Agilent Life Science and Applied Markets Group; Sam Raha, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Padraig McDonnell, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our second quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with the recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments by Mike and Bob will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Our guidance is based on forecasted currency exchange rates. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. In our call today, I'd like to first cover our second quarter results. I'll then provide some insight into the recent market dynamics that we are seeing and how this has translated into lower expectations for the second half of this year. I'll then turn things over to Bob for more detail on the quarter and outlook before returning for some brief closing comments. In an increasingly challenging market environment, the Agilent team delivered very solid results in the second quarter. Revenues of $1.72 billion are up 9.5% core above our expectations with growth across all end markets and regions. Our results are driven by an innovative and broad portfolio, a differentiated customer experience and outstanding execution by the Agilent team. Operating margin for the quarter 25.6%, up 30 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.27 are up 12%. Highlights from an end market perspective include our two largest markets, pharma and chemicals and advanced materials performing very well in the quarter. Our pharma business grew 6% on top of 13% growth last year. Pharma was led by biopharma, which grew 16% driven by lab services, consumables and our NASD business, while small molecule declined 1%. In previous calls, we talked about the small molecule replacement cycle and that the exceptional double-digit growth rates we've seen in the past two years would eventually moderate, which is what we started to see this quarter. Our chemicals and advanced materials business delivered strong results once again growing 16%. The advanced materials segment grew more than 20% and the chemical and energy segment grew double digits. On a geographic basis, 32% growth in China exceeded our high expectations. While the compare was an easier one, even adjusting for the COVID lockdowns in Shanghai a year ago, we still achieved double-digit growth in China. In addition, Europe delivered 5% core growth, while Americas grew 3%, albeit against a tough compare of 13% a year ago. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets group delivered revenues of $968 million, up 10% core. Our strong results were aided by backlog conversion across our instrument platforms. Our LC and LCMS products continued to lead the way with 16% growth in the quarter with strength across all end markets. Continued demand for lab consumables led to 13% growth in that business as well. During the quarter, we added additional strength to our LCMS product line by acquiring e-MSion and their innovative electron capture technology. e-MSion technology allows researchers to develop biotherapeutic products more quickly for treating disease. Agilent's LSAG team continued to bring several innovative new products to market, including enhancements to our Bravo NGS automation, Cary UV-Vis and the cell analysis NovoCyte systems. Many of these enhancements are specifically focused on serving our customers in the biopharma market. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $387 million. This is up 13% core driven by strong revenues from service contracts. ACG's growth was broad-based, representing ongoing resilient demand for our services. We continue to see many opportunities for future growth given our services portfolio. In particular, the benefits of our service offerings as they help customers drive productivity in lab are even more relevant in today's challenging environment. Our strong and trusted customer support is also helping us to drive share gains and acquire new enterprise customers. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $362 million, up 3% core. Strength in our pathology and NASD businesses drove growth, partially offset by general industry-wide weakness in genomics. NASD posted another strong quarter growing in the high 20s. Our Train B manufacturing expansion remains on track to come online later this quarter, while construction has already started on the next phase of expansion. Overall, we wrapped up Agilent's first half of fiscal 2023 with double-digit core growth in both revenue and earnings per share. However, continued macroeconomic uncertainty, coupled with stresses in the banking system have accelerated a more conservative approach from our customers across the globe. This has primarily affected CapEx-related instrument spending across most end markets but are centered mainly in the pharma markets in the U.S. and China. Early stage biotech customers, while a small part of our revenues, dramatically scaled back purchases as funding and liquidity challenges drove cash conservation. Outside of these early-stage biotechs, the order funnel continues to be healthy, but it has taken a longer time for order to be approved, slowing deal velocity and generation of new orders. We expect this constrained capital environment to remain in place throughout the course of our fiscal year. Because of these factors, we are taking a more cautious approach to the second half and have revised our forecast downward. As a result, we now expect core revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4.5%, with EPS growing faster than revenue at 7% to 8%. Our operating margin increased in the first half of the year and we're doubling down on delivering cost efficiencies and increasing productivity to drive more leveraged earnings growth in the second half. As we've done in the past, we will generate additional cost savings so we can continue to invest in innovative new solutions and support for our customers as we enable future profitable growth. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that is battle-tested. They consistently execute at extremely high level and are well prepared to deal with any challenges they may face. Bob will provide the details on our outlook for Q3 and the full year, but overall, we remain convinced our strategic focus, customer service and unmatched execution of the Agilent team remain the keys to our continued success. After Bob delivers his comments, I'll be back to provide some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you.\nRobert McMahon: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated guidance for the year and our third quarter outlook. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Q2 revenue was $1.72 billion, exceeding our expectations. Revenues were up 9.5% core and up 6.8% on a reported basis. Currency was a 2.8 point headwind, while the M&A contribution was minor as expected. In Q2, we continued to leverage our backlog and exited the quarter with our backlog at a normalized level. As Mike mentioned, our two largest end markets performed well in the quarter. Pharma, our largest end market, posted 6% growth led by biopharma, while small molecule declined slightly. Chemicals and advanced materials continued to drive strong secular growth of 16% during the quarter on top of 9% growth last year. The chemical and energy subsegments of the market are doing well, with the advanced materials market continuing to lead the way. As in past quarters, semiconductors and batteries are driving demand in this space. And looking at the rest of the end markets, the food market grew an impressive 21% during the quarter driven by very strong growth in China. We also saw strong results in the Americas and in Europe. The academia and government market was up 11%, led by China and Europe as the funding environment continues to be constructive. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 6% on top of 5% growth last year. Pathology again led the way for us here, partially offset by genomics. And the environmental and forensics business grew 2%, led by China and the Americas, while Europe declined. The Americas slowed after a very strong Q1, but still delivered mid-single-digit growth. On a geographic basis, the China team exceeded our expectations, delivering 32% growth following last year's COVID lockdowns in Shanghai. As we mentioned last year, the COVID-related lockdowns deferred roughly $55 million in Q2 from last year into third and fourth quarters. So while Q2 is an easier compare, we will have much tougher compares in China going forward. Taking out the effects of the lockdown this quarter, we estimate China still grew double digits, so very solid results by our China team. And the rest of Asia grew high single digits, better than expected. The Americas grew 3% with growth across all end markets. From a group perspective, both ACG and DGG grew, while LSAG unexpectedly declined low single digits as we started to see the accelerated effects of the slowing CapEx environment. Europe grew 5%, in line with expectations led by pharma and CAM. Now moving down the P&L. Second quarter gross margin was 55.3%, down 40 basis points from a year ago, largely due to an unfavorable product mix. The benefit of pricing was as expected. Below gross margin, we had good cost discipline in SG&A, which drove our operating margin to 25.6%, up 30 basis points from last year. Below the line, we benefited from higher-than-planned interest income due to higher interest rates and strong cash flow. Our tax rate was 13.75% for the quarter and we had 297 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. Now putting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.27, up 12% from a year ago, a very good result, combined with our 9.5% core topline growth. During the quarter, operating cash flow was very strong, generating $398 million. This result was helped in part by deferring estimated U.S. tax payments of roughly $60 million to our fiscal fourth quarter. This is due to the payment deferral relief made available by the IRS to taxpayers in designated counties affected by the winter storms in California. We returned $151 million to shareholders, $66 million through dividends and repurchased shares worth $85 million, while also investing $57 million in CapEx, continuing our successful balanced approach to capital deployment. Our strong balance sheet is even more of an asset in this market environment and remains very healthy as we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.7x. And earlier this month, Moody's upgraded Agilent's investment-grade rating on our corporate long-term debt to Baa1. This action is an important recognition of Agilent's financial strength. Now on to the revised outlook for the year and guidance for Q3. For the year, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $6.93 billion to $7.03 billion. This represents reported growth of 1.2% to 2.7% and core growth of 3% to 4.5%. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 1.9 points while M&A will contribute 0.1 points of growth. In addition to revising our guidance, we've increased the guidance range for the second half of the year to reflect a wider range of possible outcomes. For modeling purposes, I would encourage you to use the midpoint of our guide. Our updated guidance reflects a more constrained capital market, primarily impacting our instrument business. The outlook for our recurring revenue businesses remains largely unchanged. From an end market perspective, the market most impacted is pharma where we are now expecting full year growth of low single digits, down from high single digits. And from a geographic perspective, we see impacts focused in the U.S. and China. With the change in revenue, we now expect full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.60 and $5.65, representing growth of 7% to 8%. As with revenue, I encourage you to model at the midpoint of our guidance. Now turning to Q3. We expect revenue in the range of $1.64 billion to $1.675 billion. This represents a decline of 4.5% to a decline of 2.5% for both reported and core revenue. This is on top of a tough compare of 13% growth last year. Adjusting for the China deferral in Q3 of last year would add roughly 200 basis points to both reported and core growth in the quarter. Currency and M&A impact in Q3 are minimal, and are expected to offset each other. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.36 and $1.38, representing growth of 1.5% to 3% versus the prior year. We are pleased with the first half performance, and while we are facing a more difficult market environment than we were estimating a quarter ago, I am confident that our team will continue to deliver for our customers. Thanks for being on the call. And now I'll turn over things back to Mike for some closing comments before we take your questions. Mike?\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Bob. During Q4 '22 call in November, I shared with you that I believe Agilent has the right growth strategies, the right team and right culture to continue delivering strong above-market results. My belief remains unchanged. Our customers know we are reliable, resilient and extremely quick in reacting to meet their needs. The Agilent team continues to work hard to earn their trust. While the near-term outlook points to continuing challenges in the market, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects in our end markets and our ability to continue to grow faster than the market. As a trusted partner that our customers know they can rely on, despite the current market environment, I remain confident in our ability to deliver on our shareholder value creation model. Our core values and approach haven't changed. Our focus on investing for growth, providing the industry's best customer support, our innovation prowess and being a great place for our team to work with a differentiated company culture are here to stay. They remain Agilent's formula for long-term success. Thank you. And now to you, Parmeet, to lead the question-and-answer session. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Mike. Sarah, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Couillard: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon.\nMike McMullen: Good afternoon, Brandon.\nBrandon Couillard: Mike, it would be helpful if you kind of unpack what you're seeing in terms of instrument demand between, let's say, mid to large pharma relative to smaller biotech. Some of your peers have talked about maybe that large pharma budget just being delayed coming back later in the year. Curious what you're embedding in kind of your outlook and how you're bringing those two customer bases?\nMike McMullen: Sure. Happy to do so, Brandon. So I think there are differences between the two sectors. The small biotech is pretty much shut down. We've seen real efforts on cash conservation as they've been dealing with the financing challenges of less venture capital money out there, banking crises and limited access to the IPO market. But on the medium-sized and large pharma companies, we still see a very -- actually, an increasing level of conservatism coming from new capital investments, particularly as it relates to our business in instruments. You can make a case that perhaps, there'll be a year-end budget flush, if customers go to try to spend their year-end money that they're not spending now. We're not assuming that because all we can really comment on right now is what we're seeing today. We're not giving any indications that that situation will change. And I think what remains to be seen is, I think it's going to be a CEO/CFO decision at our larger pharma companies about how they'll handle their full year budgets. And again, that relates primarily to the instrument side of our business. As we commented in our prepared remarks, consumables and services continued -- demand continued quite strong in these marketplaces. Anything else to add to that?\nRobert McMahon: Brandon, this is Bob. Just to kind of frame in, if we think about these businesses, this emerging biotech, which is the one that has really changed during the course of Q2. That represents roughly about 10% of our pharma business, and we were projecting that at roughly low double digits. And now we're expecting that to decline. And as Mike was saying, the rest of the business was high single digits, and now we're assuming kind of low double digits, given this more conservative capital. I would also say the funnels are healthy from the standpoint of working with them. It's just taking longer for them to translate that deal velocity into orders.\nMike McMullen: Bob, one thing I forgot to mention as well is we aren't hearing the budgets are being cut. But the timeline, as Bob mentioned, are extended, and we're often here -- often at higher levels of approval as well within our customer base.\nBrandon Couillard: That's helpful. Lastly, if you could unpack kind of what you're seeing in Europe. Overnight, we got pretty weak manufacturing PMIs. I was just curious if you see any slowdown in terms of the more cyclical, let's say, industrial odds in the geography.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Sure, Brandon. No, you may recall earlier this year, we really were pointing to Europe as a watch area, particularly Western Europe. I have to say, we continue to point to it as a watch area, but we've been pleased with the results to date. We are seeing signs of increased cautiousness on the chemical side of our customer base in Europe, but advanced materials continues to be -- demand there. And we're pleased with how the business is holding up right now.\nBrandon Couillard: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question.\nMike McMullen: Sure.\nVijay Kumar: Mike, can you just frame sort of what April trends were? How it may progress because I'm just trying to make sense of the guidance. You guys did double digits in the first half. And we went from double digits to low single-digit declines. Just frame us this pace of slowdown. Is there any historical analogies when you see these kinds of slowdowns? Do these things last like a couple of quarters or is this like four quarters? And I'm assuming this guide change so far, it's only pharma, correct? Like we're not reflecting any other end market changes?\nMike McMullen: So there's a lot to unpack there. Bob, so you and I maybe can tag team on this. But let's first of all talk about the pace of business. So as you're right, Vijay, it really is a tale of two cities. I mean, look at how we performed for the first half, double-digit core growth, double-digit EPS growth, continued margin expansion. But we saw -- and we have been signaling a level of cautiousness in our customer base, and we talked about the uncertainty that was assumed in our second half guide. We've been talking about that for a few quarters. But what I would tell you is that we actually started and it's really a late quarter phenomena. We started to see a little bit maybe the last week or so of March, really centered in April, where the level of caution from our customers increased. Deal cycles were continuing to get further pushed out, deals weren't closing. And that really was the reason for the push in terms of downward guide for the second half. What I can tell you, what we're seeing so far through May, I think that was also one of your questions, is mid-May today orders, if you will, are tracking towards our revised order expectation. We haven't -- we've been through these cycles before in terms of downturns. These are always hard to predict because it's always hard to know exactly when the cycle started. But our experience is at least 12-month kind of cycles, 12 to 18 months. So -- and I think that's really the question that we need to work through here in the next few quarters. And again, as Bob and I have said in the past, we take one quarter at a time. And what we're trying to do here is comment to you today is what we're seeing today in the marketplace, and it's a level of increased cautiousness on capital deployment.\nRobert McMahon: Vijay, maybe just to add a couple of other comments to what Mike was saying. In the second quarter, we talked about revenue exceeding our orders, and that was really at the -- towards the back end. And we came into Q2, we'd say, still greater than normal backlog. And so we were able to -- our OFS team was able to actually drive down our backlog and leverage that. And if you took the backlog impact out of our numbers, we would have been at mid-single digits for transparency in Q2. And we had built some of that into our forecast. We just didn't refill the funnel as much as we thought we were going to coming into Q2, which means resulted in a lower expectation for the second half of the year.\nVijay Kumar: That's extremely helpful, Bob and Mike. Sorry, go ahead, Mike.\nMike McMullen: I was just going to say too, Bob, I think it's fair to say relative to our guide assumptions, we're mainly looking at the pharma market. Although this level of cautiousness -- the increased level of cautiousness we're seeing is really across all end market segments, but really centered in pharma.\nRobert McMahon: Yes.\nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Mike. And just one quick one. This back half EPS and margins up, I think 2Q operating margins missed and just rough math here suggests back half operating margins need to be up 300 basis points from 2Q levels. With revenues coming down, can you just walk us through what gets us to that? What drives that margin expansion?\nRobert McMahon: Yes, you're right. In Q2, we did -- we had higher revenues than expected. And we did have some negative mix effect that resulted in a lower-than-expected margin. Now we did expand. We just didn't expand as much as we had anticipated. And as a result of the lower guidance, as Mike talked about doubling down on cost efficiencies, so we've taken a number of actions to streamline our spending profile in the second half of the year in order to drive greater margin expansion in the second half to drive the EPS.\nMike McMullen: And Vijay, I'd also point out there is a level of variability in our pay plans tied directly to adjust for the company's performance that are assumed in our guide for second half.\nVijay Kumar: Thanks guys.\nRobert McMahon: All right.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yes, hi Mike, Bob, thanks for taking the question. Thanks Mike. So first one is really on, obviously, China, very strong in the quarter. Can you elaborate a bit on sort of the stimulus contribution that happened this quarter? And what are you -- obviously, you're expecting moderation in the second half. Also, if you could talk about if you're seeing anything relevant to the new COVID wave that's emerging there. Is that something baked into your guide and overall just expectations for China for the full year?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Why don't I start out with answering the last question first, and then I'll probably mention to you, Bob, to our guide assumptions. But in terms of -- I think you mentioned the new COVID wave, we've not considered that into our second half guide, and I don't believe we would because we have experienced pretty significant COVID waves throughout the years. And as we've shown each quarter, we can very easily -- not easily, but we can navigate through that. In fact, that was a storyboard that you may recall from Q1 of this year. Relative to stimulus, we've been on record and the story remains the same as we've seen no material impact from China stimulus, which, in fact, we understand was closed off at the end of -- in February. And that initial stimulus program from our understanding was really focused on more on the high-end research space, things such as NMRs and SEMs, products where we don't have an offering or compete. So we're not seeing much happening at all on our front relative to stimulus. Now there is some discussion in the marketplace that maybe there's another one coming. If that would occur, that would be upside to our forecast for the year as we're assuming really no change in the current environment and no stimulus is assumed in our second half guide. And Bob, I know we've made some adjustments to the outlook for China for the year?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. Puneet, if we look at Q2, we always assumed that Q2 was going to be a very strong, given what we were facing on an easier comp, and we talked about that in our prepared remarks, where Shanghai was shut down for roughly six weeks. That deferred roughly $50 million to $55 million of revenue that's now showing up in Q3 and Q4 of last year, which will make it much tougher comps. And to give you a perspective, last year, we went minus 3% in Q2, 29% growth and then 44% growth. So we're always expecting moderated growth expectations in the back half of the year just given that tough comp. Now what we've seen is not a pickup in the performance in the marketplace, particularly in pharma, which we were expecting coming out of kind of the first quarter after the elimination of the zero COVID. And we're assuming that this current performance will maintain through the second half of the year. We're not going to see a recovery.\nPuneet Souda: Got it. That's super helpful. And then if I could touch on the early-stage biotech customers. Can you just remind us for the overall company, I know you provided pharma. But for the overall company, what's the mix there? And then also, is there any impact that you saw -- expect there in the NASD business or your cell therapy offerings as a result of that? And just given the number of questions we're getting here, just at a high level, Mike, instrumentation, very strong over the last two years, one of the remarkable cycle of instrumentation placements that we have seen over the last few decades. When do you think we get back to sort of a normalized order pattern for instrumentation?\nMike McMullen: So maybe we start with the biotech and NASD business questions first. So no impact at all in our NASD business. I think, Sam, we can say that pretty equivocally, right?\nRobert McMahon: And to give you a perspective, emerging biotech, Puneet, is roughly -- it's less than 5% of the total company. It's roughly closer to 3% for the full company in terms of revenue.\nMike McMullen: And your last question is the toughest question, which is, sort of, if you will, your crystal ball question. We've typically seen 12- to 18-month kind of cycles historically. And as Jacob and I and Bob have talked in the past, we've always felt that this is more of a mid-single-digit kind of growth market with -- for instruments, which is still very healthy end market growth rate and particularly when you build around at the service and consumables piece. We're not calling for that yet to occur for this year. So I think the only other thing I would say is for a large majority of our instrument business it is a replacement cycle. We've talked about that time and time again. And so these products are in the installed base. They will have to be replaced. The question is when. And again, interest and demand remains high. I mean, our backlog is strong. As we mentioned in prior calls, and I just -- we emphasized that again today. Quality backlog remains high, no significant order cancellations and as Padraig likes to say, we're adding fresh funnel to the backlog. So it points to future demand, but we're just not seeing indications of when their buying behaviors are going to change.\nPuneet Souda: All right, thanks. Thanks guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sykes: Hi. Good afternoon, Mike and Bob. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is just clearly the -- it seems to be the delta in the changing full year guide is largely concentrated in pharma, both large and small. But given the sort of resilience you've seen in the strength in the chemical and advanced materials space with that 16% growth, what is your kind of outlook on that end market? I mean should we expect a level of durability of demand certainly relative to what you're seeing in pharma over the course of this year, which could help offset some of the growth impact you're seeing in outside?\nMike McMullen: It's a great question. And Bob, I think that's actually what we've assumed in our full year guide. So maybe you want to share some of the specifics?\nRobert McMahon: Yes, Matt. What we've built into the -- if you looked at where we were at the beginning of the year, the largest changes in pharma, where we were at high single digits, and as I mentioned, going to low single digits. Our chemical and advanced materials, we're still assuming a mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year. Certainly front-end loaded given kind of the challenges that we see in terms of the comps with China. But we are seeing -- we are expecting that to be more resilient given some of the fundamental secular drivers of semicon and batteries. So it continues to be strong and are expected to stay strong in the second half of the year as well.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. It's really helpful. And then just a second question for you guys, maybe Padraig. Just on ACG, just given if we do have this sort of 12- to 18-month cycle, you've talked in the past about the ability for ACG on the services side, whether it's extended warranties or others in terms of kind of helping to offset some of the weakness you might see in sort of capital equipment purchases by extending those services or increasing the services revenues. I realize it's a smaller portion of revenue relative to LSAG. But I'm just wondering if this is sort of a 12- to 18-month cycle, could you see some level of acceleration or at least durable sort of low double, high single-digit growth in ACG over the course of that time period?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I think the breadth of product offerings across many of the hardware platforms enables us to add all types of customer -- all types of customer operations. And what we're seeing is extremely strong demand for our services as utilization of the installed base happens. And in particular, we're seeing lab-wide enterprise service offerings, a big demand for that where we're helping customers with their efficiency, their asset management and so on. So I think it's a very durable business, and I think it's going to continue to be durable over that time frame.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think durability is the right word to use here, Padraig and Matt. And this is a resilient part of our company's portfolio. We've talked about these recurring revenue businesses. And I think the story here is even bigger, Padraig, than extension of instrument life as people are deferring replacement purchases. We also believe we've been picking up share and particularly been doing really nicely job on the enterprise level.\nPadraig McDonnell: I would also say, Mike, we still have a big opportunity to attach our service contracts onto the business. And of course, as we go through this cycle, we continue to accelerate that.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Okay, thank you for taking the questions. So first, just maybe some questions on backlog. You noted that you worked on your backlog this quarter. So could you just tell us how many months of backlog do you have on that instrument portfolio today? And then last quarter, you noted that you'd worked on the backlog on the instrument portfolio, but for the total business, orders can grew faster than revenues. So can you kind of give us some of that context as well in terms of order book and backlog trends between instruments versus the rest of the business as well?\nMike McMullen: Rachel, thanks for the question. As you know, we don't report on book-to-bill, but what we can use is how to qualitatively describe the backlog and I think we used the word normalized backlog from the elevated levels we have seen in the quarter. So we're at a normal level of backlog in terms of month supply. So -- and we've been talking about this movement towards normalization in terms of the backlog, and we're there now. Yes.\nRobert McMahon: And Rachel, you're right. Our orders grew greater than revenue in Q1. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, Q2, it reversed where revenue was greater than orders. And we did eat into backlog both in Q1 and Q2 in the instrument side and supply. As to the delivery times declined, we thought that that was a healthy thing. And we're back at normalized delivery times as well as a normalized backlog.\nMike McMullen: Bob, I think we did have some pretty tough compares in terms of our prior year order growth. But -- and I think ACG and DGG continued to grow in the quarter.\nRobert McMahon: That's right. Yes.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then a question on the LC market here. You guys grew 16% in the quarter. So we've heard some varying comments on this market. So can you just walk us through what are you exactly seeing? And what do you expect for the full year for LC growth? And then finally, you've said some comments today about share gains. You talked about that in some recent weeks as well or recent months as well. So can you just talk to us about share gains and kind of what parts of the market, whether that's geographic basis or customer segment wise, that you're doing in LC?\nMike McMullen: Yes, I'm going to pull Jacob into this call, but he has had an opportunity to join in the conversation. But I think the storyboard here for LC is very consistent with the overall macro environment we described, which is an increasingly cautious set of decisions being made by customers relative to new instrument purchases. And as you know, we've been talking for some quarters about the moderation we were expecting to see in small molecule LC placements, that the 20-plus growth rates that the industry have been seeing for a number of quarters, would actually see a level of moderation start to occur. And that's what we saw in this recent quarter, and we would expect to see that continue throughout this year. And perhaps, you want to add some of your thoughts here as well, Jacob, and then take on the question about market share as well.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, absolutely, and thanks for the question. I mean, first of all, we continue to see good market share gain in the LC business. And we see that, as Mike was mentioning also, over the last year, we have really seen a high growth in the LC business over many of our end markets. Obviously, being fueled significantly in the pharma, both small and large molecules. And as both Mike and Bob was talking about, these markets are changing right now. So while we will see a change in the market dynamics and thereby also some of the growth rates, the strategy have been in place from LCMS and pretty much the whole portfolio has been to build these workflows that is based on robust reliable instruments and really solution-oriented. And we expect and we see that this is what our customers are looking for. And hence, I'm expecting that while the markets are down, we will continue to see market share gain in this business and also in the LCMS business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nDan Leonard: Hi, thank you. Going back to the, Mike, so your comment on large pharma, mid and large pharma, the 90% of the business is not the emerging biotech within your reported pharma segment. Do you have any sense or any theory from your field team on why that customer base has gotten more cautious and why deal cycles have lengthened? I wouldn't think it would be very GDP, PMI-tethered and I wouldn't think that Silicon Valley Bank or what have you would be that material for that customer set.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I don't think you can point to Silicon Valley, but you can point to the pressure that the pharma companies run relative to their P&Ls, and they're cautious. They're really cautious about deploying new capital. And it's...\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. And I would add, Mike, the approval levels that we're seeing are going up and up and at the highest levels within pharma accounts are making decisions on capital purchase. So a lot of caution is around that.\nMike McMullen: Yes. And Dan, I have to say in all transparency, it's a little bit hard to figure out, right, because we had a similar thesis, which was the markets would be more resilient. Although we expect with some level of pressure as we assumed in our second half guide, a little more resilient in the face of slowing GDP. But things have -- obviously, things have moved more quickly than we had anticipated. And this level of increased costs was something we've seen in the last probably four to six weeks. And it's difficult to figure out from the standpoint is there's no obvious external catalyst. We just know we're seeing it across a broad section of our customer base.\nDan Leonard: Appreciate that. And a separate question. Can you comment a bit more on what's going on in the genomics market within your DGG business? Do you think there's any share shift happen? Is it all the pressure is market related? And when would you expect that that could improve?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So I'm going to invite Sam on to this, but I think what you'll hear from him is he'll talk to you about it's a U.S.-centric phenomenon, not a market share issue. And there is that level of CapEx there that's on the instrument side that we're feeling a bit as well.\nSam Raha: Yes. Absolutely, Mike. And thank you for the question. What we found is that when you think about translational research, we've already talked about pharma here also as it's used in genomics and diagnostic testing too. There's just become a slowness in decision making, not only in instruments, but even in the usage of consumables particularly on the instruments. I will tell you that even within the quarter, our NGS QC backlog for consumables related to NGS QC, that's actually grown and our orders have grown. So we're doing well there. But there has been a slowness that we're seeing that's broad-based. And to answer your question about share, we don't believe that we're losing share. Similar to what you've heard about the instrument, it's not that we're losing orders at the time in which the orders are being placed. It is just being lengthened. And in U.S. in particular, a little bit in China is where we're seeing the impact.\nMike McMullen: We are assuming a level of improvement in our genomics business in the second half in our guidance I'll recall, Bob, and not full recovery, but improvement.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. I would say, Dan, some of our end customers have had a really challenging time and shut down sites, and that has affected our volumes. We saw that in Q1, and it continued into Q2. As Mike, you're saying, we start anniversary-ing some of those in the back half of the year and expect it to perform better. But some of those are customer-specific.\nDan Leonard: Thank you for all the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMike Ryskin: Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Mike Ryskin on for Derik. Just following up on the previous point on pharma -- big pharma slowing down. You used a lot of comments in a slower deal velocity taking longer to close the deals, et cetera. But as you just said, you're not seeing an obvious catalyst. Is there any risk you're going to see slower deal velocity elsewhere as you go through the year? I mean, academic and government, applied materials, these are sectors that also had, I would say, above trend growth in recent years and in the fiscal first half. So -- but you're not building in any conservatism in those areas for the rest of the year. So how would you characterize the risk there just given how quickly pharma turned?\nMike McMullen: Sure. Bob and I think we've got a realistic forecast here. And that's why we're asking to think about guidance in the midpoint. We had already assumed some level of slower capital investment in those end markets in our previous guide. So there really is no change to that. We think that outside of maybe the chemical side of CAM, those other end markets will hold up relative to our guide expectations. And listen, we've had experience in these cycles before. And Mike, one of the things I wanted to mention earlier to a previous caller's question was, we know when the market is low. This is actually when the Agilent team even shines further. We always gain market share in down markets. So I'm absolutely convinced you heard in my prepared remarks that we're going to come out of this thing stronger. I think the only debate is how long the cycle is going to be.\nMike Ryskin: Right, right. Yes. And then kind of to that point, for the fiscal second half, I mean, you're pointing to a 3.5% decline core growth, core sales growth in 3Q, but then it implies roughly flat in 4Q. You touched a little bit on comps at China moving around and things like that. But still sequentially, that's a pretty big reacceleration in the fourth quarter regardless of how you look at it even in absolute dollar terms. So are you assuming any reaccel in the 4Q? Are you -- any indication of that happening in terms of orders? I guess, just why is it really fiscal 3Q that's being hammered here?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. I mean, we typically do have some seasonality built into our results. If you not just looked at last year, but historically, our Q4 does have a typical ramp-up from Q3. And we're looking at it. If you look historically kind of how we're looking at the seasonality, that's kind of how we built it in. We are expecting stronger both revenue and order performance, Q4 relative to Q3, based on what we know today.\nMike Ryskin: Okay, all right, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Great, thanks. Thanks guys for the questions. Mike and Bob, maybe just a question just kind of clarifying some of the numbers here on emerging biopharma. What did that business do in the quarter itself? I don't think I caught that. I know, Bob, you said it's going to decline as part of your guidance. So if you just flush out like what you're assuming for the rest of the year for emerging biopharma and then kind of what does that imply for the commercial biopharma? And I didn't hear any as well for LSAG. Like did you guys talk about what you're expecting LSAG to do in the back half of the year?\nRobert McMahon: Yes, I would say -- let me take the last one first. Our LSAG business, where we were assuming for the full year kind of mid-single-digit growth with it front-end loaded, we're now expecting low single digits, just above 0. So we're actually expecting a decline in both the second -- third quarter and fourth quarter for LSAG driven in part by the emerging biotech and the small molecule. In terms of the biopharma, biopharma actually in total grew 16% in the Q2 results, and that was benefited obviously from NASD. If you took NASD out, it was 11%. So what we saw was this change in the quarter, and we're assuming that change will stay pretty consistent in the back half of the year.\nDan Brennan: Got it. Okay. And then -- and maybe just one on NASD since you brought it up. Another terrific quarter. Can you just unpack a little bit on kind of what the funnel looks like there? Is the same level of growth kind of persist in the second half? And now that you're bringing on -- kind of working on the new Train, kind of what's the durability of that growth as you look out beyond year-end?\nMike McMullen: Of course, you will take that one.\nRobert McMahon: Yes, super pleased with the performance of NASD. And as we look out to the second half of the year, we feel good about the performance and are excited about Train B coming online. And we're having conversations with customers as we look to fill that Train up. And what I would say is kind of stay tuned from that standpoint. But what I would say long term, we're extremely excited about this. That's why we're investing another $700 million in adding Train C and D as well. So we think that we're in the early stage of therapeutic discovery here in terms of RNA, siRNA-based therapies and there will just be more larger indications as those move through the clinic.\nMike McMullen: Absolutely.\nDan Brennan: Great, thanks guys.\nMike McMullen: You're welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. So I have one more question on China. Obviously, great quarter even if you exclude the comps. But you're talking about some incremental caution here. Can you talk about like what customers in the China region you're seeing. Some of this incremental caution, is CDMOs one of those? Just any color on specific customers in the region would be great.\nMike McMullen: Yes, sure. Maybe I'll tag team with you, Padraig, on this one. So as Bob mentioned, even adjusting for the Shanghai shutdown last year, we did 10% core in China in Q2. We are bumping up some pretty hefty comparisons, 29% and 44%, if I remember the numbers correctly, for Q3 and Q4. But I would say that the China market is really reflective of what we're seeing in the United States as well. So it's our pharma customers in China. It's our chemical customers in China, albeit the advanced materials piece of the China market continues to hold up quite nicely. And Padraig, I know you've been in conversations with our China sales leader. What are you hearing from them?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No, I think you said it well, Mike. It's a very similar dynamics in China from what we're seeing in the rest of the world, which is quite simply customers have become more conservative CapEx budgets and spending decisions, albeit on the EV markets and so on, that's a particular strength that we're going to continue to see. But I think that's what we're seeing. Yes.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then one market you didn't call out in CAM was the PFAS testing. I was wondering if you could give us an update on that and just how you're -- if there's been a change in terms of the market dynamics there?\nMike McMullen: I think we remain very positive on that, Jacob, right?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, absolutely. I think that we are still in the -- to use the baseball term, the early innings.\nMike McMullen: Yes, American baseball terms.\nJacob Thaysen: I think I am, but we certainly are early innings here. We have been -- we've seen a lot of growth last year, and we continue to see it. Obviously, right now, since there's also a lot of funding through the government, it's a little bit lumpy. But if you look at for the long horizon, this is a huge opportunity for us, and we have a very strong position with our LCMS business here. And we're also seeing it expanding into new areas with the DCMS business. So I'm still very bullish on that, and we continue to see a lot of business here.\nMike McMullen: And Jack, I think it's also fair to say it's primarily a U.S. and a little bit European phenomena. We've got to see really new ranks being deployed and implemented in China and Japan, which down the road could be a source of continued growth on a global basis.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, you're absolutely right, Mike. I mean there's a lot of things going on here in U.S., and there's been regulation in certain states right now, but it's driven by regulation. So when regulations go onboard and online in different countries, you see a step-up in that. So there's definitely more to come here.\nJack Meehan: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Mike, just a quick one. Just following up on the LSAG piece. Getting a good amount of inbounds on that. I know you don't want to talk about the book-to-bill, Mike, but just given the level of focus and the visibility here, I know you mentioned the backlog, back down to normal. It seemed like that was adding to it a little bit this quarter. Can you give us a sense on the orders? I mean, were they down double digits? And Bob, maybe just the magnitude of what that decline could look like in 3Q in terms of LSAG revs would be helpful.\nMike McMullen: Yes, sure. We want to give you some additional insights, Bob, so I think you've got some?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. So if you looked at our overall orders, they were down low single digits. As Mike mentioned, ACG and DDG grew and LSAG was down mid- to high single digits in the quarter. And as I mentioned before, our guide contemplates a decline for LSAG in both Q3 and Q4.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. Got it. And then maybe just a margin piece. I know you talked a little bit about the second half. And Mike, I think you flagged maybe some additional cost savings in the second half. Can you just talk about, I guess, where you guys are pulling some costs from? How nimble you can be, and how aggressive you want to be as well. Mike, you obviously sound good on the long term. You're kind of dealing with this pullback here. Looks like it's transitory. So how do you think about just the expense management in the near term and that second half margin ramp?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'm really glad to address this head on. So because you hit one of the key messages, we still are very positive on the long-term growth opportunities in these markets we serve. We think we're in a pause in certain segments of our market, but we remain very bullish on the long-term end markets. And the trick here is to make sure you're doing the right thing to manage the business in the short run in terms of being able to deliver leveraged earnings growth for our shareholders, and that's why I talked about the confidence we have in our shareholder value creation model. But at the same point in time, make sure that we don't cut off things that are going to get in the way of our long-term growth. And we know how to do this. We've done this before. We've got some variable pay programs. We have things we look at relative to travel and other things that are associated with expense, things that aren't necessarily immediately near-term revenue generating. And then what we'll do is we'll prioritize. We'll make sure that we're focusing on the sustaining our ability to realize the growth opportunities in a lot of these businesses, which are growing right now. One thing that came out today is it's a story of the multiple growth drivers across Agilent. Clearly, we're having some near-term challenges right now in analytical instrumentation business, yet pathology is growing well. NSE is growing well, services, consumables. So we've got a pretty rigorous program. And what I can assure you is that we will make the reductions in areas that we don't think will get in the way of our ability to continue to sustain what we believe to be out market growth. And Bob, I know you put a lot of thought and time on this, but we've already been activating a lot of the software already. So we didn't wait to the earnings call to get started on this, but I know that we think there's a path forward here for us.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. Just to build on what Mike is saying. Obviously, we've got -- we've been looking at discretionary spend, things like travel but also demand related. If there's not demand, we're not going to spend the same level of marketing funds as an example. And we continue to really drive productivity. We talked about that at the very beginning of the year around productivity in our workforce, and we'll continue to do that, making sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves in terms of adding more people relative to the business.\nPatrick Donnelly: Understood. Thank you, guys.\nRobert McMahon: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Waldman: Mike, curious what year-over-year orders were in LC and mass spec? Were orders there down kind of in the mid-teens range? And then within large pharma, I think you mentioned the funnel remains healthy, but it's just taking longer to close deals. I guess based on conversations with key accounts recently, anything you can point to that gives you confidence that the slower orders here are more reflecting delays in the purchasing process as opposed to just tighter budgets and maybe lapse reprioritize the capital to other instrument categories, maybe outside of LCMS?\nMike McMullen: Yes, I want to tag team with Padraig on this, and then I'll go back to the order question to Bob. But yes, I mean, what we're hearing or I heard directly is customers aren't cutting their budgets. And I happened to be in Europe last month at our demo facility in Vauban, Germany. It's fully booked for the next three months. I mean -- so there's a lot of interest, a lot of interest in Agilent solutions. We just can't get the PEOs through their approval process inside their companies. And that's why we think it's transitory, although we have to acknowledge what we're seeing today, and that's reflective of the revised guide for the second half.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No. Look, I think you're right, Mike. I think the customer activity remains high. I think one thing that we've really seen is no uptick in cancellations whatsoever. Funnels remain intact. And actually, we're adding fresh funnel in certain cases. So I think it's really a case of slower deal velocity.\nRobert McMahon: And on orders, Josh, we won't disclose individual product lines. But as I mentioned, the order growth for LSAG was down mid to high, and they were higher than that. The decline was greater than the average.\nJosh Waldman: Okay. And then just a follow-up, I think, on Jack's question. Can you provide more context on what within pharma in China has been softer than expected? Any examples of customers -- any examples that customers have provided on why they're pulling back? And then curious if the softness has been pocketed within a few large accounts there or if it's been fairly systemic?\nMike McMullen: I think there's no real significant difference between some segments of the overall pharma market. And I think the -- and Padraig, correct me if I'm wrong, I think the overall sentiment is economic uncertainty and just being cautious. It's a -- it's like I said earlier, it's a hard one to initially figure out because there's no obvious external catalysts because we deal with this. But -- this is what we're seeing, and we just thought it was important to share that directly on the call today.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. I think, Josh, the one thing that we did see, and we talked about this at the beginning of the year because there was a lot of talk about the stimulus. That stimulus was targeted at higher-end applications and instrumentation that we don't necessarily have the product portfolio or compete in. And so I don't think that has moved budgets, but it created a stimulus for potentially areas that we're not as exposed to as maybe some other players in the marketplace.\nJosh Waldman: Okay. I appreciate all the detail.\nMike McMullen: You're quite welcome.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Liza Garcia with UBS. Please go ahead.\nLiza Garcia: Thanks for squeezing me in. Really appreciate it. I guess coming back to the margin progression in the guidance and just kind of -- I appreciate all the clarity on kind of the cost potential. But also with the second train line kind of ramping and thinking about NAV, I know that you've talked about how those should be accretive -- train line should be accretive to the overall margins. But just as we think about it ramping, can you just give us some context to how to think about that train line coming on and its impact in the back half?\nMike McMullen: Bob, do you want to take that? .\nRobert McMahon: Yes, sure. So Liza, if you looked at that in isolation, actually, there is margin compression, given the Train B startup. But we've taken that into account. We had that in our initial guide, and that's money. That's good money to spend because we've got a lot of opportunity there. And so the cost savings that we've been talking about is really not in that area. It's in the other parts of the business.\nLiza Garcia: Great. And I just don't think I caught this, but I'm assuming pricing is still tracking to -- is 300 bps still kind of what we should be thinking about in the guidance?\nRobert McMahon: That's correct. That's correct. It was actually a little over 4% for Q2.\nLiza Garcia: Great. Thank you so much guys.\nRobert McMahon: You're quite welcome.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Sarah, and thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to end the call for today. Have a great rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated guidance for the year and our third quarter outlook. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. Q2 revenue was $1.72 billion, exceeding our expectations. Revenues were up 9.5% core and up 6.8% on a reported basis. Currency was a 2.8 point headwind, while the M&A contribution was minor as expected. In Q2, we continued to leverage our backlog and exited the quarter with our backlog at a normalized level. As Mike mentioned, our two largest end markets performed well in the quarter. Pharma, our largest end market, posted 6% growth led by biopharma, while small molecule declined slightly. Chemicals and advanced materials continued to drive strong secular growth of 16% during the quarter on top of 9% growth last year. The chemical and energy subsegments of the market are doing well, with the advanced materials market continuing to lead the way. As in past quarters, semiconductors and batteries are driving demand in this space. And looking at the rest of the end markets, the food market grew an impressive 21% during the quarter driven by very strong growth in China. We also saw strong results in the Americas and in Europe. The academia and government market was up 11%, led by China and Europe as the funding environment continues to be constructive. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 6% on top of 5% growth last year. Pathology again led the way for us here, partially offset by genomics. And the environmental and forensics business grew 2%, led by China and the Americas, while Europe declined. The Americas slowed after a very strong Q1, but still delivered mid-single-digit growth. On a geographic basis, the China team exceeded our expectations, delivering 32% growth following last year's COVID lockdowns in Shanghai. As we mentioned last year, the COVID-related lockdowns deferred roughly $55 million in Q2 from last year into third and fourth quarters. So while Q2 is an easier compare, we will have much tougher compares in China going forward. Taking out the effects of the lockdown this quarter, we estimate China still grew double digits, so very solid results by our China team. And the rest of Asia grew high single digits, better than expected. The Americas grew 3% with growth across all end markets. From a group perspective, both ACG and DGG grew, while LSAG unexpectedly declined low single digits as we started to see the accelerated effects of the slowing CapEx environment. Europe grew 5%, in line with expectations led by pharma and CAM. Now moving down the P&L. Second quarter gross margin was 55.3%, down 40 basis points from a year ago, largely due to an unfavorable product mix. The benefit of pricing was as expected. Below gross margin, we had good cost discipline in SG&A, which drove our operating margin to 25.6%, up 30 basis points from last year. Below the line, we benefited from higher-than-planned interest income due to higher interest rates and strong cash flow. Our tax rate was 13.75% for the quarter and we had 297 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. Now putting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.27, up 12% from a year ago, a very good result, combined with our 9.5% core topline growth. During the quarter, operating cash flow was very strong, generating $398 million. This result was helped in part by deferring estimated U.S. tax payments of roughly $60 million to our fiscal fourth quarter. This is due to the payment deferral relief made available by the IRS to taxpayers in designated counties affected by the winter storms in California. We returned $151 million to shareholders, $66 million through dividends and repurchased shares worth $85 million, while also investing $57 million in CapEx, continuing our successful balanced approach to capital deployment. Our strong balance sheet is even more of an asset in this market environment and remains very healthy as we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.7x. And earlier this month, Moody's upgraded Agilent's investment-grade rating on our corporate long-term debt to Baa1. This action is an important recognition of Agilent's financial strength. Now on to the revised outlook for the year and guidance for Q3. For the year, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $6.93 billion to $7.03 billion. This represents reported growth of 1.2% to 2.7% and core growth of 3% to 4.5%. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 1.9 points while M&A will contribute 0.1 points of growth. In addition to revising our guidance, we've increased the guidance range for the second half of the year to reflect a wider range of possible outcomes. For modeling purposes, I would encourage you to use the midpoint of our guide. Our updated guidance reflects a more constrained capital market, primarily impacting our instrument business. The outlook for our recurring revenue businesses remains largely unchanged. From an end market perspective, the market most impacted is pharma where we are now expecting full year growth of low single digits, down from high single digits. And from a geographic perspective, we see impacts focused in the U.S. and China. With the change in revenue, we now expect full year fiscal 2023 non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $5.60 and $5.65, representing growth of 7% to 8%. As with revenue, I encourage you to model at the midpoint of our guidance. Now turning to Q3. We expect revenue in the range of $1.64 billion to $1.675 billion. This represents a decline of 4.5% to a decline of 2.5% for both reported and core revenue. This is on top of a tough compare of 13% growth last year. Adjusting for the China deferral in Q3 of last year would add roughly 200 basis points to both reported and core growth in the quarter. Currency and M&A impact in Q3 are minimal, and are expected to offset each other. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.36 and $1.38, representing growth of 1.5% to 3% versus the prior year. We are pleased with the first half performance, and while we are facing a more difficult market environment than we were estimating a quarter ago, I am confident that our team will continue to deliver for our customers. Thanks for being on the call. And now I'll turn over things back to Mike for some closing comments before we take your questions. Mike? Brandon, this is Bob. Just to kind of frame in, if we think about these businesses, this emerging biotech, which is the one that has really changed during the course of Q2. That represents roughly about 10% of our pharma business, and we were projecting that at roughly low double digits. And now we're expecting that to decline. And as Mike was saying, the rest of the business was high single digits, and now we're assuming kind of low double digits, given this more conservative capital. I would also say the funnels are healthy from the standpoint of working with them. It's just taking longer for them to translate that deal velocity into orders. Vijay, maybe just to add a couple of other comments to what Mike was saying. In the second quarter, we talked about revenue exceeding our orders, and that was really at the -- towards the back end. And we came into Q2, we'd say, still greater than normal backlog. And so we were able to -- our OFS team was able to actually drive down our backlog and leverage that. And if you took the backlog impact out of our numbers, we would have been at mid-single digits for transparency in Q2. And we had built some of that into our forecast. We just didn't refill the funnel as much as we thought we were going to coming into Q2, which means resulted in a lower expectation for the second half of the year. Yes. Yes, you're right. In Q2, we did -- we had higher revenues than expected. And we did have some negative mix effect that resulted in a lower-than-expected margin. Now we did expand. We just didn't expand as much as we had anticipated. And as a result of the lower guidance, as Mike talked about doubling down on cost efficiencies, so we've taken a number of actions to streamline our spending profile in the second half of the year in order to drive greater margin expansion in the second half to drive the EPS. All right. Yes. Puneet, if we look at Q2, we always assumed that Q2 was going to be a very strong, given what we were facing on an easier comp, and we talked about that in our prepared remarks, where Shanghai was shut down for roughly six weeks. That deferred roughly $50 million to $55 million of revenue that's now showing up in Q3 and Q4 of last year, which will make it much tougher comps. And to give you a perspective, last year, we went minus 3% in Q2, 29% growth and then 44% growth. So we're always expecting moderated growth expectations in the back half of the year just given that tough comp. Now what we've seen is not a pickup in the performance in the marketplace, particularly in pharma, which we were expecting coming out of kind of the first quarter after the elimination of the zero COVID. And we're assuming that this current performance will maintain through the second half of the year. We're not going to see a recovery. And to give you a perspective, emerging biotech, Puneet, is roughly -- it's less than 5% of the total company. It's roughly closer to 3% for the full company in terms of revenue. Yes, Matt. What we've built into the -- if you looked at where we were at the beginning of the year, the largest changes in pharma, where we were at high single digits, and as I mentioned, going to low single digits. Our chemical and advanced materials, we're still assuming a mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year. Certainly front-end loaded given kind of the challenges that we see in terms of the comps with China. But we are seeing -- we are expecting that to be more resilient given some of the fundamental secular drivers of semicon and batteries. So it continues to be strong and are expected to stay strong in the second half of the year as well. And Rachel, you're right. Our orders grew greater than revenue in Q1. And as I mentioned earlier in the call, Q2, it reversed where revenue was greater than orders. And we did eat into backlog both in Q1 and Q2 in the instrument side and supply. As to the delivery times declined, we thought that that was a healthy thing. And we're back at normalized delivery times as well as a normalized backlog. That's right. Yes. Yes. I would say, Dan, some of our end customers have had a really challenging time and shut down sites, and that has affected our volumes. We saw that in Q1, and it continued into Q2. As Mike, you're saying, we start anniversary-ing some of those in the back half of the year and expect it to perform better. But some of those are customer-specific. Yes. I mean, we typically do have some seasonality built into our results. If you not just looked at last year, but historically, our Q4 does have a typical ramp-up from Q3. And we're looking at it. If you look historically kind of how we're looking at the seasonality, that's kind of how we built it in. We are expecting stronger both revenue and order performance, Q4 relative to Q3, based on what we know today. Yes, I would say -- let me take the last one first. Our LSAG business, where we were assuming for the full year kind of mid-single-digit growth with it front-end loaded, we're now expecting low single digits, just above 0. So we're actually expecting a decline in both the second -- third quarter and fourth quarter for LSAG driven in part by the emerging biotech and the small molecule. In terms of the biopharma, biopharma actually in total grew 16% in the Q2 results, and that was benefited obviously from NASD. If you took NASD out, it was 11%. So what we saw was this change in the quarter, and we're assuming that change will stay pretty consistent in the back half of the year. Yes, super pleased with the performance of NASD. And as we look out to the second half of the year, we feel good about the performance and are excited about Train B coming online. And we're having conversations with customers as we look to fill that Train up. And what I would say is kind of stay tuned from that standpoint. But what I would say long term, we're extremely excited about this. That's why we're investing another $700 million in adding Train C and D as well. So we think that we're in the early stage of therapeutic discovery here in terms of RNA, siRNA-based therapies and there will just be more larger indications as those move through the clinic. Yes. So if you looked at our overall orders, they were down low single digits. As Mike mentioned, ACG and DDG grew and LSAG was down mid- to high single digits in the quarter. And as I mentioned before, our guide contemplates a decline for LSAG in both Q3 and Q4. Yes. Just to build on what Mike is saying. Obviously, we've got -- we've been looking at discretionary spend, things like travel but also demand related. If there's not demand, we're not going to spend the same level of marketing funds as an example. And we continue to really drive productivity. We talked about that at the very beginning of the year around productivity in our workforce, and we'll continue to do that, making sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves in terms of adding more people relative to the business. Sure. And on orders, Josh, we won't disclose individual product lines. But as I mentioned, the order growth for LSAG was down mid to high, and they were higher than that. The decline was greater than the average. Yes. I think, Josh, the one thing that we did see, and we talked about this at the beginning of the year because there was a lot of talk about the stimulus. That stimulus was targeted at higher-end applications and instrumentation that we don't necessarily have the product portfolio or compete in. And so I don't think that has moved budgets, but it created a stimulus for potentially areas that we're not as exposed to as maybe some other players in the marketplace. Yes, sure. So Liza, if you looked at that in isolation, actually, there is margin compression, given the Train B startup. But we've taken that into account. We had that in our initial guide, and that's money. That's good money to spend because we've got a lot of opportunity there. And so the cost savings that we've been talking about is really not in that area. It's in the other parts of the business. That's correct. That's correct. It was actually a little over 4% for Q2. You're quite welcome."

            "content": "Yes. Absolutely, Mike. And thank you for the question. What we found is that when you think about translational research, we've already talked about pharma here also as it's used in genomics and diagnostic testing too. There's just become a slowness in decision making, not only in instruments, but even in the usage of consumables particularly on the instruments. I will tell you that even within the quarter, our NGS QC backlog for consumables related to NGS QC, that's actually grown and our orders have grown. So we're doing well there. But there has been a slowness that we're seeing that's broad-based. And to answer your question about share, we don't believe that we're losing share. Similar to what you've heard about the instrument, it's not that we're losing orders at the time in which the orders are being placed. It is just being lengthened. And in U.S. in particular, a little bit in China is where we're seeing the impact."

            "name": "Jacob Thaysen",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely, and thanks for the question. I mean, first of all, we continue to see good market share gain in the LC business. And we see that, as Mike was mentioning also, over the last year, we have really seen a high growth in the LC business over many of our end markets. Obviously, being fueled significantly in the pharma, both small and large molecules. And as both Mike and Bob was talking about, these markets are changing right now. So while we will see a change in the market dynamics and thereby also some of the growth rates, the strategy have been in place from LCMS and pretty much the whole portfolio has been to build these workflows that is based on robust reliable instruments and really solution-oriented. And we expect and we see that this is what our customers are looking for. And hence, I'm expecting that while the markets are down, we will continue to see market share gain in this business and also in the LCMS business. Yes, absolutely. I think that we are still in the -- to use the baseball term, the early innings. I think I am, but we certainly are early innings here. We have been -- we've seen a lot of growth last year, and we continue to see it. Obviously, right now, since there's also a lot of funding through the government, it's a little bit lumpy. But if you look at for the long horizon, this is a huge opportunity for us, and we have a very strong position with our LCMS business here. And we're also seeing it expanding into new areas with the DCMS business. So I'm still very bullish on that, and we continue to see a lot of business here. Yes, you're absolutely right, Mike. I mean there's a lot of things going on here in U.S., and there's been regulation in certain states right now, but it's driven by regulation. So when regulations go onboard and online in different countries, you see a step-up in that. So there's definitely more to come here."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Padraig McDonnell",
            "content": "Yes. Look, I think the breadth of product offerings across many of the hardware platforms enables us to add all types of customer -- all types of customer operations. And what we're seeing is extremely strong demand for our services as utilization of the installed base happens. And in particular, we're seeing lab-wide enterprise service offerings, a big demand for that where we're helping customers with their efficiency, their asset management and so on. So I think it's a very durable business, and I think it's going to continue to be durable over that time frame. I would also say, Mike, we still have a big opportunity to attach our service contracts onto the business. And of course, as we go through this cycle, we continue to accelerate that. Yes. And I would add, Mike, the approval levels that we're seeing are going up and up and at the highest levels within pharma accounts are making decisions on capital purchase. So a lot of caution is around that. Yes. No, I think you said it well, Mike. It's a very similar dynamics in China from what we're seeing in the rest of the world, which is quite simply customers have become more conservative CapEx budgets and spending decisions, albeit on the EV markets and so on, that's a particular strength that we're going to continue to see. But I think that's what we're seeing. Yes. Yes. No. Look, I think you're right, Mike. I think the customer activity remains high. I think one thing that we've really seen is no uptick in cancellations whatsoever. Funnels remain intact. And actually, we're adding fresh funnel in certain cases. So I think it's really a case of slower deal velocity."

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks, Parmeet, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. In our call today, I'd like to first cover our second quarter results. I'll then provide some insight into the recent market dynamics that we are seeing and how this has translated into lower expectations for the second half of this year. I'll then turn things over to Bob for more detail on the quarter and outlook before returning for some brief closing comments. In an increasingly challenging market environment, the Agilent team delivered very solid results in the second quarter. Revenues of $1.72 billion are up 9.5% core above our expectations with growth across all end markets and regions. Our results are driven by an innovative and broad portfolio, a differentiated customer experience and outstanding execution by the Agilent team. Operating margin for the quarter 25.6%, up 30 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.27 are up 12%. Highlights from an end market perspective include our two largest markets, pharma and chemicals and advanced materials performing very well in the quarter. Our pharma business grew 6% on top of 13% growth last year. Pharma was led by biopharma, which grew 16% driven by lab services, consumables and our NASD business, while small molecule declined 1%. In previous calls, we talked about the small molecule replacement cycle and that the exceptional double-digit growth rates we've seen in the past two years would eventually moderate, which is what we started to see this quarter. Our chemicals and advanced materials business delivered strong results once again growing 16%. The advanced materials segment grew more than 20% and the chemical and energy segment grew double digits. On a geographic basis, 32% growth in China exceeded our high expectations. While the compare was an easier one, even adjusting for the COVID lockdowns in Shanghai a year ago, we still achieved double-digit growth in China. In addition, Europe delivered 5% core growth, while Americas grew 3%, albeit against a tough compare of 13% a year ago. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets group delivered revenues of $968 million, up 10% core. Our strong results were aided by backlog conversion across our instrument platforms. Our LC and LCMS products continued to lead the way with 16% growth in the quarter with strength across all end markets. Continued demand for lab consumables led to 13% growth in that business as well. During the quarter, we added additional strength to our LCMS product line by acquiring e-MSion and their innovative electron capture technology. e-MSion technology allows researchers to develop biotherapeutic products more quickly for treating disease. Agilent's LSAG team continued to bring several innovative new products to market, including enhancements to our Bravo NGS automation, Cary UV-Vis and the cell analysis NovoCyte systems. Many of these enhancements are specifically focused on serving our customers in the biopharma market. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenues of $387 million. This is up 13% core driven by strong revenues from service contracts. ACG's growth was broad-based, representing ongoing resilient demand for our services. We continue to see many opportunities for future growth given our services portfolio. In particular, the benefits of our service offerings as they help customers drive productivity in lab are even more relevant in today's challenging environment. Our strong and trusted customer support is also helping us to drive share gains and acquire new enterprise customers. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $362 million, up 3% core. Strength in our pathology and NASD businesses drove growth, partially offset by general industry-wide weakness in genomics. NASD posted another strong quarter growing in the high 20s. Our Train B manufacturing expansion remains on track to come online later this quarter, while construction has already started on the next phase of expansion. Overall, we wrapped up Agilent's first half of fiscal 2023 with double-digit core growth in both revenue and earnings per share. However, continued macroeconomic uncertainty, coupled with stresses in the banking system have accelerated a more conservative approach from our customers across the globe. This has primarily affected CapEx-related instrument spending across most end markets but are centered mainly in the pharma markets in the U.S. and China. Early stage biotech customers, while a small part of our revenues, dramatically scaled back purchases as funding and liquidity challenges drove cash conservation. Outside of these early-stage biotechs, the order funnel continues to be healthy, but it has taken a longer time for order to be approved, slowing deal velocity and generation of new orders. We expect this constrained capital environment to remain in place throughout the course of our fiscal year. Because of these factors, we are taking a more cautious approach to the second half and have revised our forecast downward. As a result, we now expect core revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4.5%, with EPS growing faster than revenue at 7% to 8%. Our operating margin increased in the first half of the year and we're doubling down on delivering cost efficiencies and increasing productivity to drive more leveraged earnings growth in the second half. As we've done in the past, we will generate additional cost savings so we can continue to invest in innovative new solutions and support for our customers as we enable future profitable growth. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that is battle-tested. They consistently execute at extremely high level and are well prepared to deal with any challenges they may face. Bob will provide the details on our outlook for Q3 and the full year, but overall, we remain convinced our strategic focus, customer service and unmatched execution of the Agilent team remain the keys to our continued success. After Bob delivers his comments, I'll be back to provide some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you. Thanks, Bob. During Q4 '22 call in November, I shared with you that I believe Agilent has the right growth strategies, the right team and right culture to continue delivering strong above-market results. My belief remains unchanged. Our customers know we are reliable, resilient and extremely quick in reacting to meet their needs. The Agilent team continues to work hard to earn their trust. While the near-term outlook points to continuing challenges in the market, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects in our end markets and our ability to continue to grow faster than the market. As a trusted partner that our customers know they can rely on, despite the current market environment, I remain confident in our ability to deliver on our shareholder value creation model. Our core values and approach haven't changed. Our focus on investing for growth, providing the industry's best customer support, our innovation prowess and being a great place for our team to work with a differentiated company culture are here to stay. They remain Agilent's formula for long-term success. Thank you. And now to you, Parmeet, to lead the question-and-answer session. Parmeet? Good afternoon, Brandon. Sure. Happy to do so, Brandon. So I think there are differences between the two sectors. The small biotech is pretty much shut down. We've seen real efforts on cash conservation as they've been dealing with the financing challenges of less venture capital money out there, banking crises and limited access to the IPO market. But on the medium-sized and large pharma companies, we still see a very -- actually, an increasing level of conservatism coming from new capital investments, particularly as it relates to our business in instruments. You can make a case that perhaps, there'll be a year-end budget flush, if customers go to try to spend their year-end money that they're not spending now. We're not assuming that because all we can really comment on right now is what we're seeing today. We're not giving any indications that that situation will change. And I think what remains to be seen is, I think it's going to be a CEO/CFO decision at our larger pharma companies about how they'll handle their full year budgets. And again, that relates primarily to the instrument side of our business. As we commented in our prepared remarks, consumables and services continued -- demand continued quite strong in these marketplaces. Anything else to add to that? Bob, one thing I forgot to mention as well is we aren't hearing the budgets are being cut. But the timeline, as Bob mentioned, are extended, and we're often here -- often at higher levels of approval as well within our customer base. Yes. Sure, Brandon. No, you may recall earlier this year, we really were pointing to Europe as a watch area, particularly Western Europe. I have to say, we continue to point to it as a watch area, but we've been pleased with the results to date. We are seeing signs of increased cautiousness on the chemical side of our customer base in Europe, but advanced materials continues to be -- demand there. And we're pleased with how the business is holding up right now. Sure. So there's a lot to unpack there. Bob, so you and I maybe can tag team on this. But let's first of all talk about the pace of business. So as you're right, Vijay, it really is a tale of two cities. I mean, look at how we performed for the first half, double-digit core growth, double-digit EPS growth, continued margin expansion. But we saw -- and we have been signaling a level of cautiousness in our customer base, and we talked about the uncertainty that was assumed in our second half guide. We've been talking about that for a few quarters. But what I would tell you is that we actually started and it's really a late quarter phenomena. We started to see a little bit maybe the last week or so of March, really centered in April, where the level of caution from our customers increased. Deal cycles were continuing to get further pushed out, deals weren't closing. And that really was the reason for the push in terms of downward guide for the second half. What I can tell you, what we're seeing so far through May, I think that was also one of your questions, is mid-May today orders, if you will, are tracking towards our revised order expectation. We haven't -- we've been through these cycles before in terms of downturns. These are always hard to predict because it's always hard to know exactly when the cycle started. But our experience is at least 12-month kind of cycles, 12 to 18 months. So -- and I think that's really the question that we need to work through here in the next few quarters. And again, as Bob and I have said in the past, we take one quarter at a time. And what we're trying to do here is comment to you today is what we're seeing today in the marketplace, and it's a level of increased cautiousness on capital deployment. I was just going to say too, Bob, I think it's fair to say relative to our guide assumptions, we're mainly looking at the pharma market. Although this level of cautiousness -- the increased level of cautiousness we're seeing is really across all end market segments, but really centered in pharma. And Vijay, I'd also point out there is a level of variability in our pay plans tied directly to adjust for the company's performance that are assumed in our guide for second half. Yes. Why don't I start out with answering the last question first, and then I'll probably mention to you, Bob, to our guide assumptions. But in terms of -- I think you mentioned the new COVID wave, we've not considered that into our second half guide, and I don't believe we would because we have experienced pretty significant COVID waves throughout the years. And as we've shown each quarter, we can very easily -- not easily, but we can navigate through that. In fact, that was a storyboard that you may recall from Q1 of this year. Relative to stimulus, we've been on record and the story remains the same as we've seen no material impact from China stimulus, which, in fact, we understand was closed off at the end of -- in February. And that initial stimulus program from our understanding was really focused on more on the high-end research space, things such as NMRs and SEMs, products where we don't have an offering or compete. So we're not seeing much happening at all on our front relative to stimulus. Now there is some discussion in the marketplace that maybe there's another one coming. If that would occur, that would be upside to our forecast for the year as we're assuming really no change in the current environment and no stimulus is assumed in our second half guide. And Bob, I know we've made some adjustments to the outlook for China for the year? So maybe we start with the biotech and NASD business questions first. So no impact at all in our NASD business. I think, Sam, we can say that pretty equivocally, right? And your last question is the toughest question, which is, sort of, if you will, your crystal ball question. We've typically seen 12- to 18-month kind of cycles historically. And as Jacob and I and Bob have talked in the past, we've always felt that this is more of a mid-single-digit kind of growth market with -- for instruments, which is still very healthy end market growth rate and particularly when you build around at the service and consumables piece. We're not calling for that yet to occur for this year. So I think the only other thing I would say is for a large majority of our instrument business it is a replacement cycle. We've talked about that time and time again. And so these products are in the installed base. They will have to be replaced. The question is when. And again, interest and demand remains high. I mean, our backlog is strong. As we mentioned in prior calls, and I just -- we emphasized that again today. Quality backlog remains high, no significant order cancellations and as Padraig likes to say, we're adding fresh funnel to the backlog. So it points to future demand, but we're just not seeing indications of when their buying behaviors are going to change. It's a great question. And Bob, I think that's actually what we've assumed in our full year guide. So maybe you want to share some of the specifics? Yes. I think durability is the right word to use here, Padraig and Matt. And this is a resilient part of our company's portfolio. We've talked about these recurring revenue businesses. And I think the story here is even bigger, Padraig, than extension of instrument life as people are deferring replacement purchases. We also believe we've been picking up share and particularly been doing really nicely job on the enterprise level. Rachel, thanks for the question. As you know, we don't report on book-to-bill, but what we can use is how to qualitatively describe the backlog and I think we used the word normalized backlog from the elevated levels we have seen in the quarter. So we're at a normal level of backlog in terms of month supply. So -- and we've been talking about this movement towards normalization in terms of the backlog, and we're there now. Yes. Bob, I think we did have some pretty tough compares in terms of our prior year order growth. But -- and I think ACG and DGG continued to grow in the quarter. Yes, I'm going to pull Jacob into this call, but he has had an opportunity to join in the conversation. But I think the storyboard here for LC is very consistent with the overall macro environment we described, which is an increasingly cautious set of decisions being made by customers relative to new instrument purchases. And as you know, we've been talking for some quarters about the moderation we were expecting to see in small molecule LC placements, that the 20-plus growth rates that the industry have been seeing for a number of quarters, would actually see a level of moderation start to occur. And that's what we saw in this recent quarter, and we would expect to see that continue throughout this year. And perhaps, you want to add some of your thoughts here as well, Jacob, and then take on the question about market share as well. Yes. I don't think you can point to Silicon Valley, but you can point to the pressure that the pharma companies run relative to their P&Ls, and they're cautious. They're really cautious about deploying new capital. And it's... Yes. And Dan, I have to say in all transparency, it's a little bit hard to figure out, right, because we had a similar thesis, which was the markets would be more resilient. Although we expect with some level of pressure as we assumed in our second half guide, a little more resilient in the face of slowing GDP. But things have -- obviously, things have moved more quickly than we had anticipated. And this level of increased costs was something we've seen in the last probably four to six weeks. And it's difficult to figure out from the standpoint is there's no obvious external catalyst. We just know we're seeing it across a broad section of our customer base. Yes. So I'm going to invite Sam on to this, but I think what you'll hear from him is he'll talk to you about it's a U.S.-centric phenomenon, not a market share issue. And there is that level of CapEx there that's on the instrument side that we're feeling a bit as well. We are assuming a level of improvement in our genomics business in the second half in our guidance I'll recall, Bob, and not full recovery, but improvement. Sure. Bob and I think we've got a realistic forecast here. And that's why we're asking to think about guidance in the midpoint. We had already assumed some level of slower capital investment in those end markets in our previous guide. So there really is no change to that. We think that outside of maybe the chemical side of CAM, those other end markets will hold up relative to our guide expectations. And listen, we've had experience in these cycles before. And Mike, one of the things I wanted to mention earlier to a previous caller's question was, we know when the market is low. This is actually when the Agilent team even shines further. We always gain market share in down markets. So I'm absolutely convinced you heard in my prepared remarks that we're going to come out of this thing stronger. I think the only debate is how long the cycle is going to be. Of course, you will take that one. Absolutely. You're welcome. Yes, sure. Maybe I'll tag team with you, Padraig, on this one. So as Bob mentioned, even adjusting for the Shanghai shutdown last year, we did 10% core in China in Q2. We are bumping up some pretty hefty comparisons, 29% and 44%, if I remember the numbers correctly, for Q3 and Q4. But I would say that the China market is really reflective of what we're seeing in the United States as well. So it's our pharma customers in China. It's our chemical customers in China, albeit the advanced materials piece of the China market continues to hold up quite nicely. And Padraig, I know you've been in conversations with our China sales leader. What are you hearing from them? I think we remain very positive on that, Jacob, right? Yes, American baseball terms. And Jack, I think it's also fair to say it's primarily a U.S. and a little bit European phenomena. We've got to see really new ranks being deployed and implemented in China and Japan, which down the road could be a source of continued growth on a global basis. Yes, sure. We want to give you some additional insights, Bob, so I think you've got some? Yes. Thanks for the question. I'm really glad to address this head on. So because you hit one of the key messages, we still are very positive on the long-term growth opportunities in these markets we serve. We think we're in a pause in certain segments of our market, but we remain very bullish on the long-term end markets. And the trick here is to make sure you're doing the right thing to manage the business in the short run in terms of being able to deliver leveraged earnings growth for our shareholders, and that's why I talked about the confidence we have in our shareholder value creation model. But at the same point in time, make sure that we don't cut off things that are going to get in the way of our long-term growth. And we know how to do this. We've done this before. We've got some variable pay programs. We have things we look at relative to travel and other things that are associated with expense, things that aren't necessarily immediately near-term revenue generating. And then what we'll do is we'll prioritize. We'll make sure that we're focusing on the sustaining our ability to realize the growth opportunities in a lot of these businesses, which are growing right now. One thing that came out today is it's a story of the multiple growth drivers across Agilent. Clearly, we're having some near-term challenges right now in analytical instrumentation business, yet pathology is growing well. NSE is growing well, services, consumables. So we've got a pretty rigorous program. And what I can assure you is that we will make the reductions in areas that we don't think will get in the way of our ability to continue to sustain what we believe to be out market growth. And Bob, I know you put a lot of thought and time on this, but we've already been activating a lot of the software already. So we didn't wait to the earnings call to get started on this, but I know that we think there's a path forward here for us. Yes, I want to tag team with Padraig on this, and then I'll go back to the order question to Bob. But yes, I mean, what we're hearing or I heard directly is customers aren't cutting their budgets. And I happened to be in Europe last month at our demo facility in Vauban, Germany. It's fully booked for the next three months. I mean -- so there's a lot of interest, a lot of interest in Agilent solutions. We just can't get the PEOs through their approval process inside their companies. And that's why we think it's transitory, although we have to acknowledge what we're seeing today, and that's reflective of the revised guide for the second half. I think there's no real significant difference between some segments of the overall pharma market. And I think the -- and Padraig, correct me if I'm wrong, I think the overall sentiment is economic uncertainty and just being cautious. It's a -- it's like I said earlier, it's a hard one to initially figure out because there's no obvious external catalysts because we deal with this. But -- this is what we're seeing, and we just thought it was important to share that directly on the call today. You're quite welcome. Bob, do you want to take that? ."

The Agent team delivered an excellent start to 2023, exceeding both top and bottom line expectations. Q1 revenues of $1.76 billion or up 10% core. Agilent's broad-based portfolio and resilient growth model are on a full display during the quarter with growth across all end markets and geographic regions. Operating margin in the quarter are 27.1%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.37 were up 13%. Let's now take a closer look at our first quarter performance, starting with end market highlights. Chemicals and Advanced materials led the way for us with another outstanding quarter, delivering 14% core growth with strength across all geographies. The strength in our pharma business continues and is up 11%, with both large and small molecule growing nicely. This is on top of 17% growth last year. Our environmental friend business grew 12%, while the academia government and the food markets both grew 8%. On a geographic basis, China once again led the way. Our China team continued their record of strong execution overcoming any disruption associated with COVID and delivered 13% growth during the quarter, exceeding our expectations. In Europe, we also delivered stronger-than-expected results, growing 10%. The Americas shows a solid results with 8% growth. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenues of $1.03 billion, up 11% core. LSAG delivered growth across all end markets and regions. Our LC and LC/MS platforms continued their strong performance during the quarter, growing faster than the market at 16%. Demand in the chemicals and advanced materials end market continues to be strong. particularly for materials used in manufacturing semiconductors and batteries. Our Spectra business grew more than 20% in the quarter and we continue to strengthen our base in spectroscopy across multiple end markets. In Q1, we announced an appointment at the Insight200M. This system is used at checkpoints throughout the London Heathrow Airport to officially provide enhanced security and ensure passenger safety. The Asian Crosse group posted revenue of $381 million in Q1. This is up 13% core as the team continues to take advantage of record instrument placements over the past 2 years along with continued growth and attach rates. Across our team's deep knowledge of customer lab operations continues to drive consistently high levels of customer satisfaction. The breadth and diversity of our product offerings is driving record renewals for support contracts. At the same time, our Enterprise Services business continued its strong momentum, driving growth and converting competitive accounts. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $342 million, up 5% core. Our pathology-related business performed well with double-digit growth led by the Americas and Europe. NASD posted another strong quarter, growing 22%. Our Train B manufacturing expansion remains on track to come online mid-calendar year. In January, we announced an additional $725 million expansion of our NASD facility that will double our oligo manufacturing capacity. And 2 weeks ago, we are pleased to have the Governor of Colorado join us in our groundbreaking ceremony at the Frederick site. In addition to organic investments, we continue to invest externally in new technologies and partnerships. In the quarter, we welcomed the Avida Biomed team into Agilent, further enhancing our genomics capabilities. Avida is early-stage life sciences company designed to assist clinical researchers using NGS approach in the study of cancer. We also continue to partner with new technology platform companies to drive our solutions in the marketplace. This quarter, we announced a partnership with the Akoya Biosciences to combine our companion diagnostic and IHC workload expertise with their solution to drive multiplex tissue assay development for biopharma. In addition to these business group highlights, Agilent was again recognized among the top 100 most just companies in the U.S. by Just Capital and CNBC. As part of this announcement, we are very proud to be the leader in the medical equipment and services industry for our treatment of employees and focus on customer relations. The Agilent team navigated challenging market uncertainties in Q1 and yet once again produced excellent results. It was a great start to the year. Q1 was another outstanding example of the work we've done to build a resilient company with multiple growth drivers. Those growth drivers create through targeted investments that aim to expand and enhance our business in high-growth areas are the heart of our Build and Buy growth strategy. As we look ahead to Q2, we remain confident in the strength and resilience of our business. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that continues to execute at an extremely high level and is well prepared to deal with any challenges they face. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our full year core revenue and EPS guidance while also keeping a close eye on macroeconomic conditions. I will provide the detail on our overall outlook but overall, we remain convinced our strategic focus and unmatched execution capabilities will continue to drive strong results. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you.\nRobert McMahon: Thanks, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated full year guidance and initial guidance for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are extremely pleased with our Q1 performance. It was a very solid start to the year. Q1 revenue was $1.76 billion, exceeding our expectations. Revenues were up 10% core and 5% on a reported basis. Currency was a 5-point headwind which was an improvement from the beginning of the quarter, while the M&A contribution was as we expected. Pricing for the quarter was higher than the full year forecast also as we expected. Now I'd like to share some additional detail on our end markets. Results in our largest market, pharma were again very strong. Pharma grew 11% following 17% growth of last year. Performance was solid across both small and large molecules. Small molecule grew 12%, while large molecule grew 9%. And as Mike mentioned, Chemicals and Advanced Materials also continued to be very strong, growing 14% during the quarter on top of 15% growth last year. The chemical and energy subsegments of the market are doing well while the advanced materials market continues to deliver outsized growth. Semiconductors and batteries are driving demand, helped by government investment in this area. The food market grew 8% during the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in China. The environmental and forensics business grew 12%, led by the Americas as increased testing for PFAS chemicals drives customer investment in this area and recently approved U.S. legislation leads to broad spending in the environmental market. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 4% versus 11% growth last year. Pathology led the way for us here, partially offset by industry-wide challenges in the genomics market. And the academia and government market was up 8%, led by LCs and services. Regionally, Europe and Asia showed strong results. On a geographic basis, the China team delivered 13% growth and Europe grew 10%, both exceeding expectations. The Americas had another solid quarter coming in at 8%, in line with our expectations. Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.5%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. The gross margin performance, coupled with good cost discipline and SG&A helped drive our operating margin to 27.1%, up 80 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 13.75% for the quarter and we had 297 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. And putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.37, up 13% from a year ago. In summary, Q1 ended with 10% core top line growth and 13% earnings per share growth, a very good start to the year. Now some metrics on cash flow and our balance sheet. In Q1, we generated $296 million in operating cash flow, up 16% versus last year, while investing $76 million in CapEx. CapEx spending continues to be driven by our scale-up of our Train B manufacturing line and other capacity expansion projects. In the quarter, we returned $142 million to shareholders through $67 million in dividends and by repurchasing shares worth $75 million. We also announced we're increasing our dividend by 7%, along with a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization continuing our successful balanced approach to capital deployment. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.8. Now let's move to our revised outlook for the year and the upcoming quarter. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic and interest rates and currencies continue to be volatile. However, given the good start to the year, we are increasing our full year revenue to a range of $7.03 billion to $7.10 billion. This increase updates our full year core revenue guidance to a range of 5.5% to 6.5%, increasing the midpoint of our guidance to 6%. We've also seen the dollar weaken against major currencies in the first quarter although it has rebounded somewhat in February. And as a result, the full year guide reflects $100 million of favorable currency movements since our initial guide in November. And for the full year, we still expect currency to be an almost 300 basis point headwind to reported growth. In addition, we're also raising our full year EPS guidance to a new range of $5.65 to $5.70 per share. And lastly, given the recently announced NASD expansion to double our oligo manufacturing capacity -- we are updating our forecasted capital spending for the year to $500 million, up $200 million from our guidance at the beginning of the year. Now turning to Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.680 billion. This represents core growth of 6% to 7.5% and reported growth of 3% to 4.5%. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 3.1 points, while M&A will contribute 0.1 points of growth in Q2 which is consistent with Q1. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.24 and $1.27, representing growth of 10% to 12% versus the prior year. I'm pleased with how the team has delivered in the first quarter. We are focused on the things we can control. Our team is driving strong execution in the marketplace and coupled with our broad portfolio of products and services, we expect to continue to grow faster than the market as we go through the year. Thanks for being on the call. And now I'll turn over things back to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Bob. Bill, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We take our first question this afternoon from Matt Sykes of Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Sykes: Mike and Bob, maybe we'll start on ACG, just given the quarter that it had and the comp it was facing last year, you've talked in the past about areas of underpenetration. I think China was a region you called out. Could you just maybe kind of give us a mark-to-market on where you feel from sort of an end market and regional standpoint, there's still a lot of room for that growth in ACG if we see it continue throughout this year and into next?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Matt. First of all, I appreciate the recognition of the numbers we posted and we think there's still a lot more opportunity in front of us. And I want to actually have provide a little bit more color on where those opportunities may lie.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So look, I think the broad product offering across the hardware platforms where we've had a value to -- where we add a lot of value to customer operations has been broad-based. We certainly see a lot of our offerings, particularly around asset utilization and so on, being able to be used outside pharma in different industries and we see that as an opportunity to grow. I think also given our big installed base and our ability to attach in different markets and sectors is going to continue as we go through the year.\nMike McMullen: Yes, I think we see a lot of opportunity, obviously, in China. That's when we flagged in the past. The other one that we're pointing to is a lot of the growth has historically been centered in the pharma space. We're seeing growing interest in the CAM space as well. So I think from an end market perspective, that's an area we would expect to see some more growth. And geographically, the China story still hasn't fully played out yet. And then again, I would just remind you, Matt, some of the points we made in the call, record renewals for support contracts and also clearly taking share on the enterprise level. Those attach rates we keep talking about are going up as well. So a lot to like here.\nMatt Sykes: Great. And then maybe just kind of refresh us on your outlook for instruments. I mean you've kind of guided to a mid-single-digit growth for the full year. Given that we're a little ways into this year, you probably have a little more visibility on that backlog. How are you thinking about sort of the back half for instruments overall?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So first of all, let me -- I'm taking a bit on this with Bob but let's -- I'll talk about the backlog, first of all, I think it's very important to just to remind the audience that the quality of our backlog remains extremely high. So -- and you can see the great work of our team at to work down the backlog but we're not seeing any cancellations or anything pulling out of backlog. So that gives us level of confidence around the revenues we can forecast. I think there really isn't anything new to talk about today relative to new news relative to the second half, we still remain -- we still want to acknowledge the uncertainty about the back half of the year. So really no new news here. It's very consistent to what we talked about in November. I think you're going to hear a lot of us talking about normalization of growth rates -- normalization of deal cycle times. So the funnels remain healthy. The deal cycle times are I think we've already more towards historical levels. And Bob, I don't know if you'd add anything to that?\nRobert McMahon: No, I think you're right. I mean, I think, obviously, we had a very strong start to the year with double-digit growth from LSAG we will go up against very tough comps in the back half of the year with the recovery of the business. But as Mike said, pleased with the very good start but not anything material change.\nOperator: The next to Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.\nBrandon Couillard: Mike, I think you said China was up 13% in the quarter. That's a lot better than we've heard from some of the other counterparts. Could you unpack that a little bit for us? Could it perhaps have been due to the fact that you're 1 month later maybe talk about linearity in China through the quarter and if your outlook for the full year. So I think it was high single digits has changed at all.\nMike McMullen: Well, I'm glad you noticed, Brandon and if you were in the conference room here, you see there's a lot of smiling in the room here because really proud of what the team has done here. So I don't think it's all a timing issue. It's about execution and its ability of this team to execute because our teams were hit with waves of COVID during the quarter. But we know how to execute. We've also enabled the -- our ability to interact with customers digitally. So while people maybe couldn't go to the office or couldn't go to customer sites, they were able to support the customers. So we were just -- we were just delighted with the performance out of China in Q3. And Bob, I think it was a broad-based story. We had growth and double-digit growth in pharma, chem, food. So it was really pleased with the results. I know our narrative is different than others are saying but I also think my team in China capability is also different.\nBrandon Couillard: Got it. And then on the NASD Train C, I guess, expansion. Can you just talk about time line for that build-out. And as I remember back to Train B, I think a good amount of that was already kind of earmarked for customer demand. In the same case this time around with the current expansion.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I want to tag team a bit with this with Sam and myself and Bob. So we evenly refer to Train B. That's the latest expansion that's coming online this year. In fact, we had a chance to see that firsthand when we went to the groundbreaking ceremony for what we call Project endeavor or as you're referring to [indiscernible]; it looks really good. We're on track for that mid-calendar year go live and we have a full book of business for that just a matter of ramp. And again, project up. And then I'm going to pass it over to Sam and maybe you want to remind, Brandon, what our plans are with the new expansion, when we expect to see some of that first revenue coming into Agilent.\nSam Raha: Yes. Yes, happy to do so. And as you mentioned, Mike, first of all, we're tracking right on plan for Train B, right, midpoint -- midyear coming on. And it was great to see first-hand, Bob joined me really the progress that we're making, the facility is looking really, really nice. A lot of validation work happening miles and miles of stainless steel piping and other infrastructure that's been put in place. As you also noted, we did at the end of February, the middle of February, pardon me, the groundbreaking for trains, C and D. And these projects will take some time but we've started the process and the first revenue from that would be coming online in 2025. And remember, there's 2 trains, Train C and Train D, both dedicated to siRNA, antisense capabilities as well as expanding our ability to serve customers with single guide RNA or CRISPR. So excited about the progress in the NASD team under Brian Crude's leadership is firing in all cylinders.\nMike McMullen: Sam, unless you're going to commit to me for earlier to go live. I think you meant to say '26, right?\nSam Raha: Did I say '25? Thank you, Mike, for catching. Usually, you're the one that accelerates me instead of the other way. Indeed, it's '26. Thanks for catching that.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. And Brandon, to your point around the question of purchase orders and so forth. We have good visibility into the pipeline in the funnel but we haven't started taking orders given the time frame there. So we have high confidence that we wouldn't be putting in $725 million into the expansion.\nOperator: We're going next now to Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI.\nVijay Kumar: Congrats on a good print here, Mike. My first question here on the second quarter guidance, 6% to 7.5% organic. That's a sequential step down of 250 basis points at the high end. I guess the comps get easier. Is there anything in the second quarter? Was there any timing of revenues that got to fall to Q1? Or any China impact, anything that can explain here at the sequential guide for 2Q?\nMike McMullen: Yes. I'll pass this over to Bob for additional detail but I think the answer is no, not the unusual about movements between the quarters. And Bob, I think what we're going to do is we want to set up another guide in Q2 that was above our full year guide. So that was the process there.\nRobert McMahon: That's exactly right. I mean, I think as we look at this, we just came off a 10%, still 6% to 7.5% is still significantly above where we're forecasting the full year and I think we feel good and I think it's consistent with how we have guided in the past.\nMike McMullen: I have missed we're very prudent yet today, Bob?\nVijay Kumar: I was waiting for that, Mike. So have to say the second quarter is a prudent guide. Is that a fair comment?\nMike McMullen: That is correct.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. And then I did have one on this NASD, Mike -- at Novartis. I think they're pulling their API manufacturing in-house. And I know you're starting to train to see maybe provide some context and how big is Novartis as a customer? What's the pipeline looking in ASD and uses at risk?\nMike McMullen: Yes. I'll tag team on this. I'll lead and Sam, if you want to add some additional color. But first of all, the announcement from Novartis is no new news. We -- that has always been part of the plan and we actually have contractual agreements relative to how much of the on market demand we get. So that's all well known. But relative to the Novartis is one of the many customers we have in this business and we really have worked hard to build a diversified book of business. And we talk a lot about Novartis great customer. I talk a lot about Anylam because we're allowed to talk about those programs but we have a much broader base book of business. And I think that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward because we have a number of programs that we're supporting. We know not everyone is going to hit but we know that there's going to be a lot of success rates there as well. And Bob?\nRobert McMahon: Yes, let me just add something. I mean I would say this means nothing to our expansion. I mean or I want to be very clear about that. I mean I think we feel very good about -- we've continued to be capacity constrained. We've had more orders than we can satisfy. And I think that continues to be the case and we feel extremely good about the overall technology and our position in the marketplace.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Bob. I appreciate that build.\nSam Raha: Mike, if I can just add just a couple of quick things, right? We've stated this before. We think the therapeutic oligo market for the suppliers that we are $1 billion today, growing to $2.4 billion by 2027. And what's really encouraging about the market is the number of molecules that are advancing, right? Just to give you a little bit more color, we're doing work with over 30 pharma partners today and on dozens of programs at various stages. So the pipeline of programs are working on, some of which have the potential of being molecules also broad populations is absolutely there and something that we're excited about.\nOperator: We go next now to Puneet Souda of SVB.\nPuneet Souda: So first one, Bob, I don't know if I heard it on the call, contribution sort of from pricing in the quarter and for the full year. If I'm correct, you are still expecting 3% pricing contribution this year and that would imply a 3% volume contribution which it appears below historical levels for what Agilent has grown. So just maybe just -- we're trying to understand, given the tailwinds you're seeing in China, NASD and the other areas and obviously, congrats on the strong growth in the quarter. So is there anything you're seeing beyond sort of tougher compares that are emerging in the sort of the second half?\nRobert McMahon: No, it's a great question. So I did make a quick reference in the prepared remarks. Actually, Q1 was higher than the overall 3% as expected. We are still planning and forecasting that 3% price contribution for the full year of FY '23. And you're right, that would speak to roughly a 3-point volume. What I would say is we're taking it 1 quarter at a time. As we've said, we're dealing with -- looking forward, there's still some uncertainties around macro. And that's where I think our forecast and our guidance is prudent to use that word again. But I wouldn't say anything has materially changed since the beginning of the year from that standpoint. And I've been very pleased with our ability to continue to maintain that pricing throughout the course of the last several quarters and I would expect that to continue going forward.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the Lunar New Year, is that part of -- is that baked into the guide as well? And I just wanted to clarify on China. I mean obviously, you have heard about the stimulus, your -- actually Agilent is listed -- one of the companies listed within the document that was put out for the loan stimulus for China. This is sizable. How are you thinking about it? You obviously have the longest and one of the most legacy positions in China. So just trying to understand what does that mean for China growth in 2023 and '24.\nMike McMullen: You want to take the first part of the question.\nRobert McMahon: Sure. Yes. But the impact of Lunar New Year was not only in Q1 but it's also been reflected in our Q2. It was roughly 0.5 point headwind in Q1 and that's come back to us in Q2. So it was kind of as planned. And in regards to the stimulus, the way we're looking at this is Sims got kicked off in the calendar Q4. There is a section in there that's focused on equipment for universities and hospitals. But from our perspective, it's still early. So we're kind of waiting right now to see how it plays out. And but I think at this point, we really haven't put anything assumed in our guide or China growth relative to the stimulus. So if it does get deployed and comes to our way, then that will be an upside to our current forecast.\nMike McMullen: And I think Puneet, you said it well. I mean, our business in China continues to be very, very strong and I couldn't be prouder of the team, how they delivered in Q1 and that's continuing strong momentum throughout the second half of last year and we would expect that to continue here in Q2 as well.\nOperator: We go next now to Rachel Vatnsdal at JPM.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Congrats on the quarter. So first up on semiconductors, one of your peers have flagged that they were expecting the semiconductor market to be soft throughout 2023, just as semiconductors or semi customers were facing a reset just given a macro environment. So you mentioned strength in semi-dry prepared. So can you just walk us through, first off which part of the market do you guys really play in, in semis? And then are you seeing any of the softness that one of your peers have flagged?\nMike McMullen: Yes, I'll start and then we'll turn it over to Jacob to give some additional color about where we play and so forth. But I would say the short answer is no. I mean, our spectroscopy business grew over 20% in the quarter and we're still seeing strong demand. And Jacob, you want to provide a little more color?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, absolutely. We have -- I would say we have the strongest portfolio in atomic recopy for this market in semi but generally speaking, in material science. And we continue to see demand from the semicon industry, both in the fabs but also in the upstream for all the fine chemicals that goes into the fabs, they require the same level of QC testing like they do in the labs and hence, they are using the same instruments. So we see a lot of benefits. Those were the new fabs built but also for the continuous operation in the labs. So we expect this to continue for a while. We, of course, see a lot of news around investments into this in other parts of the world, also particularly in the U.S. Obviously, that will take some time before it comes into play. But we are -- we expect the whole semicon market to continue to be an upside for us. But as I mentioned also, we also see a lot of interest in the rest of the materials market, particularly in lithium batteries, where we see a lot of demand, not only for our spectroscopy business but really across our broad portfolio where lithium battery needs both the LCs, the GC, the spectroscopies and the CMS. So we are very excited about that space and see a lot of continued growth there.\nMike McMullen: And Jack, I think the point you made earlier, too, about some of the funding environment, we're seeing some government funding coming in from different parts of the world as part of the semiconductor industry which has benefited us.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then maybe just shifting over more towards pharma biotech. The small molecule grew faster than large molecule this quarter. You've talked in the past about some of that outpaced strength in small molecule being driven from spending related to instrument purchases that were delayed back in 2018, 2019 time frame. Can you walk us through really what inning are we in, in terms of that catch-up spend? And how long can you sustain an outpaced growth in small molecule before it kind of resets back to that normalized level? And then just update on large molecule as well.\nMike McMullen: Sure, Rachel, do I dare pass this question to the Danish member of the staff over that baseball analogy but I think, Jacob, got a great print on LC and LC/MS 17% growth, clearly outpacing the market. And I think we saw some really good strength in small molecule in particular this quarter.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, absolutely. I will start by saying, I don't think this is a baseball game. I think there is a continuous opportunity on indicate space. So -- and we see both opportunities and we continue to believe that there is a big market in small molecules. And I think the current performance is a reflection of the investments we have done into -- we made into our portfolio over the past years both for the LC and the CMS. So it's really, really focused very much on where we have gone strategically on a lot of investment into making robust reliable and routine instruments and instrument solutions. We continue to spend significant time to truly understand our customers' pain point that is not only about the overall performance but also about how you can ease of use, a lot of smarts we put into the instruments and of course, also continues on focus on uptime of instruments. And our commercial organization is brilliantly going out and connect both our consumables and also the service contracts to it. So this just continues to be a great business for Agilent.\nRobert McMahon: Yes, Rachel, maybe -- this is Bob, maybe I can add a few points because we talked at the beginning of the year, about this strong performance kind of normalizing this year. We also said if it continues, we're going to take it. And I think what you're seeing is some of that as well. But we still do think that this will normalize over time. And the portfolio that Jacob and team have I think speaks very well to us growing faster than the market. And I think you talked about the biopharma, the beauty of our business is we've got that nice diversification across both small -- and small and large molecule and certainly starting up the year very nicely.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Derik DeBruin [ph] of Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Peter [ph] on for Derik. Could you just dive a bit more into the latest on what you're seeing in Europe? You've expressed in bending some caution, particularly in Chem on the last call. So if you can touch on that as well, that would be great.\nMike McMullen: Yes. So I hope it came through in the call remarks and I'll make a few comments here, then invite organ here as well but we were delighted with the print in Europe in the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Actually, the strength across the marketplace was pretty good. I think 5 of our 6 end markets were growing high single digits or better. I think the standouts for us were actually the chem markets along with diagnostics. But I have to say we continue to watch closely the investment plans particularly for our large accounts in the chemical space as well as pharma space. But we're off to a really good start but that's -- that remains a watch area for us. But again, we're delighted with the broad-based growth we had. And I don't know if you...\nPadraig McDonnell: I think you said it all, Mike, I think it's broad-based in 5 out of 6 markets, growing high single digits. And I think what the team has been able to do has been able to really work together to take share in a lot of areas on all the markets and our focus, of course, on attach rates in both services and consumables has really benefited as well.\nMike McMullen: I think we don't talk about weather but I think the more favorable weather environment in Europe actually has put less pressure on customers relative to energy cost and energy demand. So that's been net positive but we're still keeping an eye on things.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then could you just discuss your margin outlook and then pacing across '23? What's kind of -- and then further ahead, kind of what's the level of expansion potential going forward? How much gas is left in the tank there, looking out in the out years?\nMike McMullen: You want to take that, Bob?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. I still have gas in the tank, yes. I mean I think, obviously, despite the inflationary environment that we're in, we're still able to manage growing our margins. You saw both a nice balance here this quarter with about half of it coming through gross margin as well as half of it coming through OpEx. I think as we think about it going forward, I think that 50 to 100 basis points over the course of the next several years is still a reasonable way to think about it. That's how we're thinking about the rest of this year as well.\nOperator: And we'll go next now to Dan Brennan of Cowen.\nDan Brennan: On the quarter -- maybe just the first maybe the first one, another a few questions asked on the Chemical and Advanced Materials segment. But obviously, great growth in the quarter. Just wondering, with your new higher guide for the year, are you assuming something above the mid-single-digit outlook that you previously guided to for the year? And would love if you can give us any color on kind of how the growth broke out this quarter between advanced material and then chemical and energy.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. That's -- it's a great question, Dan. I'll take that. And so with our revised guide, we have ticked it up a bit, given the strong performance that we had in Q1. And we continue to be surprised to the upside. When we talked about it at the beginning of the year, what was a source of upside. This would have been one of the markets that we would have talked about. And what we're seeing is actually good growth across all of the submarkets in our chem market. If I think about the chemical and energy markets, those were up high single digits and the growth was really outsized in that advanced materials that we've been talking about. So that semiconductor in batteries area grew in excess in the high 20s. And so this is a continued strength really given not only the investment there but really the power and strength of our portfolio to be able to supply critical tools and instrumentation into markets that are really continuing to expand. So we're expecting that don't book high single digits and the high 20s for the rest of the quarter, so we'll take it. But we're expecting a slight uptick there, given the strong performance that we had in Q1.\nDan Brennan: Great. And maybe just one on the balance sheet. Obviously, the -- it's in great shape, leverage is very low. Just wondering what you're seeing from the M&A environment. Obviously, Waters had a deal in the quarter. I'm wondering what you're seeing in terms of -- have you identified any interesting opportunities like what's the appetite like for sellers to kind of move forward? Just wondering what we could expect for management while it's always hard at time. I'm just kind of wondering about your appetite potential to do something bigger since you guys have been looking for the right fit.\nMike McMullen: Yes. No, I think you're closing -- happy to comment on the day your closing comments exactly where our head is at which is the right fit. So we think the environment is much more favorable than it was a year ago. We think it's now much more of a buyer's market, so to speak. Most people are willing to come off at a view of last round. There's still some dialogue around there. So we're -- we have obviously nothing to announce but we remain very interested in looking for opportunities that can augment our core organic business and this is at the heart of our build and buy growth strategy. As I've said a number of times, the buy side is all optionality for us. We'll do just fine with all the bets we have right now. But if we see the right thing, we will move on it. And we just have also just wanted to make sure we stuck with our framework and we don't ever want to have buyers remorse. So we've been very happy with all the deals we've done to date and we'll continue to use that framework moving forward. I think that fit piece that you described is really a key criteria for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly of Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Maybe one on just the order side. I know you guys talked a little bit about the backlog remaining pretty healthy. Can you just give a little bit of color in terms of what the order growth looked like in the quarter? I know last quarter, you guys started eating into the backlog a little bit which is natural, just given the supply chain is normalizing a little bit. Can you just talk about, I guess, order growth versus revenue growth, what you saw in the quarter? And any color there would be helpful.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Let me make some summary comments and then Bob, feel free to jump in here. But as you mentioned, we don't specifically provide book-to-bill ratios. But what I can tell you is that orders for the quarter were greater than revenue. So -- and so we continue to grow orders with particular strength in our ASD and the services business. On the instrument side, we continue to bring down this record backlog we had as we really are focused on meeting those customer shipment requirements and really thanks to the great work of the order fulfillment team, we've really been able to get back to a normal flow of shipment times and delivery commitments. Again, I would just say that the funnels remain healthy, the backlog is still a very high quality. I think we have pretty much next to no cancellations. So the quality is good. It gives Bob and I that level of predictability around revenue from that backlog.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. I would say, as Mike said, I mean, the backlog continues to be healthy and we haven't seen anyone back out of any cancellations or anything like that, that would be beyond kind of the normal activity.\nMike McMullen: But I would emphasize one point I made earlier, the deal cycles are reverting towards the historic norms in this space. Again, this whole construct that we see of a normalization of particularly the analytical instrumentation marketplace evolving.\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe just on kind of the environmental spend, PFAS testing. You've called out the last couple of quarters, Mike, I know you're excited to see some actual infrastructure dollars coming through in the U.S. here. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there, kind of where we are? I mean, it seems really early but just your perspective on kind of how that's tracking, what impact you guys are seeing from that and obviously, the durability as well.\nMike McMullen: Sure. Happy to talk about that. And I actually happen to have Jacob talk about it because I think you've just spent some time in front of the Board recently and talking about the PFAS opportunity. I don't want to educate the Board on what it's all about but the durability of growth we're seeing, we see here.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, absolutely. And we continue to see a lot of opportunities in the PFAS where at the beginning was really all about looking for PFAS in the water supply and now it's moving into food and other types of areas. So I think you are right, we are still in the early phases of the growth opportunity. As you know, the U.S. infrastructure build, there was a $4 billion set aside to PFAS testing. And so we have one of the leading solutions here. I mean PFAS is very difficult to measure. So you need high-end instrumentation but also very specified sample prep and consumables to really make sure that you don't contaminate why you measure. So we have spent a lot of energy of putting a high-quality solutions out there and we continue to see a lot of opportunities and we will continue to invest in this space beyond PFAS. I think environmental is really a place that there will be a lot of investment going in over the next decade. So really excited about that area also besides the Advanced Materials.\nOperator: And we'll go next now to Jack Meehan at Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Wanted to spend a little time on DGG. Maybe start with the pathology business. So double-digit growth was stronger than, I guess, what we've seen in the last few quarters. Was there anything you noticed in terms of the uptick in the quarter?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Jack, I'm going to actually pass that over to Sam because Sam actually is calling in from Denmark. He's actually with the pathology team right now. So you can get it latest and greatest on the ground from Glostrup. Go ahead, Sam.\nSam Raha: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Jack, thanks for the question. I'd offer you a couple of things that we've observed in the quarter and I think are also promising going forward. First of all, we continue to see the trend of hospitals and health care systems being able to work through COVID and start to reprioritize cancer diagnostics. So overall, I think that's been something that's positive. We've continued to see strength in our IHC solutions, be it our companion diagnostic solutions that are in the market. But more broadly speaking, including for the antibodies that we have, that we sell as ready-to-use reagents. We're also continuing to see good traction for our advanced staining system, the Dakotas. So all of that, you look at that geographically, we've had some good success, particularly in Europe but the Americas as well.\nJack Meehan: Great. And then sticking with DGG, either for you, Sam, or for Mike. Just on the genomics side, I was backing into sort of like a high-teens decline in the quarter, if that sounds right. I'm just curious, different companies have called out different issues in this end market. If you could talk about just maybe what exactly you're seeing, that would be great.\nMike McMullen: Bob, I don't remember the exact number but it was down but not to that extent.\nRobert McMahon: Yes, it was down close to double digits but not high teens.\nMike McMullen: Okay. And I'm going to have Sam talk about this but we're seeing some what we think is a transitory disruption in the diagnostics side of genomics that there's a lot going on with a lot of the diagnostic firms where we provide our solutions into their assays. So Sam, your perspective on the think would be really good.\nSam Raha: Yes, happy to provide that. And building on what you said, Mike, right, there's a lot of public information now that I'm sure, Jack, that you're aware of, it restructuring or other sort of operational challenges at a number of customers from research into technology-driven genomics companies and diagnostic testing companies are going through. Based on that, we've definitely seen conservatism from customers that they've pulled back on purchasing levels. They're working down excess safety stock that they perhaps have built up. And we've just seen a little bit of hesitation in purchase patterns. Now that being said, just recently, earlier in February, I had the chance to attend AGBT which is one of the most important technology and science conferences. And there, we definitely saw good interest for our early access that we've been doing for our SureSelect cancer CGP which is a comprehensive cancer panel 679 genes. We continue to see really good interest in our Magnus automation system which is the walk away for our SureSelect platform and our broad-based market leadership and genomics and NGS QC remains intact. So I think this is some market headwinds that we're seeing but it's just, I think, a transitory thing, as Mike mentioned.\nOperator: We take our next question now from Josh Waldman of Cleveland Research.\nJosh Waldman: For you -- two for you, if I may. First, on the core growth guide, I wondered if you could provide a bit more color on the considerations that went into reiterating the top end of the core growth outlook for the year. I guess, maybe a bit surprised, we didn't see more of the Q1 upside flow through to the full year. I'm wondering if maybe this is backlog work down benefit here in the quarter that starts to abate as we get into the second half for some, I guess, something else?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Bob, I'll let -- I think the headline is more just the recognition of the continued uncertainty about the back half but...\nRobert McMahon: Yes, I think the way to think about that, Josh, is we raised the midpoint of the guidance delivered 10% in Q1. We're saying that Q2 is going to be higher than the full year. And we're going to take this 1 quarter at a time, given some of the uncertainty that we're seeing. Obviously, we did talk about having great visibility into Q1 with some of the backlog activities and so forth. But I wouldn't say it was just that. I mean, I think what I would characterize it as a prudent guide given kind of what we're seeing and taking it 1 quarter at a time.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Okay. And then, Mike, following up on pharma, I think these accounts typically start to get better clarity on their full year budgets this time of year. Wondered if you could update us on what you're hearing from key pharma accounts with respect to instrument budgets and purchasing plans here in '23?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Sure, Josh. In fact, Padraig, I think you've just done recently around with some of the large pharma accounts and...\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So I think what we're seeing is our funnels are very, very stable on it. And of course, you're correct, the pharma budgets are set around this time of the year. And I think we're watching closely on how that moves to the second half but for now, no change.\nMike McMullen: So I think we probably haven't seen any surprises on those like themselves but they're not aggressively releasing yet either. I think that's -- that's why I made a few times on this call comments around normalization of deal cycle times.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question now from Lisa Garcia of UBS.\nLisa Garcia: Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to talk about sell analysis if we could. Obviously, it's like a $400 million business over for you at this point. I'd love to hear about performance. And then I think in a recent presentation, kind of indicated that it's pharma that's like maybe the largest customer set followed by research. So it would be great to get a sense of kind of the different customer groups and what you're seeing there?\nMike McMullen: It's hard to get all the good news in but I think we had a good start to the year at cell analysis, Jacob, as I recall?\nJacob Thaysen: Yes. We had another good quarter in sale analysis. Actually, we're really proud of what we build up of the business over the past years here in cell analysis in the M&A and the acquisitions we have done. And you're absolutely right that the main opportunities are within the biopharma academia and we've actually done a really good job in diversifying where we had some of the business we acquired was very exposed to academia and we've been able to really penetrate into the biopharma over the past years. So we continue to see opportunities and especially actually in the high end of the business that there's still a lot of opportunities in the biopharma space and especially in understanding the immune system, immuno-oncology, CAR-T and others is areas that we have put a lot of investments into and we see that pays off. So I believe there is still a lot of opportunities in front of us here. There is a strong correlation there in the biopharma academia space. There's a lot of collaborations where especially if you look into the CAR-T where you see a lot of the big university hospitals that is investing into this. So it's kind of a crossover between the academia and biopharma right now. So we see opportunities in both those areas right now.\nLisa Garcia: Awesome. And then I guess...\nRobert McMahon: Just one other comment. Just you had asked about kind of growth rates. What I would say is it grew faster than the overall company faster than LSAG.\nLisa Garcia: Awesome. Super helpful. I guess if I could just squeeze in one last one on the attachment rate. You're just crossed over the 30% line. I think I'm more thinking about kind of -- how do we think about kind of the incremental, particularly I'm thinking about services, ACG did pretty well this quarter. The revenue progression as we're looking at a larger installed base that's been put out over the past couple of years?\nMike McMullen: Yes. And I'll have you make some cost or part. But I think we're expecting the continued step-up in that attach rate.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I think there's significant opportunity to drive growth for our business and it's about at 1 point of attach rate is about $30 million annually. And we know our customers have adopted workflow solutions that a tight integration on the instruments. And that allows us, of course, with the 1 commercial organization to demonstrate the value and of course, attach more services and consumables. I will say if you think about what Jacob said about PFAS and biopharma, our focus on solution selling has really paid off. That's really driven attach rates. And I think our overall attach rate in both services and consumers are now in the low 30s and that represents a 2% increase and we expect that to grow as we move forward.\nMike McMullen: And as your question focused on the attach rate on services. But I'd be remiss not to have Jacob talked about what's going on in attach rate to consumers that ties in this workflow solutions because we did make some changes organizationally but the ACG strategy of driving connect rates and services and consumables remains intact.\nJacob Thaysen: Yes, exactly. And I think along what Padraig mentioned is that there's been a lot of investment from both the businesses and in commercial about driving connect rate also with consumables. And it's more about selling the full solution and hence, going out not only present an instrument but percent, the instrument is the consumables, informatics to go after as Padraig was mentioning, PFAS, other workflows in the biopharmas and really addressing -- we're starting to addressing the high-end parts of the market. And we've seen a significant uptake in our attach rates in our consumables and -- and I would say we are -- we will continue to see growth. We still have a long -- a lot of opportunities but I've been really impressed with the team to take it from the 20s up way beyond the 30s now.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Paul Knight of KeyBanc.\nPaul Knight: On the RNA or the oligo production business, it looks like we've had, I guess, 4 or 5 here in the last 4 years or so dominated by Alnylam and Novartis. I'm assuming that this customer count you talk to and project count is expanding well beyond that group of that customer. So my question really is what's your position in the market? Do you think you're the dominant vendor? And two, does this number of partners suggest you're going way beyond Novartis and Alnylam?\nMike McMullen: Paul, I'm really glad you hung on and got your question because very enthusiastic to answer that question. We have a much broader base of business beyond 2 very good customers but the programs go much, much, much broader than that.\nRobert McMahon: And we are the market leader.\nMike McMullen: Yes. We crossed over on the siRNA piece. We are clearly the market leader. We are going to be going after more aggressively the CRISPR space where we can't yet claim leadership. But overall, we've really -- with the capacity expansion, the continued great work of our team. We continue to gain market share. And from the math we're doing, we've now crossed over in the leader in the space.\nPaul Knight: So in fact, what you're really building out is the kind of market or the technological I guess, threshold we've now achieved. Is that fair to say?\nMike McMullen: I'm not sure I understand completely the question. But I think what we're doing is, I think I got it which is we're actually expanding our portfolio which is we're the leader in siRNA. We've got a broad base of business broad-based set of number of pharma customers. Over time, you hear more about those when their therapeutics come to market. but also we're expanding into the CRISPR area. We've got a small business there right now. We do really well. We just don't have all the capacity we need and that's part of the storyboard what we're doing, what we call Project Endeavor.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. And Paul, to build on what Mike was saying is not only are we expanding but I think just as importantly, the market is expanding. And so the Alnylams of the world were the pioneers of this technology or one of the pioneers. But if you look at the number of products that are in the clinic or compounds that are in the clinic, it goes well beyond the 2 customers that you just talked about.\nSam Raha: Rob, maybe just to add just a twitch color to that. The actual number of programs that are in various stages has literally doubled over the last 4 years. And then in terms of pharma partners, we're not in a position today to share anything publicly. But I already said we're working with more than 30 pharma partners. And I think what's encouraging for us is even within pharma, the caliber of the companies that have now entered and advancing molecules at various stages. So this is a market that is maturing the number of FDA approvals that have happened, European approvals that have happened. So there's momentum in the market. And we are -- we've worked hard to be the leaders in siRNA but there's momentum that's there for us to ride as well.\nOperator: Thank you. And gentlemen, it appears we have no further questions today. Parmeet, I'll hand things back to you for any closing comments.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Bill and thanks, everyone, for joining. With that, we would like to end the call for today. Have a great rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, Parmeet. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you again for joining and you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our updated full year guidance and initial guidance for the second quarter. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. We are extremely pleased with our Q1 performance. It was a very solid start to the year. Q1 revenue was $1.76 billion, exceeding our expectations. Revenues were up 10% core and 5% on a reported basis. Currency was a 5-point headwind which was an improvement from the beginning of the quarter, while the M&A contribution was as we expected. Pricing for the quarter was higher than the full year forecast also as we expected. Now I'd like to share some additional detail on our end markets. Results in our largest market, pharma were again very strong. Pharma grew 11% following 17% growth of last year. Performance was solid across both small and large molecules. Small molecule grew 12%, while large molecule grew 9%. And as Mike mentioned, Chemicals and Advanced Materials also continued to be very strong, growing 14% during the quarter on top of 15% growth last year. The chemical and energy subsegments of the market are doing well while the advanced materials market continues to deliver outsized growth. Semiconductors and batteries are driving demand, helped by government investment in this area. The food market grew 8% during the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in China. The environmental and forensics business grew 12%, led by the Americas as increased testing for PFAS chemicals drives customer investment in this area and recently approved U.S. legislation leads to broad spending in the environmental market. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market grew 4% versus 11% growth last year. Pathology led the way for us here, partially offset by industry-wide challenges in the genomics market. And the academia and government market was up 8%, led by LCs and services. Regionally, Europe and Asia showed strong results. On a geographic basis, the China team delivered 13% growth and Europe grew 10%, both exceeding expectations. The Americas had another solid quarter coming in at 8%, in line with our expectations. Now let's turn to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.5%, up 40 basis points from a year ago. The gross margin performance, coupled with good cost discipline and SG&A helped drive our operating margin to 27.1%, up 80 basis points from last year. Below the line, our tax rate was 13.75% for the quarter and we had 297 million diluted shares outstanding, both as expected. And putting it all together, earnings per share were $1.37, up 13% from a year ago. In summary, Q1 ended with 10% core top line growth and 13% earnings per share growth, a very good start to the year. Now some metrics on cash flow and our balance sheet. In Q1, we generated $296 million in operating cash flow, up 16% versus last year, while investing $76 million in CapEx. CapEx spending continues to be driven by our scale-up of our Train B manufacturing line and other capacity expansion projects. In the quarter, we returned $142 million to shareholders through $67 million in dividends and by repurchasing shares worth $75 million. We also announced we're increasing our dividend by 7%, along with a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization continuing our successful balanced approach to capital deployment. Our balance sheet continues to remain healthy as we ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 0.8. Now let's move to our revised outlook for the year and the upcoming quarter. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic and interest rates and currencies continue to be volatile. However, given the good start to the year, we are increasing our full year revenue to a range of $7.03 billion to $7.10 billion. This increase updates our full year core revenue guidance to a range of 5.5% to 6.5%, increasing the midpoint of our guidance to 6%. We've also seen the dollar weaken against major currencies in the first quarter although it has rebounded somewhat in February. And as a result, the full year guide reflects $100 million of favorable currency movements since our initial guide in November. And for the full year, we still expect currency to be an almost 300 basis point headwind to reported growth. In addition, we're also raising our full year EPS guidance to a new range of $5.65 to $5.70 per share. And lastly, given the recently announced NASD expansion to double our oligo manufacturing capacity -- we are updating our forecasted capital spending for the year to $500 million, up $200 million from our guidance at the beginning of the year. Now turning to Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $1.655 billion to $1.680 billion. This represents core growth of 6% to 7.5% and reported growth of 3% to 4.5%. Currency is expected to be a headwind of 3.1 points, while M&A will contribute 0.1 points of growth in Q2 which is consistent with Q1. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.24 and $1.27, representing growth of 10% to 12% versus the prior year. I'm pleased with how the team has delivered in the first quarter. We are focused on the things we can control. Our team is driving strong execution in the marketplace and coupled with our broad portfolio of products and services, we expect to continue to grow faster than the market as we go through the year. Thanks for being on the call. And now I'll turn over things back to Parmeet as we take your questions. Parmeet? No, I think you're right. I mean, I think, obviously, we had a very strong start to the year with double-digit growth from LSAG we will go up against very tough comps in the back half of the year with the recovery of the business. But as Mike said, pleased with the very good start but not anything material change. Yes. And Brandon, to your point around the question of purchase orders and so forth. We have good visibility into the pipeline in the funnel but we haven't started taking orders given the time frame there. So we have high confidence that we wouldn't be putting in $725 million into the expansion. That's exactly right. I mean, I think as we look at this, we just came off a 10%, still 6% to 7.5% is still significantly above where we're forecasting the full year and I think we feel good and I think it's consistent with how we have guided in the past. Yes, let me just add something. I mean I would say this means nothing to our expansion. I mean or I want to be very clear about that. I mean I think we feel very good about -- we've continued to be capacity constrained. We've had more orders than we can satisfy. And I think that continues to be the case and we feel extremely good about the overall technology and our position in the marketplace. No, it's a great question. So I did make a quick reference in the prepared remarks. Actually, Q1 was higher than the overall 3% as expected. We are still planning and forecasting that 3% price contribution for the full year of FY '23. And you're right, that would speak to roughly a 3-point volume. What I would say is we're taking it 1 quarter at a time. As we've said, we're dealing with -- looking forward, there's still some uncertainties around macro. And that's where I think our forecast and our guidance is prudent to use that word again. But I wouldn't say anything has materially changed since the beginning of the year from that standpoint. And I've been very pleased with our ability to continue to maintain that pricing throughout the course of the last several quarters and I would expect that to continue going forward. Sure. Yes. But the impact of Lunar New Year was not only in Q1 but it's also been reflected in our Q2. It was roughly 0.5 point headwind in Q1 and that's come back to us in Q2. So it was kind of as planned. And in regards to the stimulus, the way we're looking at this is Sims got kicked off in the calendar Q4. There is a section in there that's focused on equipment for universities and hospitals. But from our perspective, it's still early. So we're kind of waiting right now to see how it plays out. And but I think at this point, we really haven't put anything assumed in our guide or China growth relative to the stimulus. So if it does get deployed and comes to our way, then that will be an upside to our current forecast. Yes, Rachel, maybe -- this is Bob, maybe I can add a few points because we talked at the beginning of the year, about this strong performance kind of normalizing this year. We also said if it continues, we're going to take it. And I think what you're seeing is some of that as well. But we still do think that this will normalize over time. And the portfolio that Jacob and team have I think speaks very well to us growing faster than the market. And I think you talked about the biopharma, the beauty of our business is we've got that nice diversification across both small -- and small and large molecule and certainly starting up the year very nicely. Yes. I still have gas in the tank, yes. I mean I think, obviously, despite the inflationary environment that we're in, we're still able to manage growing our margins. You saw both a nice balance here this quarter with about half of it coming through gross margin as well as half of it coming through OpEx. I think as we think about it going forward, I think that 50 to 100 basis points over the course of the next several years is still a reasonable way to think about it. That's how we're thinking about the rest of this year as well. Yes. That's -- it's a great question, Dan. I'll take that. And so with our revised guide, we have ticked it up a bit, given the strong performance that we had in Q1. And we continue to be surprised to the upside. When we talked about it at the beginning of the year, what was a source of upside. This would have been one of the markets that we would have talked about. And what we're seeing is actually good growth across all of the submarkets in our chem market. If I think about the chemical and energy markets, those were up high single digits and the growth was really outsized in that advanced materials that we've been talking about. So that semiconductor in batteries area grew in excess in the high 20s. And so this is a continued strength really given not only the investment there but really the power and strength of our portfolio to be able to supply critical tools and instrumentation into markets that are really continuing to expand. So we're expecting that don't book high single digits and the high 20s for the rest of the quarter, so we'll take it. But we're expecting a slight uptick there, given the strong performance that we had in Q1. Yes. I would say, as Mike said, I mean, the backlog continues to be healthy and we haven't seen anyone back out of any cancellations or anything like that, that would be beyond kind of the normal activity. Yes, it was down close to double digits but not high teens. Yes, I think the way to think about that, Josh, is we raised the midpoint of the guidance delivered 10% in Q1. We're saying that Q2 is going to be higher than the full year. And we're going to take this 1 quarter at a time, given some of the uncertainty that we're seeing. Obviously, we did talk about having great visibility into Q1 with some of the backlog activities and so forth. But I wouldn't say it was just that. I mean, I think what I would characterize it as a prudent guide given kind of what we're seeing and taking it 1 quarter at a time. Just one other comment. Just you had asked about kind of growth rates. What I would say is it grew faster than the overall company faster than LSAG. And we are the market leader. Yes. And Paul, to build on what Mike was saying is not only are we expanding but I think just as importantly, the market is expanding. And so the Alnylams of the world were the pioneers of this technology or one of the pioneers. But if you look at the number of products that are in the clinic or compounds that are in the clinic, it goes well beyond the 2 customers that you just talked about."

            "name": "Sam Raha",
            "content": "Yes. Yes, happy to do so. And as you mentioned, Mike, first of all, we're tracking right on plan for Train B, right, midpoint -- midyear coming on. And it was great to see first-hand, Bob joined me really the progress that we're making, the facility is looking really, really nice. A lot of validation work happening miles and miles of stainless steel piping and other infrastructure that's been put in place. As you also noted, we did at the end of February, the middle of February, pardon me, the groundbreaking for trains, C and D. And these projects will take some time but we've started the process and the first revenue from that would be coming online in 2025. And remember, there's 2 trains, Train C and Train D, both dedicated to siRNA, antisense capabilities as well as expanding our ability to serve customers with single guide RNA or CRISPR. So excited about the progress in the NASD team under Brian Crude's leadership is firing in all cylinders. Did I say '25? Thank you, Mike, for catching. Usually, you're the one that accelerates me instead of the other way. Indeed, it's '26. Thanks for catching that. Mike, if I can just add just a couple of quick things, right? We've stated this before. We think the therapeutic oligo market for the suppliers that we are $1 billion today, growing to $2.4 billion by 2027. And what's really encouraging about the market is the number of molecules that are advancing, right? Just to give you a little bit more color, we're doing work with over 30 pharma partners today and on dozens of programs at various stages. So the pipeline of programs are working on, some of which have the potential of being molecules also broad populations is absolutely there and something that we're excited about. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Jack, thanks for the question. I'd offer you a couple of things that we've observed in the quarter and I think are also promising going forward. First of all, we continue to see the trend of hospitals and health care systems being able to work through COVID and start to reprioritize cancer diagnostics. So overall, I think that's been something that's positive. We've continued to see strength in our IHC solutions, be it our companion diagnostic solutions that are in the market. But more broadly speaking, including for the antibodies that we have, that we sell as ready-to-use reagents. We're also continuing to see good traction for our advanced staining system, the Dakotas. So all of that, you look at that geographically, we've had some good success, particularly in Europe but the Americas as well. Yes, happy to provide that. And building on what you said, Mike, right, there's a lot of public information now that I'm sure, Jack, that you're aware of, it restructuring or other sort of operational challenges at a number of customers from research into technology-driven genomics companies and diagnostic testing companies are going through. Based on that, we've definitely seen conservatism from customers that they've pulled back on purchasing levels. They're working down excess safety stock that they perhaps have built up. And we've just seen a little bit of hesitation in purchase patterns. Now that being said, just recently, earlier in February, I had the chance to attend AGBT which is one of the most important technology and science conferences. And there, we definitely saw good interest for our early access that we've been doing for our SureSelect cancer CGP which is a comprehensive cancer panel 679 genes. We continue to see really good interest in our Magnus automation system which is the walk away for our SureSelect platform and our broad-based market leadership and genomics and NGS QC remains intact. So I think this is some market headwinds that we're seeing but it's just, I think, a transitory thing, as Mike mentioned. Rob, maybe just to add just a twitch color to that. The actual number of programs that are in various stages has literally doubled over the last 4 years. And then in terms of pharma partners, we're not in a position today to share anything publicly. But I already said we're working with more than 30 pharma partners. And I think what's encouraging for us is even within pharma, the caliber of the companies that have now entered and advancing molecules at various stages. So this is a market that is maturing the number of FDA approvals that have happened, European approvals that have happened. So there's momentum in the market. And we are -- we've worked hard to be the leaders in siRNA but there's momentum that's there for us to ride as well."

            "name": "Jacob Thaysen",
            "content": "Yes, absolutely. We have -- I would say we have the strongest portfolio in atomic recopy for this market in semi but generally speaking, in material science. And we continue to see demand from the semicon industry, both in the fabs but also in the upstream for all the fine chemicals that goes into the fabs, they require the same level of QC testing like they do in the labs and hence, they are using the same instruments. So we see a lot of benefits. Those were the new fabs built but also for the continuous operation in the labs. So we expect this to continue for a while. We, of course, see a lot of news around investments into this in other parts of the world, also particularly in the U.S. Obviously, that will take some time before it comes into play. But we are -- we expect the whole semicon market to continue to be an upside for us. But as I mentioned also, we also see a lot of interest in the rest of the materials market, particularly in lithium batteries, where we see a lot of demand, not only for our spectroscopy business but really across our broad portfolio where lithium battery needs both the LCs, the GC, the spectroscopies and the CMS. So we are very excited about that space and see a lot of continued growth there. Yes, absolutely. I will start by saying, I don't think this is a baseball game. I think there is a continuous opportunity on indicate space. So -- and we see both opportunities and we continue to believe that there is a big market in small molecules. And I think the current performance is a reflection of the investments we have done into -- we made into our portfolio over the past years both for the LC and the CMS. So it's really, really focused very much on where we have gone strategically on a lot of investment into making robust reliable and routine instruments and instrument solutions. We continue to spend significant time to truly understand our customers' pain point that is not only about the overall performance but also about how you can ease of use, a lot of smarts we put into the instruments and of course, also continues on focus on uptime of instruments. And our commercial organization is brilliantly going out and connect both our consumables and also the service contracts to it. So this just continues to be a great business for Agilent. Yes, absolutely. And we continue to see a lot of opportunities in the PFAS where at the beginning was really all about looking for PFAS in the water supply and now it's moving into food and other types of areas. So I think you are right, we are still in the early phases of the growth opportunity. As you know, the U.S. infrastructure build, there was a $4 billion set aside to PFAS testing. And so we have one of the leading solutions here. I mean PFAS is very difficult to measure. So you need high-end instrumentation but also very specified sample prep and consumables to really make sure that you don't contaminate why you measure. So we have spent a lot of energy of putting a high-quality solutions out there and we continue to see a lot of opportunities and we will continue to invest in this space beyond PFAS. I think environmental is really a place that there will be a lot of investment going in over the next decade. So really excited about that area also besides the Advanced Materials. Yes. We had another good quarter in sale analysis. Actually, we're really proud of what we build up of the business over the past years here in cell analysis in the M&A and the acquisitions we have done. And you're absolutely right that the main opportunities are within the biopharma academia and we've actually done a really good job in diversifying where we had some of the business we acquired was very exposed to academia and we've been able to really penetrate into the biopharma over the past years. So we continue to see opportunities and especially actually in the high end of the business that there's still a lot of opportunities in the biopharma space and especially in understanding the immune system, immuno-oncology, CAR-T and others is areas that we have put a lot of investments into and we see that pays off. So I believe there is still a lot of opportunities in front of us here. There is a strong correlation there in the biopharma academia space. There's a lot of collaborations where especially if you look into the CAR-T where you see a lot of the big university hospitals that is investing into this. So it's kind of a crossover between the academia and biopharma right now. So we see opportunities in both those areas right now. Yes, exactly. And I think along what Padraig mentioned is that there's been a lot of investment from both the businesses and in commercial about driving connect rate also with consumables. And it's more about selling the full solution and hence, going out not only present an instrument but percent, the instrument is the consumables, informatics to go after as Padraig was mentioning, PFAS, other workflows in the biopharmas and really addressing -- we're starting to addressing the high-end parts of the market. And we've seen a significant uptake in our attach rates in our consumables and -- and I would say we are -- we will continue to see growth. We still have a long -- a lot of opportunities but I've been really impressed with the team to take it from the 20s up way beyond the 30s now."

            "name": "Padraig McDonnell",
            "content": "Yes. So look, I think the broad product offering across the hardware platforms where we've had a value to -- where we add a lot of value to customer operations has been broad-based. We certainly see a lot of our offerings, particularly around asset utilization and so on, being able to be used outside pharma in different industries and we see that as an opportunity to grow. I think also given our big installed base and our ability to attach in different markets and sectors is going to continue as we go through the year. I think you said it all, Mike, I think it's broad-based in 5 out of 6 markets, growing high single digits. And I think what the team has been able to do has been able to really work together to take share in a lot of areas on all the markets and our focus, of course, on attach rates in both services and consumables has really benefited as well. Yes. So I think what we're seeing is our funnels are very, very stable on it. And of course, you're correct, the pharma budgets are set around this time of the year. And I think we're watching closely on how that moves to the second half but for now, no change. Yes. I think there's significant opportunity to drive growth for our business and it's about at 1 point of attach rate is about $30 million annually. And we know our customers have adopted workflow solutions that a tight integration on the instruments. And that allows us, of course, with the 1 commercial organization to demonstrate the value and of course, attach more services and consumables. I will say if you think about what Jacob said about PFAS and biopharma, our focus on solution selling has really paid off. That's really driven attach rates. And I think our overall attach rate in both services and consumers are now in the low 30s and that represents a 2% increase and we expect that to grow as we move forward."

            "name": "Mike McMullen",
            "content": "Thanks, Parmeet. And thanks, everyone, for joining our call today. The Agent team delivered an excellent start to 2023, exceeding both top and bottom line expectations. Q1 revenues of $1.76 billion or up 10% core. Agilent's broad-based portfolio and resilient growth model are on a full display during the quarter with growth across all end markets and geographic regions. Operating margin in the quarter are 27.1%, up 80 basis points. Earnings per share of $1.37 were up 13%. Let's now take a closer look at our first quarter performance, starting with end market highlights. Chemicals and Advanced materials led the way for us with another outstanding quarter, delivering 14% core growth with strength across all geographies. The strength in our pharma business continues and is up 11%, with both large and small molecule growing nicely. This is on top of 17% growth last year. Our environmental friend business grew 12%, while the academia government and the food markets both grew 8%. On a geographic basis, China once again led the way. Our China team continued their record of strong execution overcoming any disruption associated with COVID and delivered 13% growth during the quarter, exceeding our expectations. In Europe, we also delivered stronger-than-expected results, growing 10%. The Americas shows a solid results with 8% growth. Looking at our performance by business unit. The Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenues of $1.03 billion, up 11% core. LSAG delivered growth across all end markets and regions. Our LC and LC/MS platforms continued their strong performance during the quarter, growing faster than the market at 16%. Demand in the chemicals and advanced materials end market continues to be strong. particularly for materials used in manufacturing semiconductors and batteries. Our Spectra business grew more than 20% in the quarter and we continue to strengthen our base in spectroscopy across multiple end markets. In Q1, we announced an appointment at the Insight200M. This system is used at checkpoints throughout the London Heathrow Airport to officially provide enhanced security and ensure passenger safety. The Asian Crosse group posted revenue of $381 million in Q1. This is up 13% core as the team continues to take advantage of record instrument placements over the past 2 years along with continued growth and attach rates. Across our team's deep knowledge of customer lab operations continues to drive consistently high levels of customer satisfaction. The breadth and diversity of our product offerings is driving record renewals for support contracts. At the same time, our Enterprise Services business continued its strong momentum, driving growth and converting competitive accounts. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenues of $342 million, up 5% core. Our pathology-related business performed well with double-digit growth led by the Americas and Europe. NASD posted another strong quarter, growing 22%. Our Train B manufacturing expansion remains on track to come online mid-calendar year. In January, we announced an additional $725 million expansion of our NASD facility that will double our oligo manufacturing capacity. And 2 weeks ago, we are pleased to have the Governor of Colorado join us in our groundbreaking ceremony at the Frederick site. In addition to organic investments, we continue to invest externally in new technologies and partnerships. In the quarter, we welcomed the Avida Biomed team into Agilent, further enhancing our genomics capabilities. Avida is early-stage life sciences company designed to assist clinical researchers using NGS approach in the study of cancer. We also continue to partner with new technology platform companies to drive our solutions in the marketplace. This quarter, we announced a partnership with the Akoya Biosciences to combine our companion diagnostic and IHC workload expertise with their solution to drive multiplex tissue assay development for biopharma. In addition to these business group highlights, Agilent was again recognized among the top 100 most just companies in the U.S. by Just Capital and CNBC. As part of this announcement, we are very proud to be the leader in the medical equipment and services industry for our treatment of employees and focus on customer relations. The Agilent team navigated challenging market uncertainties in Q1 and yet once again produced excellent results. It was a great start to the year. Q1 was another outstanding example of the work we've done to build a resilient company with multiple growth drivers. Those growth drivers create through targeted investments that aim to expand and enhance our business in high-growth areas are the heart of our Build and Buy growth strategy. As we look ahead to Q2, we remain confident in the strength and resilience of our business. We have an unstoppable One Agilent team that continues to execute at an extremely high level and is well prepared to deal with any challenges they face. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our full year core revenue and EPS guidance while also keeping a close eye on macroeconomic conditions. I will provide the detail on our overall outlook but overall, we remain convinced our strategic focus and unmatched execution capabilities will continue to drive strong results. Thank you for joining us today. And now, Bob, over to you. Yes. Thanks, Matt. First of all, I appreciate the recognition of the numbers we posted and we think there's still a lot more opportunity in front of us. And I want to actually have provide a little bit more color on where those opportunities may lie. Yes, I think we see a lot of opportunity, obviously, in China. That's when we flagged in the past. The other one that we're pointing to is a lot of the growth has historically been centered in the pharma space. We're seeing growing interest in the CAM space as well. So I think from an end market perspective, that's an area we would expect to see some more growth. And geographically, the China story still hasn't fully played out yet. And then again, I would just remind you, Matt, some of the points we made in the call, record renewals for support contracts and also clearly taking share on the enterprise level. Those attach rates we keep talking about are going up as well. So a lot to like here. Yes. So first of all, let me -- I'm taking a bit on this with Bob but let's -- I'll talk about the backlog, first of all, I think it's very important to just to remind the audience that the quality of our backlog remains extremely high. So -- and you can see the great work of our team at to work down the backlog but we're not seeing any cancellations or anything pulling out of backlog. So that gives us level of confidence around the revenues we can forecast. I think there really isn't anything new to talk about today relative to new news relative to the second half, we still remain -- we still want to acknowledge the uncertainty about the back half of the year. So really no new news here. It's very consistent to what we talked about in November. I think you're going to hear a lot of us talking about normalization of growth rates -- normalization of deal cycle times. So the funnels remain healthy. The deal cycle times are I think we've already more towards historical levels. And Bob, I don't know if you'd add anything to that? Well, I'm glad you noticed, Brandon and if you were in the conference room here, you see there's a lot of smiling in the room here because really proud of what the team has done here. So I don't think it's all a timing issue. It's about execution and its ability of this team to execute because our teams were hit with waves of COVID during the quarter. But we know how to execute. We've also enabled the -- our ability to interact with customers digitally. So while people maybe couldn't go to the office or couldn't go to customer sites, they were able to support the customers. So we were just -- we were just delighted with the performance out of China in Q3. And Bob, I think it was a broad-based story. We had growth and double-digit growth in pharma, chem, food. So it was really pleased with the results. I know our narrative is different than others are saying but I also think my team in China capability is also different. Yes. I want to tag team a bit with this with Sam and myself and Bob. So we evenly refer to Train B. That's the latest expansion that's coming online this year. In fact, we had a chance to see that firsthand when we went to the groundbreaking ceremony for what we call Project endeavor or as you're referring to [indiscernible]; it looks really good. We're on track for that mid-calendar year go live and we have a full book of business for that just a matter of ramp. And again, project up. And then I'm going to pass it over to Sam and maybe you want to remind, Brandon, what our plans are with the new expansion, when we expect to see some of that first revenue coming into Agilent. Sam, unless you're going to commit to me for earlier to go live. I think you meant to say '26, right? Yes. I'll pass this over to Bob for additional detail but I think the answer is no, not the unusual about movements between the quarters. And Bob, I think what we're going to do is we want to set up another guide in Q2 that was above our full year guide. So that was the process there. I have missed we're very prudent yet today, Bob? That is correct. Yes. I'll tag team on this. I'll lead and Sam, if you want to add some additional color. But first of all, the announcement from Novartis is no new news. We -- that has always been part of the plan and we actually have contractual agreements relative to how much of the on market demand we get. So that's all well known. But relative to the Novartis is one of the many customers we have in this business and we really have worked hard to build a diversified book of business. And we talk a lot about Novartis great customer. I talk a lot about Anylam because we're allowed to talk about those programs but we have a much broader base book of business. And I think that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward because we have a number of programs that we're supporting. We know not everyone is going to hit but we know that there's going to be a lot of success rates there as well. And Bob? Thanks, Bob. I appreciate that build. You want to take the first part of the question. And I think Puneet, you said it well. I mean, our business in China continues to be very, very strong and I couldn't be prouder of the team, how they delivered in Q1 and that's continuing strong momentum throughout the second half of last year and we would expect that to continue here in Q2 as well. Yes, I'll start and then we'll turn it over to Jacob to give some additional color about where we play and so forth. But I would say the short answer is no. I mean, our spectroscopy business grew over 20% in the quarter and we're still seeing strong demand. And Jacob, you want to provide a little more color? And Jack, I think the point you made earlier, too, about some of the funding environment, we're seeing some government funding coming in from different parts of the world as part of the semiconductor industry which has benefited us. Sure, Rachel, do I dare pass this question to the Danish member of the staff over that baseball analogy but I think, Jacob, got a great print on LC and LC/MS 17% growth, clearly outpacing the market. And I think we saw some really good strength in small molecule in particular this quarter. Yes. So I hope it came through in the call remarks and I'll make a few comments here, then invite organ here as well but we were delighted with the print in Europe in the first quarter exceeded our expectations. Actually, the strength across the marketplace was pretty good. I think 5 of our 6 end markets were growing high single digits or better. I think the standouts for us were actually the chem markets along with diagnostics. But I have to say we continue to watch closely the investment plans particularly for our large accounts in the chemical space as well as pharma space. But we're off to a really good start but that's -- that remains a watch area for us. But again, we're delighted with the broad-based growth we had. And I don't know if you... I think we don't talk about weather but I think the more favorable weather environment in Europe actually has put less pressure on customers relative to energy cost and energy demand. So that's been net positive but we're still keeping an eye on things. You want to take that, Bob? Yes. No, I think you're closing -- happy to comment on the day your closing comments exactly where our head is at which is the right fit. So we think the environment is much more favorable than it was a year ago. We think it's now much more of a buyer's market, so to speak. Most people are willing to come off at a view of last round. There's still some dialogue around there. So we're -- we have obviously nothing to announce but we remain very interested in looking for opportunities that can augment our core organic business and this is at the heart of our build and buy growth strategy. As I've said a number of times, the buy side is all optionality for us. We'll do just fine with all the bets we have right now. But if we see the right thing, we will move on it. And we just have also just wanted to make sure we stuck with our framework and we don't ever want to have buyers remorse. So we've been very happy with all the deals we've done to date and we'll continue to use that framework moving forward. I think that fit piece that you described is really a key criteria for us. Yes. Let me make some summary comments and then Bob, feel free to jump in here. But as you mentioned, we don't specifically provide book-to-bill ratios. But what I can tell you is that orders for the quarter were greater than revenue. So -- and so we continue to grow orders with particular strength in our ASD and the services business. On the instrument side, we continue to bring down this record backlog we had as we really are focused on meeting those customer shipment requirements and really thanks to the great work of the order fulfillment team, we've really been able to get back to a normal flow of shipment times and delivery commitments. Again, I would just say that the funnels remain healthy, the backlog is still a very high quality. I think we have pretty much next to no cancellations. So the quality is good. It gives Bob and I that level of predictability around revenue from that backlog. But I would emphasize one point I made earlier, the deal cycles are reverting towards the historic norms in this space. Again, this whole construct that we see of a normalization of particularly the analytical instrumentation marketplace evolving. Sure. Happy to talk about that. And I actually happen to have Jacob talk about it because I think you've just spent some time in front of the Board recently and talking about the PFAS opportunity. I don't want to educate the Board on what it's all about but the durability of growth we're seeing, we see here. Yes. Jack, I'm going to actually pass that over to Sam because Sam actually is calling in from Denmark. He's actually with the pathology team right now. So you can get it latest and greatest on the ground from Glostrup. Go ahead, Sam. Bob, I don't remember the exact number but it was down but not to that extent. Okay. And I'm going to have Sam talk about this but we're seeing some what we think is a transitory disruption in the diagnostics side of genomics that there's a lot going on with a lot of the diagnostic firms where we provide our solutions into their assays. So Sam, your perspective on the think would be really good. Yes. Bob, I'll let -- I think the headline is more just the recognition of the continued uncertainty about the back half but... Yes. Sure, Josh. In fact, Padraig, I think you've just done recently around with some of the large pharma accounts and... So I think we probably haven't seen any surprises on those like themselves but they're not aggressively releasing yet either. I think that's -- that's why I made a few times on this call comments around normalization of deal cycle times. It's hard to get all the good news in but I think we had a good start to the year at cell analysis, Jacob, as I recall? Yes. And I'll have you make some cost or part. But I think we're expecting the continued step-up in that attach rate. And as your question focused on the attach rate on services. But I'd be remiss not to have Jacob talked about what's going on in attach rate to consumers that ties in this workflow solutions because we did make some changes organizationally but the ACG strategy of driving connect rates and services and consumables remains intact. Paul, I'm really glad you hung on and got your question because very enthusiastic to answer that question. We have a much broader base of business beyond 2 very good customers but the programs go much, much, much broader than that. Yes. We crossed over on the siRNA piece. We are clearly the market leader. We are going to be going after more aggressively the CRISPR space where we can't yet claim leadership. But overall, we've really -- with the capacity expansion, the continued great work of our team. We continue to gain market share. And from the math we're doing, we've now crossed over in the leader in the space. I'm not sure I understand completely the question. But I think what we're doing is, I think I got it which is we're actually expanding our portfolio which is we're the leader in siRNA. We've got a broad base of business broad-based set of number of pharma customers. Over time, you hear more about those when their therapeutics come to market. but also we're expanding into the CRISPR area. We've got a small business there right now. We do really well. We just don't have all the capacity we need and that's part of the storyboard what we're doing, what we call Project Endeavor."

If you would like to withdraw your question, again, press star one. Thank you. Parmeet Ahuja, you may begin your conference.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, and welcome everyone to Agilent's conference call for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. I am sure you have seen our press release earlier today regarding our new market-focused organizational structure, which we will talk about in more detail. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. All financial metrics and guidance during this call will be shared under our historical structure. We will provide recast historical segment information to reflect these changes ahead of our upcoming investor day. Now onto our quarterly results. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO, and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Phil Binns, President of the former Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, Simon May, President of the newly formed Life Sciences and Diagnostic Markets Group, and Angelica Riemann, President of the expanded Agilent CrossLab Group. Also joining the call is Mike Zhang, President of the newly formed Applied Markets Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our fourth quarter financial results, investor presentation, and information to supplement today's discussion, along with the recording of this webcast, are available on our website at investors.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year, and references to revenue growth are on a core basis.

And now I would like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Great. Thank you, Parmeet. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I begin, I would like to welcome new AMG President, Mike Zhang. While Mike is new to this role, he is not new to Agilent. Mike joined Agilent more than twenty years ago as a manufacturing engineer in China and most recently was Vice President and General Manager of the GC and GCMS business. Within our former Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, with his broad experience in both manufacturing and into the business, Mike will be an incredible asset in this role. Very much looking forward to him moving AMG and Agilent forward. I also want to take a moment to wish Phil Binns a wonderful retirement in advance of him leaving Agilent. Phil joined Agilent with the Varian acquisition in 2010. All told, Phil is celebrating just over forty years of service with Agilent and Varian. Although Phil is retiring from the business president role, he has graciously agreed to serve as a special adviser through April 2025. All of us at Agilent wish Phil the very best and look forward to working with him during the last five months at Agilent. Now onto our high-level Q4 results. I am happy to share not only our solid fourth quarter results that point to continued steady market recovery, but also our outlook and drivers for the 2025 fiscal year. I am especially excited to talk about Agilent's customer-first strategy evolution and our aggressive transformation ambition that led to the news you read ahead of the call. The new market-focused organizational structure to become a nimbler, even more customer-centric company to accelerate our performance. In the fourth quarter, the Agilent team delivered revenue of $1.701 billion, roughly one percent reported growth with a flat core growth. This represents a sequential improvement of over four hundred basis points from Q3. In addition, our total company book-to-bill was greater than one. This points to a steady market improvement we are seeing and we expect it to continue in 2025. We also gained share in all our geographies. Evidence that even in challenging CapEx environment, customers trust Agilent. As we evolve, we are confident this will only accelerate. Bob will provide deeper details on our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1 and FY 2025. Now I would like to spend some time talking about our new organization structure we announced earlier today. Our new market-focused organization structure is a result of our customer-centric market force strategy and an important step in our organizational transformation work, which we have named Ignite. This is a product of our enterprise focus strategy that drives our evolution to become a nimbler, even more customer-centric company to accelerate our performance. The new market-focused organization structure is one of the most significant changes Agilent has seen in a decade and continues the work we did creating our commercial organization three years ago. The commercial organization doubled down on our customer-first approach in the field and it's a critical competitive advantage in supporting our customers. At that time, we started by creating a singular commercial leadership structure. We then created a foundational infrastructure and intensified our focus on digital capabilities, accelerated and end-to-end customer experience, and ensured sales channels were customer and market-centric. So changes you see today are part of the successful journey we started three years ago. With the new structure, we are aligning business units to our markets facilitating close collaboration among the businesses like never before and enabling better execution and cross-division customer-first priorities. We are combining the strength of our three businesses as well as our portfolios so that we can offer end-to-end solutions and workflows revolve around our customers and markets. The Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group's or LDG represents $2.5 billion in annual revenue and is primarily focused on our pharma, biopharma, and clinical diagnostic end markets. LDG provides a comprehensive portfolio of leading technology platforms and solutions to serve Agilent's customers' value chain, including research and discovery, development and scale-up, production of therapeutics, and development of critical cancer diagnostics. LDG includes LC and LCMS, cell analysis as well as CDMO capabilities which include NESD and BioVectra. The business also includes pathology, companion diagnostics, and genomics. Simon May will serve as president of LDG prior to joining Agilent earlier this year at Bio-Rad Laboratories. Simon was Executive Vice President and President of Life Science Group. The Applied Markets Group or AMG represents $1.3 billion in annual revenue and is focused on food, environmental, forensics, chemicals, and advanced materials markets. AMG includes GC and GCMS spectroscopy, vacuum technology platforms, and certified pre-owned business. AMG will focus on growing its agile and strong leadership in these markets and accelerating growth in new areas of the market. Mike Zhang, a twenty-two-year veteran of Agilent, has been promoted to president of AMG. Most recently, Mike was Vice President and General Manager of our GC and GCMS product lines. The Agilent CrossLab Group or ACG represents $2.7 billion in annual revenue and is focused on supporting our customers in all our end markets. The group is uniquely positioned to leverage its comprehensive portfolio and capabilities to further enhance the installed base of instruments with targeted workflows and applications that drive critical outcomes and productivity in labs. ACG includes services, software and informatics, automation, and consumables. This business will accelerate and strengthen customer relationships across all end markets. Angelica Riemann, a twenty-five-year veteran of Agilent, will continue to serve as president of ACG. Prior to her current role, she served as Vice President and General Manager of the ACG services business. This change is one of the many that demonstrate how we are becoming nimbler and accelerating the pace of innovation. And you can see that with the Q4 launch of the exciting Agilent Infinity 3 LC series that harnesses our fifty years of LC expertise and leadership. The Infinity 3 series has advanced automation that simplifies our customers' daily routines and is compatible with previous generation, which allows for seamless upgrades and technology refreshes. And Agilent Infinity Lab LC solutions are certified by MyGreenLab. These instruments optimize lab space, and they reduce water, solvent, and energy consumption while also minimizing waste. While just launched in October, early traction from customers has been very positive. Also in Q4, we closed our acquisition of BioVectra, demonstrating our commitment to providing customers the most advanced capabilities to accelerate our therapeutic programs. With BioVectra now being part of Agilent, we expand our portfolio of CDMO services beyond our market-leading oligonucleotide production at NASD. Adding more rapidly growing therapeutic modalities like peptide synthesis, a market expected to continue to expand rapidly over the coming years. And bringing world-class capability to support gene editing therapies. Just last month, my leadership team and I visited BioVectra to welcome our new team members to Agilent, and we became even more accelerated by the capabilities we would be able to harness. Plus both Agilent and BioVectra's focus on putting customer first and accelerating the pace of innovation so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities was abundantly clear as I spoke to dozens of BioVectra employees. Separately, during the quarter, we hit another important milestone. For the full year, we passed the $1 billion mark in digital orders, for the first time across the company. This is a result of our investment in our digital ecosystem to ensure our customers can do business with us in ways that meet their needs. To reinforce what I have stated in previous calls, we are sharply focused on key growth factors such as BioPharma, PFAS, and advanced materials. And the Agilent team has mobilized to accelerate value creation through our Ignite transformation program. The objective of Ignite is to drive revenue growth and margin expansion by increasing our execution capabilities.\nOperator: The world is moving faster than ever,\nPadraig McDonnell: and so are we. That is exactly why we introduced our new market-focused organization structure. We are laser-focused on winning in the marketplace and adding value to our customers and shareholders. We will dive more deeply into these details including our evolved strategy and the Ignite transformation, that will help us execute on that strategy. At our investor day on December seventeenth in New York.\nBob McMahon: We\nPadraig McDonnell: Bob would now provide the details of the results as well as our outlook for the fiscal year of 2025 and the first quarter. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Thank you, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on fourth quarter revenue and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I will then cover our guidance for fiscal year 2025 and the first quarter of 2025. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Padraig said, we are pleased with our Q4 results. Agilent finished the fourth quarter, with core growth in line with our expectations while EPS exceeded our expectations as we executed well against a challenging albeit improving market. Q4 revenue was $1.701 billion, a decline of 0.3% core but a sequential improvement of over four hundred basis points. On a reported basis, our revenues were up 0.8% as we benefited from fifty basis points of currency and BioVectra contributed sixty basis points. Looking at our Q4 performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $833 million in revenue. That represents a 1% decline as instrument volumes continue to be constrained, by conservative customer CapEx spending while consumables grew mid-single digits. Having said that, for our instruments business, our orders grew year on year and for the third consecutive quarter, our book-to-bill was once again greater than one. We see this as positive evidence of an ongoing steady instrument recovery. Moving on to Agilent CrossLab Group, the business delivered revenue of $426 million for the quarter, 5%. ACG grew in every market and in every region except China, where it was flat year over year but up sequentially. The contracts business including our fast-growing enterprise services business, double digits again in Q4 as it has every quarter this year. Our largest customers continue to maximize utilization of their assets, right-size their operations, and leverage OpEx budgets to deliver on their productivity goals and outcomes. We recently received a top supplier award from one of our largest strategic customers in the applied markets as a recognition of our long-standing and beneficial partnership throughout the years. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $442 million in revenue, representing a 3% decline that was slightly above expectations. Pathology saw solid growth globally, and was offset by expected softness in NESD and cell analysis instruments. Now looking at our end markets and geographies, our largest end market, pharma, declined 1%, slightly better than what we expected. Within pharma, biopharma declined mid-single digits while small molecule grew low single digits. Encouragingly, all regions except for the Americas, grew in the quarter. The Americas region was pressured by the expected decline of NASD. We expect both the Americas region and NASD to return to growth in fiscal year 2025. In chemicals and advanced materials, revenue grew 1% with our advanced materials submarket growing mid-single digits driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical end market performed strongly growing 7% driven by pathology, and improved performance in genomics.\nOperator: In environmental and forensics,\nBob McMahon: we declined 6% although dollars were roughly flat sequentially. All regions grew except for the US, related to timing of orders. That being said, we continue to see very strong growth in PFAS solutions. With our business growing more than 40% in Q4 across multiple end markets. Now wrapping up our end markets, food was down 3% versus last year. While our academia and government market was down 1%. Geographically, Asia ex-China high single digits and Europe grew low single digits in the quarter while the Americas and China declined as expected. China was down only 3% and exceeded our expectations. We also booked our first China stimulus orders in October and anticipate much more in fiscal year 2025. Now let's move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 55.1% in the quarter, down seventy basis points versus last year driven by lower volume and mix. Our operating margin was 27.4% as our productivity initiatives and the cost actions we took earlier in the year were fully recognized this quarter. The annualization of these savings coupled with the market recovery and the initial returns from the Ignite transformation, give us confidence in driving EPS growth in fiscal year 2025. In addition, we continue to look for ways to drive EPS growth below the line. Our net interest income was in line while we benefited from a lower tax rate in the quarter and our share count was 287 million diluted shares outstanding. Now putting it all together, Q4 earnings per share was $1.46, that was ahead of our expectations and up 6% from a year ago. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $481 million in the quarter, and we invested $93 million in capital expenditures. For the year, we well exceeded our operating cash flow expectations. With operating cash flow of $1.75 billion during the quarter, we returned over $400 million to shareholders, consisting of $335 million in share repurchases, and $68 million in dividends. For the year, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders, through repurchasing shares and dividends. Looking forward, you may have also seen recently we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend. Marking another year of increases advancing our industry-leading dividend. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.1, a very strong number even as we acquired BioVectra in the quarter. Our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet provide us with plenty of opportunity to invest in the business going forward. In summary, we performed well and saw steady market improvement in the quarter. We are executing well, staying disciplined, and investing in high-growth opportunities. Now let's move on to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. We expect the recovery that we have seen the past few quarters to continue throughout fiscal 2025. While we expect the market to grow slower than historical rates for the full year, we expect improvement throughout the year with the second half of the year returning to more traditional levels of growth. We expect our results to mirror that cadence of improvement on a core basis. As Padraig noted earlier, we exited Q4 with a book-to-bill ratio over one for the company, and greater than one for instruments. In addition, Q4 was the first quarter in 2024 that instrument orders grew year on year. While one quarter does not a trend make, it is certainly encouraging. For the full year guide, we expect revenue in the range of $6.79 to $6.87 billion. This represents a reported growth range of 4.3% to 5.5%. Currency is a slight headwind of 0.2 points while M&A related to BioVectra contributes 2% at the low end and 2.2% at the high end. This translates to a core growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. To start the year, we think this is a prudent way to plan given the near-term dynamics in the US. From a geographic perspective, we expect modest growth in the Americas and Europe. While we see funnel activity increasing in China, we are taking a conservative approach on the timing of revenue associated with the stimulus. We expect to see recovery over the course of the year in China, resulting in slightly positive growth for the full year. From a business group perspective, we expect to return to growth in all three groups led by ACG. As a note, this statement is true under the new structure as well. As Parmeet mentioned earlier, we will provide recast historical segment information to reflect these changes ahead of our upcoming investor day. In terms of phasing, we expect improvement throughout the year with more normalized growth expected in the second half of the year. We are projecting roughly fifty to seventy basis points of operating margin expansion for the year. Below the line, we expect net interest expense of $25 million due to the financing of BioVectra versus the net interest income this year. In addition, we expect a tax rate of 13% and 286 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.54 to $5.61 and incorporates the planned five cents year one dilution from BioVectra. This range represents a 5% to 6% growth rate if excluding the BioVectra dilution, a growth rate of 6% to 7% year on year. We expect cash flow to remain strong in fiscal year 2025. We are expecting roughly $1.65 billion in operating cash flow and $450 million in CapEx as 2025 is the peak spending year for the NASD expansion. Looking to Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion. Our forecast assumes no significant budget flush during the end of this calendar year. This represents a reported decline of 0.5% to growth of 1.3%. Currency is a thirty basis point headwind while M&A is expected to contribute 1.8 points of growth. We are expecting core growth between a decline of 2% to flat at the upper end. It's important to note that we estimate our projected Q1 year-over-year results will be negatively impacted this year by roughly two percentage points due to timing of the Lunar New Year which occurs in late January, versus February of last year. This includes the additional $15 million in revenue pull forward we communicated in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for the Lunar New Year impact, we are expecting continued sequential growth improvement. First quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28. Lower than the full year growth rate due to the Lunar New Year timing. Looking into 2025 and beyond, we remain incredibly optimistic about the future of our markets and our long-term prospects. We are confident in our new market-focused approach and the Ignite transformation will propel us to accelerated growth and we will become a stronger company. With that, I'll turn it back over to Padraig for some closing comments.\nPadraig McDonnell: I've said it before and I want to say it again. These are exciting times at Agilent. Over the last several months, we've been focused on evolving our strategy, transforming our processes, and empowering our people while continuing to win in the marketplace. Already we've made bold moves that have created momentum. We've developed our future strategy, we've kicked off our Ignite transformation to help execute on that strategy. And along the way, we've made moves to create new growth vectors. We are making acquisitions that will contribute to our growth and we are strengthening our capability to efficiently and effectively integrate those acquisitions that will lay the foundation for future M&A. These initial actions position us well for the journey ahead.\nBob McMahon: They ensure we are building the capability\nPadraig McDonnell: strength, and speed to reinvigorate our culture and enable us to thrive while delivering outstanding results for our customers and for our shareholders. And amid all this change, Fortune magazine this month named Agilent number eleven among the world's best workplaces 2024, a list that only includes twenty-five companies. This is yet another recognition of what we already know internally. The Agilent team is the best in the industry. This is not only a recognition of our outstanding company culture, of the talented professionals we have.\nBob McMahon: Ones who are ambitious,\nPadraig McDonnell: resilient, and high performing. This is exactly the team we need to evolve Agilent. To build an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers, and creates value for our shareholders. Thank you again for joining today's call. I couldn't be more energized by the momentum we have, the opportunities we will seize, and the history we will make. Now I look forward to answering your questions. Parmeet?\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Operator, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.\nOperator: And your first question today comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly from Citi. Your line is open.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Padraig, maybe one for you. Just on the instrument side, and I know you guys touched on the book-to-bill over one for three quarters now, a little bit of improved growth on the order side year over year. Can you talk about where we are in the cycle, what your expectations are? As you guys know, there's a debate in the market about what the cycle looks like. Does it overcorrect to the upside as we work our way through the next year or so? Are you guys framing that up? What's the right way to think about this replacement cycle, where we are, and the size of it as we go forward here?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Great question. So, you know, clearly, we're seeing a steady recovery in instruments and, you know, our book-to-bill was greater than one, which is really great to see. In terms of replacement cycle, what you would see across the industry is that it's not uniform. It's across different vendors at different speeds and, of course, at different times. But what we do see is that we have we're probably midway through the expected timing on where we expect that replacement cycle to be. We see competitors are probably benefiting from refresh of their own install base with some new systems. But what you would see from our side is our Infinity 3 that we announced last month. We expect to start seeing an increased demand for our solutions, and we're seeing a lot of excitement with our customer base. And we've already seen tens of millions of dollars in orders there. So what we expect in that replacement cycle is to be slow and steady, but really kicking off in Q1.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. And that's helpful. And then maybe on China, you know, always a focus with you guys. It sounds like slight growth for 2025 is the right way to think about it. Can you just talk about what you guys are seeing there and hearing there? You know, Bob, helpful to hear that you guys got your first orders there in October. What's the expectation as we move forward here? It sounds like a steady recovery. Are you still seeing I know you guys were kinda hovering around that $300 million revenue a quarter stability. It sounds like continued and maybe a little bit of improvements as we work our way through the year. Are there different segments that are maybe picking up a little bit? Would be helpful to talk through. Thank you, guys.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. So performance was a bit better than expected, and it was also really encouraging to see lab activity to continue to improve across our services and consumables. So we actually have seen quite dramatic share gains within China, which is also a really good point. So what I would say is it's steadily improving. You know, talking to the teams. And I would say on the stimulus side, you know, we talked in the call about we've already have some stimulus orders in. We expect much more in Q1. That will, of course, translate to revenue. And this is a really, really good sign as we see momentum both from the direct input of more confidence in the market and, of course, getting the dollars in. So steadily improving, and we expect that through the year, Patrick. We expect as we go through the stimulus orders and we go forward, expect that to improve. One area that was really standout for us was PFAS in China. It was the fastest-growing business for us across the globe or region across the globe, and that just goes to show the durable nature of some of these growth factors that are happening where you have the emergent pollutants act moving. And what we've seen in China is that our great technical expertise coupled with our great solutions are already there to pick up the business. So that was one real clear standout.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Patrick. Just want to add on to what Padraig is saying. Yeah. You're absolutely right. We ended the quarter with roughly $310 million, $312 to be precise, in China. Which was a nice sequential increase from Q3 and, you know, it was down 3% as I mentioned. In addition to the PFAS, both chemical and advanced materials actually grew in the quarter. We're, you know, we have a leadership position and pharma was flat, which was actually a very nice thing. And we're taking a kind of a conservative approach, as I mentioned, in terms of the stimulus orders, but we've seen quite active funnel from the standpoint of bidding activity here in the first half of this quarter as well as and expect that to continue throughout the course of 2025.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Bob and Padraig. I appreciate it.\nPadraig McDonnell: Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Matt Sykes from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one just on DGG, which has been sort of weighing on growth over the course of the year, but noticeably strong quarter. You had called out CancerDx as well as genomics. Could you just provide a little bit more color on what's driving that growth? And how sustainable do you think that growth is, particularly in genomics as we move through 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. I just said start off, and I'll kick it over to Simon. You know, as we really are seeing nice growth in our pathology business, which grew high single digits in Q4 and is slightly ahead of expectations. A highly durable business in any markets. What we're seeing in genomics, while it's a still challenging market, we posted low single-digit growth, which was also ahead of expectations. But, Simon, I don't know if you want to add some color.\nSimon May: Yeah. Just a quick couple of quick points to add. As Padraig mentioned, we were pretty pleased with the high single-digit growth that we saw in pathology in the quarter. And in particular, the blend and the mix between instruments and consumables there, we continue to be really healthy. With our instrument placements, and we think that sees us quite nicely going into 2025. On the genomic side, it was really notable because it's the first time that we've seen growth in genomics for quite a while now. I'd say we've had a bit of a pivot in our strategy there to really double down on the growth drivers that we see in genomics, where we've got clearly differentiated value propositions and in particular, our Magnus automated NGS library prep continues to see fantastic traction. We're also very encouraged by the pipeline that we're seeing for our Aveda NGS chemistry. And, again, this gives us a lot of hope going into FY 2025. And as I think about pathology and genomics and these growth factors that we see here, we do believe that they're durable given the macro conditions and the competitive position that we enjoy.\nMatt Sykes: Great. Thanks. And maybe just for my follow-up, a high-level question for you, Padraig. On the resegmentation, it makes sense from a go-to-market strategy for some of these segments to put them together. I'm wondering from an R&D development and new product innovation, how this might help. I mean, you referenced the LC replacement cycle accelerating faster for competitors as they refresh their installed base. Should we start to see a faster cycle of new product introductions due to the resegmentation, or is it gonna be similar to the pace that we've seen in the past and resegmentation really doesn't necessarily inform R&D direction?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Well, look, I think we're refocusing the groups really for a few reasons. We want to be closer to customers, but also understanding where do we want to make our biggest investment or most asymmetric that are going to accelerate innovation in key areas. And when I talk about focus, it's really three things. You know, it's the energy to time, but also the capital allocation. And what you will see from this refocusing of our segments, we're gonna be able to do that. You're gonna see programs accelerate. But also, we don't want to be two inches deep across the company. We want to be focused on our key growth factors and making sure we accelerate. We have a huge amount of product lines and, of course, we can have incremental additions to product lines across the board. But from this new structure, you're gonna see an acceleration of R&D. No doubt about it.\nMatt Sykes: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rachael Raycroft with Your line is open.\nRachael Raycroft: Perfect. Thank you for taking the questions, you guys, and good afternoon. So I wanted to follow-up on Patrick's question on China. Appreciate that it's early days, but how are you guys thinking about the risk of potential tariffs on Agilent's business at this point in China and in the rest of the world? Is there anything embedded in guidance currently from a tariff standpoint? And then can you remind us what was the tariff impact on Agilent in the first Trump administration?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Rachael. This is Bob. I'll take that question. As you can imagine, there's been a fair amount of work that we've been doing on this exact question. What I would take it if I took it into two chunks, actually, we've been working on diversifying our supply chain particularly within China, you know, China, back in eighteen, nineteen when the first tariffs came and then, obviously, double down on that resiliency with COVID. And so it is ten to fifteen million dollars existing today. And we think that the future potential magnitude of this is certainly manageable with us with additional mitigation activities. Obviously, with something that would be more broad-based than that, it would be more material. But to just give you a frame of reference, roughly two-thirds of our business in the US comes from product that's sourced in the US.\nRachael Raycroft: Great. That's helpful. And then just for my follow-up, you mentioned that chemical and advanced materials grew 1% this quarter. Was wondering, could you just break down some of the trends that you saw within? You mentioned that semiconductors drove some of the performance that you saw on the advanced materials side. We actually had one of your peers call out some weakness in semi this quarter. So just talk to us about what you're seeing from an underlying perspective on that side. And then again, just tell me business as well. Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. So in the chemical advance materials, we grew 1% and we sold 4% of materials, and that's driven, you know, a lot by our battery business that we have and, of course, semiconductor. We saw a slight decline in chemical and energy. But overall, we're very happy with the growth that we've seen in Asia ex-China, by the way, was driven and also low single digits in China. So the one thing that I would note about this industry is that we've got the broadest platform and solutions around it. And it's the CAM is returning to positive year on year growth for the first time since Q2 in 2023, so that really bodes well for the future.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Rachael. And maybe just for the benefit of you and the rest of the folks on the call, I talked about guidance. If you look at it by end market, just to kinda give everyone a frame, you know, for the full year FY 2025, we're expecting pharma to return to growth. So low to mid-single-digit growth there. Academia government roughly flat. Actually, expect the diagnosis and clinical that Simon just talked about to continue and be the highest growth end market, at least to start off the year here in FY 2025 at mid-single digits. CAM also low to mid, given the work and the discussion that Padraig just gave. And then food and environmental, both low single digits with pockets of very strong growth. And really, you know, food, there was a potential where the actually could accelerate throughout the course of the year given some of the potential changes in the administration coming up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe building off of the last question here on the drivers of fiscal 2025. When you look at the first half versus second half, it does assume a back half step up. We're just curious. Is that being driven by end markets normalizing? Maybe if you could just walk us through from first half versus back half dynamics in fiscal 2025?\nBob McMahon: Yeah, Vijay. That's exactly right. So, you know, obviously, our first quarter is what I would call artificially depressed just because of the way of the nature of our timing of our fiscal year relative to Lunar New Year. But if you looked at first half versus second half, we're expecting this continued recovery throughout the course of the year. And with a more normalized growth in the back half of the year. And so where does that show up? It shows up in a couple of areas. Obviously, with the potential for China getting better throughout the course of the year. As Padraig mentioned, certainly, stimulus can help that. We've taken a conservative approach on that and not fully baked in with all the activity that we talked about. We'll see how that plays out, but certainly early days are very positive from that standpoint. And then also from a pharma perspective, we're also expecting to see that recovery particularly on the back of Infinity 3 as Padraig just mentioned, and that replacement cycle accelerating. So you're actually seeing those that would be the two biggest and then, you know, continued biotech recovery on the small biotech side as well throughout the course of next year.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then one on that maybe margins, we cash. Pretty impressive free cash execution in fiscal 2024. Just wanna make sure I have the numbers right. Is the guide assuming free cash flow down above it, there's a timing element and on the margin sort of similar cadence question, what is Q1 assuming and what drives the back half step up in margins? Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. So Q1, so let me answer your question around free cash flow. Yeah. We are expecting a slight slip down really a result of a step up in CapEx spending this year versus last year. As we, you know, finished the heavy levels of spending for the NASD expansion for Trane CND. I don't expect that to continue into 2026 and 2027, so you would see that then step back down. So that free cash flow is really a timing issue. In terms of Q1, profitability with the lower revenue, we typically have higher expenses in Q1 as some of the merit resets. We've got our sales meetings and kickoffs meetings there, and then you've got, you know, some January typically is a very light month, but we have a full amount of expenses in there. And then you then also look at the Ignite transformation that Padraig talked about, many of those activities that we've been kicking off will come into play in the second half of the year, which will generate incremental savings both on the top line and the bottom line. And what you'll hear more about that, some of those details at the Investor Day in mid-December.\nVijay Kumar: And so thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Nephron Research. Your line is open.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just walk us through for the 2025 guide what this assumes for each of the segments. Not sure if you can provide it under the old method or just the new method, but any color would be great.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. I could do that. So if you think about this at, I'll call it legacy number. So LSAG kinda low single digits with the consumables business being kind of mid-single-digit and slower on the instrument throughout the course of the year. That's probably our area where we've taken a prudent approach as we go through the course of the year. It could be more than that, depending on the uptake of the replacement cycle INFINITY 3, but low single digits there. ACG continued to be very strong with mid to high single digits as the instrumentation recovery and then continued double-digit on the services business. Just continues to be a real stalwart of growth, and we still have a lot of opportunity there around rate. And then for DGG, kind of low to mid-single-digit growth. Going forward, which is a recovery, you know, the continued performance of pathology in the genomics businesses, as Simon mentioned, and then a return to growth really for NESD.\nJack Meehan: Right. Okay. And then wondering if you could just talk a little bit more just what your expectations are for LC, LCMS. I think everybody's trying to benchmark expectations for next year and one of your peers sounds a little bit more bullish as it pertains to the cycle. So I don't know if you have any thoughts as we try and compare and contrast some of these results. Any color would be great. And maybe just off of that, any comments you can share around GLP one contribution I think that might be a factor, but any color would be great. Thank you.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. So, you know, there's a lot of dynamism in terms of replacement cycle. You know, it doesn't happen at any time, as I said before, any one time, but it's across the board in different industries and different times. From our perspective, you know, our LC and LCMS orders are improving. There's no doubt about that. And we have a huge amount of excitement around our Infinity 3. We have a lot of focus programs with our customers around that. So what you will see next year is I think it's a steady increase in cadence of that replacement cycle. You know, it's a little bit too early to call. Will that be gradual over a number of quarters or a bolus in one quarter or maybe then a slowdown and again on the next quarter? But we're really watching that as we go forward. I think we're being very conservative around what we're seeing on that because of a lot of turbulences everybody has seen in the last few years in the market. But I would say customer sentiment is steadily improving. And on the GLP One side, you know, we had a really fantastic year. We grew 30% in GLP one this year. We're involved in a lot of new site build-outs in QAQC departments and actual getting closer to production as well with systems. So a very, very strong year. And actually one thing that's really interesting is through the acquisition of BioVectra, we, of course, have a healthy pipeline of GLP-one and synthetic peptides within their CDMO capability. We're seeing a lot of requests from both sides of the business about how we can help customers both on the analytical side and on the CDMO side. So we're seeing a huge amount of synergies there. So this is a market that's going to continue very strongly and we're going to be really there to take the business.\nBob McMahon: Hey, Jack. Just to build on what Padraig is saying on the LC replacement cycle, I think one of the things is, you know, we're taking a more conservative approach as Padraig mentioned. And I think if that happens, we will get that business rest assured. I would also say, if we look at the age of our installed base, it is continuing to get old. It is well beyond the median now. And throughout the course of next year. So we would expect that to continue to be able to be replaced. Because when we look at the instrumentation through our consumables business and our services business, the activity continues to be high. So these instruments are being used, and so it's only a matter of time to be able to do that replacement.\nJack Meehan: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from UBS. Hi. Thank you. Just to clarify on instruments one last time, is your expectation that instrument growth is flat in 2025?\nBob McMahon: In aggregate across all platforms, our expectation is that it will grow. Low single digits.\nDan Leonard: Okay. And then my follow-up. You mentioned, I think, something about the administration and changes in your food forecast. Are there any other areas where you think the change in US administration could impact your business? Any other areas that you were sensitive to putting together your forecast for 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Look, there's a lot of changes that can happen at this time. You know, there's a lot of people expecting a lot of change. We have yet to see what those changes will be. Of course, you can see maybe some changes in the NIH funding, which is very low for us as a percentage of the business. We actually expect the PFAS spending will actually increase as it goes forward on it. The area to watch, I would say, is, of course, tariffs, which Bob talked about. We're ready for that. Ready for any scenario on that side. But also on biopharma, I think, is the IRA is also continues to move forward, the International Pricing Index seeing what happens on biopharma is gonna be really important. So that's why we're taking a kind of conservative and prudent approach. So lots going on. But what I would say is from the strategy work, I would imagine, we're ready for all outcomes.\nDan Leonard: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\nPuneet Souda: Yeah. Hi, Padraig, Bob, thanks for taking my questions. First one, just wanted to clarify on the tariff side. I mean, if there were any retaliatory tariffs could you elaborate on your manufacturing and final assembly positions just globally so we can understand sort of how much of the product is sort of China for China, made in China versus made in other Asian countries and not coming from the US.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Maybe I can start off by talking about our, you know, our US supply chain in there. About 60%, as Bob said, is produced in the United States. About 35% is the rest of the world. So it's actually a small percentage that's produced in China. But, of course, we have mitigations and steps there. We have many supply chain areas across the globe that we can move around, and we've done that before since 2018. We expect the impact probably in the quarter of $4 million to $5 million we can probably mitigate that within a few months. So I would say we're waiting to see how that all plays out. But we're already taking steps across potential tariffs. The big question for everybody is that will it be on will it be beyond China? I think everybody's waiting to see what that is, but even in that case, we're ready with mitigations.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Puneet. To build on what Padraig is saying, particularly for retaliatory tariffs in China, very little of our revenue now is produced in the US that goes into China. We spent a lot of time and effort building in China for China, and we have a full portfolio of capabilities there. Which is actually really important for us to be able to take full advantage of the stimulus products today. So, and, you know, I think that number will be relatively small. From the standpoint of retaliatory impact from China exports from the US.\nPuneet Souda: That's helpful. Thanks. And then, I have a question on Infinity 3 series. Just wondering, given the launch timing, was there any pause that you saw in on the instrumentation? And what is the order book telling you? Do you think this is what's driving, you know, is it a major driver of instrumentation orders in the quarter being positive as you pointed out?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. You know, we had a minimal effect to be honest. We really planned around that and of course, we are very careful with our customers to make sure we bring them through the cycle of replacement. So minimal impact. You know, we're very extremely excited about it. You know, it's a system that not only will be best in class in terms of performance, but also in terms of productivity. And that's what we're hearing loud and clear from our customers. It's about productivity and how it lends their labs to be more productive going forward. We're extremely pleased with the order book that we've seen so far. And we expect that that will continue to ramp and, you know, customers are really voting with their orders on that. So we're excited about that ramp for next year.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Thank you. Look forward to the investor day.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, thanks. Wanted to probe in a little bit. Are you able to delineate what LC did and what mass spec did in the quarter? And then just thinking a little bit about the new administration, I know you're not guiding for any budget flush here, but is there any risk of kind of pause in spending given all the moving pieces around pharma? What are you hearing from customers at this point?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Maybe I can start with the second part, Tycho. We're not seeing a pause from pharma validating. We're actually seeing a little bit more activity. So we're not seeing that across the board, and that's about the US and globally. And, of course, that's something we really want to watch with the new administration coming in. And what transpires over the next few weeks. But in terms of the LC and LCMS, Bob, I don't know if you got any color on those.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Tycho. Just to give you a couple of different pieces of data. If I look at our pharma business overall, it was down low single digits. Pharma, small molecule was actually up 3% overall with biotech or biopharma being down. If we look at specifically LC, LCMS, within pharma, it was up low single digits.\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up on NASD, I know I think you're talking back to growth in 2025. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about your ability to cross-sell with BioVectra and then how are you thinking about clinical versus commercial customers?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. I'll start off, Tycho, and I'll hand it over to Simon. You know, first of all, we are extremely pleased on the cross-selling ability between the two businesses. It was one of the key sources of value about why we did the BioVectra acquisition that customers were asking us for this capability, a broader range of capability, and we've seen that actually accelerate from both sides. Simon, I don't know if you want to add more color on NESD.\nSimon May: Yeah. Just to build on what Padraig said with BioVectra and the NASD cross-pollination, there's been really strong engagement between the teams. In fact, they spent several days together in our Boulder facility last week, and I'd say they came away really energized that the portfolio complementarity fit between businesses is exactly as we expected. In fact, maybe a little bit more so. Then as we think about NASD going into FY 2025, I think as Bob mentioned earlier, we're projecting high single-digit growth for the business. The order book looks really strong in NASD, but it's important to understand the nuances of the mix in that order book. We've got a number of commercialization qualifications going on right now. So in terms of FY 2025 revenue, there's a lot of energy going into that with relatively limited revenue upside, and a lot of that's gonna actually hit towards FY 2026. But, again, the order book overall is very healthy. And as we think about twelve, eighteen, twenty-four months view, we're really bullish about what we're seeing. But once again, high single-digit growth, maybe we'll nudge double-digit in NASD in FY 2025?\nTycho Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBrandon Couillard: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Just on the Infinity 3 launch, can you remind us, you know, when the Infinity 2 I think it's the 1290 system rolled out. And what's the is there an ASP premium? Is there an ASP kicker to this replacement cycle this time as well to the three versus the legacy two system. Thanks.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. We don't talk about a difference in pricing on it, you know, but I think we've had a number of years, of course, very, very successful years with the Infinity 2 and this builds on success. I will say that the installed base for Agilent is way broader than the Infinity 2. You know, we have 1100s that are very, very prominent out there. We have a lot of labs with 1100s and those are the labs for us, I think, that are gonna be talking about replacement. But we also have seen significant interest from Infinity 2 customers because the CDXTR productivity capability is really going to help them in the lab. So I would say it's not just, you know, one series to the next. It's a broad install base replenishment we're gonna see.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. All I would say is pricing has held up very nicely. Early days.\nBrandon Couillard: Okay. And then Bob, how much of the CapEx is in Nexter is tied to the train B and build out for NASD, we expect those to come online, and what does maintenance CapEx look like? In fiscal 2026? Thanks.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. That's a great question. So roughly half is NASD between the continued build-out and the validation activities of that $450 million. If I look at, kinda maintenance CapEx, think about it in, you know, kinda two and a half to three times sales. Range on a go-forward basis.\nBrandon Couillard: That's total cover. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nDoug Schenkel: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just want to start first with a question on guidance philosophy. Just to be clear, it sounds like you're trying to factor in a degree of conservatism on China stimulus, the impact of uncertainty as it relates to the new administration, and conservatism on a potential LC replacement cycle. Hopefully, I'm not missing anything there. But is it fair to say that the error bar around your assumptions are wider than normal heading into a new fiscal year and your intent across the board was to make assumptions that were consistently on the lower end of those error bars?\nPadraig McDonnell: I think you said it well. You know, we were very conservative in that because of those reasons, you know, what is the expected LC replacement cycle recovery? Is it faster? Is it, you know, is it a little bit less than that? The China stimulus, you know, which is very early days, you know, I think we want to make sure that we continue to monitor that. And, of course, whether we see improved conditions or not in terms of sentiment in the US. So all of these things are factoring into this. So it is conservative in what we're guiding, but also I'd say here, the bars are wider than normal.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Thank you for that. And just as always, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe in your prepared remarks, you indicated that small molecule was up low single digits while biopharma was down mid-singles. If I have that right, is that comp effect, or are you seeing more of a recovery in demand amongst, you know, small versus large molecule applications, and I guess, finally, if so, why? That seems to be a little contradicting just curious if you could give us a little more there.\nBob McMahon: Yeah, Doug. You know, you heard it right. Our small molecule business was up low single digits across both instruments. You know, it was the combination of instruments and services. And our biotech, our large molecule was down mid-singles. Now if you took out NASD, which shows up in the large molecule, it was down low single digits. So better recovery than the mid-single digits. And it actually speaks to, I think, that continuation of volume in small molecule. You know, if you look at pill count, it continues to go up. And these are, you know, well-capitalized companies. They have probably the older fleet you just think about kind of the replacement versus kind of the biotechs of the world, and so we're expecting that to continue and, it was the first to kind of go down. And so we're, you know, in the cycle, and I think we're expecting it to be the first, you know, moving positive. Now we think there's more upside in biotech than there is in small molecule, but it certainly is a nice leading indicator around the idea around this replacement cycle.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin from Bank of America. Line is open.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thanks for taking the question, guys. First, I want to ask a quick follow-up on China stimulus. I know you kinda touched on them in a couple of different questions. But early in the prepared remarks, you did make some comments of, you know, seeing some initial China stimulus orders come in. I think China in the quarter exceeded your expectations. I know there's not a lot embedded directly into the guide. But could you just walk us through sort of, like, how China's stimulus could play out next year? And I'm asking this from a perspective of, you know, gradual ramp as you go through the year. Is it gonna be a trickle? Is it could it be very back-end loaded? It's just trying to think through the various scenarios and what you're looking for there. Once the initial order is clear.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. Look. I think what we've seen is that it's much broader. The stimulus in terms of range. We spoke about that before. We see it, you know, both on commercial and government accounts. Our first orders have actually come in from government accounts. We've been highly successful in those overall tenders, and we're in the low millions range, low single-digit millions range of orders to bring. We're expecting to close much more this quarter. And one thing that's really playing into our favor is our broad platform capabilities. Including the technical capabilities of our teams up and running. And you couple that with our Made in China initiatives that we really invested over the last year, it puts us in a very, very strong position to capitalize, but it'll be interesting to see how that's launched. Past the first quarter, we don't have great visibility yet, but, of course, a lot of deal activity. But the first quarter is looking very strong in terms of orders.\nBob McMahon: Yeah. Hey, Mike. And just to kind of frame it, kind of how we're thinking about China to your point. If we took Q4 and just divide it by or multiply it by four, that would get you to that low single-digit growth. Now we're expecting a recovery throughout the course of the year, but that kind of gives you a sense for what we put in the initial guide and we'll know a lot more about those timing of the stimulus revenues going forward. You know, once we actually get those awarded and then the delivery dates and so forth. But we do think that that'll occur throughout the course of the year.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Bob, maybe for you, just on the margin guide for next year, fifty to seventy bps. So really impressive starting point honestly better than I think a lot expected. Especially given, you know, still a little bit of a subdued top-line environment. How much of that can you attribute to Ignite and sort of, you know, maybe some of the transformation or one-time cost savings, how much is just the underlying strength of the business, maybe beside the price or some mix shift next year? Just a little bit of what's going into that margin expansion for next year?\nBob McMahon: Yeah. What I would say, Mike, is it's a little of all those things. So maybe stay tuned, and we'll give you a little more meat on the bones here come mid-December. But we certainly have some incremental opportunities both in price and, you know, cost efficiencies associated with the Ignite transformation. And those things will start to feather into the second half of this year, as I mentioned before. If you recall, the first half of this year also has the annualization of the savings of the actions that we had to take in the June, July time frame as well. So we're benefiting and then you also have the merit increases and so forth that gets reset. And so you'll actually see this throughout the course of the year through a series of initiatives that have already been kicked off.\nPadraig McDonnell: And I would say just following up on that, Bob, we're very excited to meet everybody in December in New York to talk about it. It's an extremely well-thought-out program. It's across the board. It's ultimately gonna help us to invest for growth in key areas as well as margin expansion.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Dan Brennan from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe the first one just on pharma. In the Americas. I think you called that in the prepared remarks Americas Pharma XMASD was kind of maybe a weaker spot. You just unpack a little bit what's happening in, you know, US versus, say, Europe, rest of the world and kind of, you know, what's kind of assumed from what happened in 4Q in 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yeah. I mean, look, we saw a lot of strength in Europe in terms of pharma. I wouldn't read too much into the American numbers. You know, I think there is, of course, companies wondering about their CapEx budgets and that comes at different phases. But we expect, we expect Pharma to continue.\nDan Brennan: Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on if I can just go into the broader market. I know you talked about the period in Mark's, Bob, and a few times it came up like you're expecting a below-trend market. At least it sounds like for the first half of the year, can you just remind us in terms of your kind of growth algorithm maybe, like, what would what is your assumptions based upon for a market growth typically? Kinda what are you assuming? And kind of specifically, is it just pharma that's weaker? Or are there other spots that you're pointing to that are below trend? And, you know, any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yeah, Dan, if we looked at the long-term growth rates of our markets, we believe those are mid-single digits, you know, four to when you look at the aggregate across. We're obviously not expecting that for the full year here. We are expecting that we're doing better than the market. If you look at kinda how we exited here roughly flat on a core basis, you know, if you adjust for the timing of Lunar New Year, you know, you had the midpoint one percent, you know, and expect that kind of performance to continue that cadence. And so you would have the second half of the year a more normalized kind of growth rates. And so it's really across the board. We're seeing, you know, some of the industrial or applied markets things like CAM being a little ahead of the curve and certainly our diagnostics and clinical business continues to be strong. It has been throughout the course of this year. Exiting at a very healthy rate, and I would expect that to continue. The big ones are pharma coming in and then, you know, some of the other applied markets as well.\nOperator: And this concludes the question and answer session. Mr. Ahuja, I turn the call back over to you.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Rob, and thanks everyone for joining the call today. Before we sign off, I'd like to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving. Have a good rest of the day and week everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Padraig McDonnell",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Parmeet. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. Before I begin, I would like to welcome new AMG President, Mike Zhang. While Mike is new to this role, he is not new to Agilent. Mike joined Agilent more than twenty years ago as a manufacturing engineer in China and most recently was Vice President and General Manager of the GC and GCMS business. Within our former Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group, with his broad experience in both manufacturing and into the business, Mike will be an incredible asset in this role. Very much looking forward to him moving AMG and Agilent forward. I also want to take a moment to wish Phil Binns a wonderful retirement in advance of him leaving Agilent. Phil joined Agilent with the Varian acquisition in 2010. All told, Phil is celebrating just over forty years of service with Agilent and Varian. Although Phil is retiring from the business president role, he has graciously agreed to serve as a special adviser through April 2025. All of us at Agilent wish Phil the very best and look forward to working with him during the last five months at Agilent. Now onto our high-level Q4 results. I am happy to share not only our solid fourth quarter results that point to continued steady market recovery, but also our outlook and drivers for the 2025 fiscal year. I am especially excited to talk about Agilent's customer-first strategy evolution and our aggressive transformation ambition that led to the news you read ahead of the call. The new market-focused organizational structure to become a nimbler, even more customer-centric company to accelerate our performance. In the fourth quarter, the Agilent team delivered revenue of $1.701 billion, roughly one percent reported growth with a flat core growth. This represents a sequential improvement of over four hundred basis points from Q3. In addition, our total company book-to-bill was greater than one. This points to a steady market improvement we are seeing and we expect it to continue in 2025. We also gained share in all our geographies. Evidence that even in challenging CapEx environment, customers trust Agilent. As we evolve, we are confident this will only accelerate. Bob will provide deeper details on our Q4 results and our outlook for Q1 and FY 2025. Now I would like to spend some time talking about our new organization structure we announced earlier today. Our new market-focused organization structure is a result of our customer-centric market force strategy and an important step in our organizational transformation work, which we have named Ignite. This is a product of our enterprise focus strategy that drives our evolution to become a nimbler, even more customer-centric company to accelerate our performance. The new market-focused organization structure is one of the most significant changes Agilent has seen in a decade and continues the work we did creating our commercial organization three years ago. The commercial organization doubled down on our customer-first approach in the field and it's a critical competitive advantage in supporting our customers. At that time, we started by creating a singular commercial leadership structure. We then created a foundational infrastructure and intensified our focus on digital capabilities, accelerated and end-to-end customer experience, and ensured sales channels were customer and market-centric. So changes you see today are part of the successful journey we started three years ago. With the new structure, we are aligning business units to our markets facilitating close collaboration among the businesses like never before and enabling better execution and cross-division customer-first priorities. We are combining the strength of our three businesses as well as our portfolios so that we can offer end-to-end solutions and workflows revolve around our customers and markets. The Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets Group's or LDG represents $2.5 billion in annual revenue and is primarily focused on our pharma, biopharma, and clinical diagnostic end markets. LDG provides a comprehensive portfolio of leading technology platforms and solutions to serve Agilent's customers' value chain, including research and discovery, development and scale-up, production of therapeutics, and development of critical cancer diagnostics. LDG includes LC and LCMS, cell analysis as well as CDMO capabilities which include NESD and BioVectra. The business also includes pathology, companion diagnostics, and genomics. Simon May will serve as president of LDG prior to joining Agilent earlier this year at Bio-Rad Laboratories. Simon was Executive Vice President and President of Life Science Group. The Applied Markets Group or AMG represents $1.3 billion in annual revenue and is focused on food, environmental, forensics, chemicals, and advanced materials markets. AMG includes GC and GCMS spectroscopy, vacuum technology platforms, and certified pre-owned business. AMG will focus on growing its agile and strong leadership in these markets and accelerating growth in new areas of the market. Mike Zhang, a twenty-two-year veteran of Agilent, has been promoted to president of AMG. Most recently, Mike was Vice President and General Manager of our GC and GCMS product lines. The Agilent CrossLab Group or ACG represents $2.7 billion in annual revenue and is focused on supporting our customers in all our end markets. The group is uniquely positioned to leverage its comprehensive portfolio and capabilities to further enhance the installed base of instruments with targeted workflows and applications that drive critical outcomes and productivity in labs. ACG includes services, software and informatics, automation, and consumables. This business will accelerate and strengthen customer relationships across all end markets. Angelica Riemann, a twenty-five-year veteran of Agilent, will continue to serve as president of ACG. Prior to her current role, she served as Vice President and General Manager of the ACG services business. This change is one of the many that demonstrate how we are becoming nimbler and accelerating the pace of innovation. And you can see that with the Q4 launch of the exciting Agilent Infinity 3 LC series that harnesses our fifty years of LC expertise and leadership. The Infinity 3 series has advanced automation that simplifies our customers' daily routines and is compatible with previous generation, which allows for seamless upgrades and technology refreshes. And Agilent Infinity Lab LC solutions are certified by MyGreenLab. These instruments optimize lab space, and they reduce water, solvent, and energy consumption while also minimizing waste. While just launched in October, early traction from customers has been very positive. Also in Q4, we closed our acquisition of BioVectra, demonstrating our commitment to providing customers the most advanced capabilities to accelerate our therapeutic programs. With BioVectra now being part of Agilent, we expand our portfolio of CDMO services beyond our market-leading oligonucleotide production at NASD. Adding more rapidly growing therapeutic modalities like peptide synthesis, a market expected to continue to expand rapidly over the coming years. And bringing world-class capability to support gene editing therapies. Just last month, my leadership team and I visited BioVectra to welcome our new team members to Agilent, and we became even more accelerated by the capabilities we would be able to harness. Plus both Agilent and BioVectra's focus on putting customer first and accelerating the pace of innovation so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities was abundantly clear as I spoke to dozens of BioVectra employees. Separately, during the quarter, we hit another important milestone. For the full year, we passed the $1 billion mark in digital orders, for the first time across the company. This is a result of our investment in our digital ecosystem to ensure our customers can do business with us in ways that meet their needs. To reinforce what I have stated in previous calls, we are sharply focused on key growth factors such as BioPharma, PFAS, and advanced materials. And the Agilent team has mobilized to accelerate value creation through our Ignite transformation program. The objective of Ignite is to drive revenue growth and margin expansion by increasing our execution capabilities. and so are we. That is exactly why we introduced our new market-focused organization structure. We are laser-focused on winning in the marketplace and adding value to our customers and shareholders. We will dive more deeply into these details including our evolved strategy and the Ignite transformation, that will help us execute on that strategy. At our investor day on December seventeenth in New York. Bob would now provide the details of the results as well as our outlook for the fiscal year of 2025 and the first quarter. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob. I've said it before and I want to say it again. These are exciting times at Agilent. Over the last several months, we've been focused on evolving our strategy, transforming our processes, and empowering our people while continuing to win in the marketplace. Already we've made bold moves that have created momentum. We've developed our future strategy, we've kicked off our Ignite transformation to help execute on that strategy. And along the way, we've made moves to create new growth vectors. We are making acquisitions that will contribute to our growth and we are strengthening our capability to efficiently and effectively integrate those acquisitions that will lay the foundation for future M&A. These initial actions position us well for the journey ahead. strength, and speed to reinvigorate our culture and enable us to thrive while delivering outstanding results for our customers and for our shareholders. And amid all this change, Fortune magazine this month named Agilent number eleven among the world's best workplaces 2024, a list that only includes twenty-five companies. This is yet another recognition of what we already know internally. The Agilent team is the best in the industry. This is not only a recognition of our outstanding company culture, of the talented professionals we have. resilient, and high performing. This is exactly the team we need to evolve Agilent. To build an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers, and creates value for our shareholders. Thank you again for joining today's call. I couldn't be more energized by the momentum we have, the opportunities we will seize, and the history we will make. Now I look forward to answering your questions. Parmeet? Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. Great question. So, you know, clearly, we're seeing a steady recovery in instruments and, you know, our book-to-bill was greater than one, which is really great to see. In terms of replacement cycle, what you would see across the industry is that it's not uniform. It's across different vendors at different speeds and, of course, at different times. But what we do see is that we have we're probably midway through the expected timing on where we expect that replacement cycle to be. We see competitors are probably benefiting from refresh of their own install base with some new systems. But what you would see from our side is our Infinity 3 that we announced last month. We expect to start seeing an increased demand for our solutions, and we're seeing a lot of excitement with our customer base. And we've already seen tens of millions of dollars in orders there. So what we expect in that replacement cycle is to be slow and steady, but really kicking off in Q1. Yeah. Thanks, Patrick. So performance was a bit better than expected, and it was also really encouraging to see lab activity to continue to improve across our services and consumables. So we actually have seen quite dramatic share gains within China, which is also a really good point. So what I would say is it's steadily improving. You know, talking to the teams. And I would say on the stimulus side, you know, we talked in the call about we've already have some stimulus orders in. We expect much more in Q1. That will, of course, translate to revenue. And this is a really, really good sign as we see momentum both from the direct input of more confidence in the market and, of course, getting the dollars in. So steadily improving, and we expect that through the year, Patrick. We expect as we go through the stimulus orders and we go forward, expect that to improve. One area that was really standout for us was PFAS in China. It was the fastest-growing business for us across the globe or region across the globe, and that just goes to show the durable nature of some of these growth factors that are happening where you have the emergent pollutants act moving. And what we've seen in China is that our great technical expertise coupled with our great solutions are already there to pick up the business. So that was one real clear standout. Thanks, Patrick. Yeah. I just said start off, and I'll kick it over to Simon. You know, as we really are seeing nice growth in our pathology business, which grew high single digits in Q4 and is slightly ahead of expectations. A highly durable business in any markets. What we're seeing in genomics, while it's a still challenging market, we posted low single-digit growth, which was also ahead of expectations. But, Simon, I don't know if you want to add some color. Yeah. Well, look, I think we're refocusing the groups really for a few reasons. We want to be closer to customers, but also understanding where do we want to make our biggest investment or most asymmetric that are going to accelerate innovation in key areas. And when I talk about focus, it's really three things. You know, it's the energy to time, but also the capital allocation. And what you will see from this refocusing of our segments, we're gonna be able to do that. You're gonna see programs accelerate. But also, we don't want to be two inches deep across the company. We want to be focused on our key growth factors and making sure we accelerate. We have a huge amount of product lines and, of course, we can have incremental additions to product lines across the board. But from this new structure, you're gonna see an acceleration of R&D. No doubt about it. Yeah. So in the chemical advance materials, we grew 1% and we sold 4% of materials, and that's driven, you know, a lot by our battery business that we have and, of course, semiconductor. We saw a slight decline in chemical and energy. But overall, we're very happy with the growth that we've seen in Asia ex-China, by the way, was driven and also low single digits in China. So the one thing that I would note about this industry is that we've got the broadest platform and solutions around it. And it's the CAM is returning to positive year on year growth for the first time since Q2 in 2023, so that really bodes well for the future. Yeah. So, you know, there's a lot of dynamism in terms of replacement cycle. You know, it doesn't happen at any time, as I said before, any one time, but it's across the board in different industries and different times. From our perspective, you know, our LC and LCMS orders are improving. There's no doubt about that. And we have a huge amount of excitement around our Infinity 3. We have a lot of focus programs with our customers around that. So what you will see next year is I think it's a steady increase in cadence of that replacement cycle. You know, it's a little bit too early to call. Will that be gradual over a number of quarters or a bolus in one quarter or maybe then a slowdown and again on the next quarter? But we're really watching that as we go forward. I think we're being very conservative around what we're seeing on that because of a lot of turbulences everybody has seen in the last few years in the market. But I would say customer sentiment is steadily improving. And on the GLP One side, you know, we had a really fantastic year. We grew 30% in GLP one this year. We're involved in a lot of new site build-outs in QAQC departments and actual getting closer to production as well with systems. So a very, very strong year. And actually one thing that's really interesting is through the acquisition of BioVectra, we, of course, have a healthy pipeline of GLP-one and synthetic peptides within their CDMO capability. We're seeing a lot of requests from both sides of the business about how we can help customers both on the analytical side and on the CDMO side. So we're seeing a huge amount of synergies there. So this is a market that's going to continue very strongly and we're going to be really there to take the business. Yeah. Look, there's a lot of changes that can happen at this time. You know, there's a lot of people expecting a lot of change. We have yet to see what those changes will be. Of course, you can see maybe some changes in the NIH funding, which is very low for us as a percentage of the business. We actually expect the PFAS spending will actually increase as it goes forward on it. The area to watch, I would say, is, of course, tariffs, which Bob talked about. We're ready for that. Ready for any scenario on that side. But also on biopharma, I think, is the IRA is also continues to move forward, the International Pricing Index seeing what happens on biopharma is gonna be really important. So that's why we're taking a kind of conservative and prudent approach. So lots going on. But what I would say is from the strategy work, I would imagine, we're ready for all outcomes. Yeah. Maybe I can start off by talking about our, you know, our US supply chain in there. About 60%, as Bob said, is produced in the United States. About 35% is the rest of the world. So it's actually a small percentage that's produced in China. But, of course, we have mitigations and steps there. We have many supply chain areas across the globe that we can move around, and we've done that before since 2018. We expect the impact probably in the quarter of $4 million to $5 million we can probably mitigate that within a few months. So I would say we're waiting to see how that all plays out. But we're already taking steps across potential tariffs. The big question for everybody is that will it be on will it be beyond China? I think everybody's waiting to see what that is, but even in that case, we're ready with mitigations. Yeah. You know, we had a minimal effect to be honest. We really planned around that and of course, we are very careful with our customers to make sure we bring them through the cycle of replacement. So minimal impact. You know, we're very extremely excited about it. You know, it's a system that not only will be best in class in terms of performance, but also in terms of productivity. And that's what we're hearing loud and clear from our customers. It's about productivity and how it lends their labs to be more productive going forward. We're extremely pleased with the order book that we've seen so far. And we expect that that will continue to ramp and, you know, customers are really voting with their orders on that. So we're excited about that ramp for next year. Yeah. Maybe I can start with the second part, Tycho. We're not seeing a pause from pharma validating. We're actually seeing a little bit more activity. So we're not seeing that across the board, and that's about the US and globally. And, of course, that's something we really want to watch with the new administration coming in. And what transpires over the next few weeks. But in terms of the LC and LCMS, Bob, I don't know if you got any color on those. Yeah. I'll start off, Tycho, and I'll hand it over to Simon. You know, first of all, we are extremely pleased on the cross-selling ability between the two businesses. It was one of the key sources of value about why we did the BioVectra acquisition that customers were asking us for this capability, a broader range of capability, and we've seen that actually accelerate from both sides. Simon, I don't know if you want to add more color on NESD. Yeah. We don't talk about a difference in pricing on it, you know, but I think we've had a number of years, of course, very, very successful years with the Infinity 2 and this builds on success. I will say that the installed base for Agilent is way broader than the Infinity 2. You know, we have 1100s that are very, very prominent out there. We have a lot of labs with 1100s and those are the labs for us, I think, that are gonna be talking about replacement. But we also have seen significant interest from Infinity 2 customers because the CDXTR productivity capability is really going to help them in the lab. So I would say it's not just, you know, one series to the next. It's a broad install base replenishment we're gonna see. I think you said it well. You know, we were very conservative in that because of those reasons, you know, what is the expected LC replacement cycle recovery? Is it faster? Is it, you know, is it a little bit less than that? The China stimulus, you know, which is very early days, you know, I think we want to make sure that we continue to monitor that. And, of course, whether we see improved conditions or not in terms of sentiment in the US. So all of these things are factoring into this. So it is conservative in what we're guiding, but also I'd say here, the bars are wider than normal. Yeah. Look. I think what we've seen is that it's much broader. The stimulus in terms of range. We spoke about that before. We see it, you know, both on commercial and government accounts. Our first orders have actually come in from government accounts. We've been highly successful in those overall tenders, and we're in the low millions range, low single-digit millions range of orders to bring. We're expecting to close much more this quarter. And one thing that's really playing into our favor is our broad platform capabilities. Including the technical capabilities of our teams up and running. And you couple that with our Made in China initiatives that we really invested over the last year, it puts us in a very, very strong position to capitalize, but it'll be interesting to see how that's launched. Past the first quarter, we don't have great visibility yet, but, of course, a lot of deal activity. But the first quarter is looking very strong in terms of orders. And I would say just following up on that, Bob, we're very excited to meet everybody in December in New York to talk about it. It's an extremely well-thought-out program. It's across the board. It's ultimately gonna help us to invest for growth in key areas as well as margin expansion. Yeah. I mean, look, we saw a lot of strength in Europe in terms of pharma. I wouldn't read too much into the American numbers. You know, I think there is, of course, companies wondering about their CapEx budgets and that comes at different phases. But we expect, we expect Pharma to continue."

            "name": "Simon May",
            "content": "Yeah. Just a quick couple of quick points to add. As Padraig mentioned, we were pretty pleased with the high single-digit growth that we saw in pathology in the quarter. And in particular, the blend and the mix between instruments and consumables there, we continue to be really healthy. With our instrument placements, and we think that sees us quite nicely going into 2025. On the genomic side, it was really notable because it's the first time that we've seen growth in genomics for quite a while now. I'd say we've had a bit of a pivot in our strategy there to really double down on the growth drivers that we see in genomics, where we've got clearly differentiated value propositions and in particular, our Magnus automated NGS library prep continues to see fantastic traction. We're also very encouraged by the pipeline that we're seeing for our Aveda NGS chemistry. And, again, this gives us a lot of hope going into FY 2025. And as I think about pathology and genomics and these growth factors that we see here, we do believe that they're durable given the macro conditions and the competitive position that we enjoy. Yeah. Just to build on what Padraig said with BioVectra and the NASD cross-pollination, there's been really strong engagement between the teams. In fact, they spent several days together in our Boulder facility last week, and I'd say they came away really energized that the portfolio complementarity fit between businesses is exactly as we expected. In fact, maybe a little bit more so. Then as we think about NASD going into FY 2025, I think as Bob mentioned earlier, we're projecting high single-digit growth for the business. The order book looks really strong in NASD, but it's important to understand the nuances of the mix in that order book. We've got a number of commercialization qualifications going on right now. So in terms of FY 2025 revenue, there's a lot of energy going into that with relatively limited revenue upside, and a lot of that's gonna actually hit towards FY 2026. But, again, the order book overall is very healthy. And as we think about twelve, eighteen, twenty-four months view, we're really bullish about what we're seeing. But once again, high single-digit growth, maybe we'll nudge double-digit in NASD in FY 2025?"
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "We Thank you, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on fourth quarter revenue and take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I will then cover our guidance for fiscal year 2025 and the first quarter of 2025. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results. As Padraig said, we are pleased with our Q4 results. Agilent finished the fourth quarter, with core growth in line with our expectations while EPS exceeded our expectations as we executed well against a challenging albeit improving market. Q4 revenue was $1.701 billion, a decline of 0.3% core but a sequential improvement of over four hundred basis points. On a reported basis, our revenues were up 0.8% as we benefited from fifty basis points of currency and BioVectra contributed sixty basis points. Looking at our Q4 performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $833 million in revenue. That represents a 1% decline as instrument volumes continue to be constrained, by conservative customer CapEx spending while consumables grew mid-single digits. Having said that, for our instruments business, our orders grew year on year and for the third consecutive quarter, our book-to-bill was once again greater than one. We see this as positive evidence of an ongoing steady instrument recovery. Moving on to Agilent CrossLab Group, the business delivered revenue of $426 million for the quarter, 5%. ACG grew in every market and in every region except China, where it was flat year over year but up sequentially. The contracts business including our fast-growing enterprise services business, double digits again in Q4 as it has every quarter this year. Our largest customers continue to maximize utilization of their assets, right-size their operations, and leverage OpEx budgets to deliver on their productivity goals and outcomes. We recently received a top supplier award from one of our largest strategic customers in the applied markets as a recognition of our long-standing and beneficial partnership throughout the years. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $442 million in revenue, representing a 3% decline that was slightly above expectations. Pathology saw solid growth globally, and was offset by expected softness in NESD and cell analysis instruments. Now looking at our end markets and geographies, our largest end market, pharma, declined 1%, slightly better than what we expected. Within pharma, biopharma declined mid-single digits while small molecule grew low single digits. Encouragingly, all regions except for the Americas, grew in the quarter. The Americas region was pressured by the expected decline of NASD. We expect both the Americas region and NASD to return to growth in fiscal year 2025. In chemicals and advanced materials, revenue grew 1% with our advanced materials submarket growing mid-single digits driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical end market performed strongly growing 7% driven by pathology, and improved performance in genomics. we declined 6% although dollars were roughly flat sequentially. All regions grew except for the US, related to timing of orders. That being said, we continue to see very strong growth in PFAS solutions. With our business growing more than 40% in Q4 across multiple end markets. Now wrapping up our end markets, food was down 3% versus last year. While our academia and government market was down 1%. Geographically, Asia ex-China high single digits and Europe grew low single digits in the quarter while the Americas and China declined as expected. China was down only 3% and exceeded our expectations. We also booked our first China stimulus orders in October and anticipate much more in fiscal year 2025. Now let's move to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 55.1% in the quarter, down seventy basis points versus last year driven by lower volume and mix. Our operating margin was 27.4% as our productivity initiatives and the cost actions we took earlier in the year were fully recognized this quarter. The annualization of these savings coupled with the market recovery and the initial returns from the Ignite transformation, give us confidence in driving EPS growth in fiscal year 2025. In addition, we continue to look for ways to drive EPS growth below the line. Our net interest income was in line while we benefited from a lower tax rate in the quarter and our share count was 287 million diluted shares outstanding. Now putting it all together, Q4 earnings per share was $1.46, that was ahead of our expectations and up 6% from a year ago. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $481 million in the quarter, and we invested $93 million in capital expenditures. For the year, we well exceeded our operating cash flow expectations. With operating cash flow of $1.75 billion during the quarter, we returned over $400 million to shareholders, consisting of $335 million in share repurchases, and $68 million in dividends. For the year, we returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders, through repurchasing shares and dividends. Looking forward, you may have also seen recently we announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend. Marking another year of increases advancing our industry-leading dividend. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.1, a very strong number even as we acquired BioVectra in the quarter. Our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet provide us with plenty of opportunity to invest in the business going forward. In summary, we performed well and saw steady market improvement in the quarter. We are executing well, staying disciplined, and investing in high-growth opportunities. Now let's move on to our outlook for the upcoming fiscal year and first quarter. We expect the recovery that we have seen the past few quarters to continue throughout fiscal 2025. While we expect the market to grow slower than historical rates for the full year, we expect improvement throughout the year with the second half of the year returning to more traditional levels of growth. We expect our results to mirror that cadence of improvement on a core basis. As Padraig noted earlier, we exited Q4 with a book-to-bill ratio over one for the company, and greater than one for instruments. In addition, Q4 was the first quarter in 2024 that instrument orders grew year on year. While one quarter does not a trend make, it is certainly encouraging. For the full year guide, we expect revenue in the range of $6.79 to $6.87 billion. This represents a reported growth range of 4.3% to 5.5%. Currency is a slight headwind of 0.2 points while M&A related to BioVectra contributes 2% at the low end and 2.2% at the high end. This translates to a core growth of 2.5% to 3.5%. To start the year, we think this is a prudent way to plan given the near-term dynamics in the US. From a geographic perspective, we expect modest growth in the Americas and Europe. While we see funnel activity increasing in China, we are taking a conservative approach on the timing of revenue associated with the stimulus. We expect to see recovery over the course of the year in China, resulting in slightly positive growth for the full year. From a business group perspective, we expect to return to growth in all three groups led by ACG. As a note, this statement is true under the new structure as well. As Parmeet mentioned earlier, we will provide recast historical segment information to reflect these changes ahead of our upcoming investor day. In terms of phasing, we expect improvement throughout the year with more normalized growth expected in the second half of the year. We are projecting roughly fifty to seventy basis points of operating margin expansion for the year. Below the line, we expect net interest expense of $25 million due to the financing of BioVectra versus the net interest income this year. In addition, we expect a tax rate of 13% and 286 million shares outstanding. Fiscal 2025 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.54 to $5.61 and incorporates the planned five cents year one dilution from BioVectra. This range represents a 5% to 6% growth rate if excluding the BioVectra dilution, a growth rate of 6% to 7% year on year. We expect cash flow to remain strong in fiscal year 2025. We are expecting roughly $1.65 billion in operating cash flow and $450 million in CapEx as 2025 is the peak spending year for the NASD expansion. Looking to Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion. Our forecast assumes no significant budget flush during the end of this calendar year. This represents a reported decline of 0.5% to growth of 1.3%. Currency is a thirty basis point headwind while M&A is expected to contribute 1.8 points of growth. We are expecting core growth between a decline of 2% to flat at the upper end. It's important to note that we estimate our projected Q1 year-over-year results will be negatively impacted this year by roughly two percentage points due to timing of the Lunar New Year which occurs in late January, versus February of last year. This includes the additional $15 million in revenue pull forward we communicated in Q1 of last year. Adjusting for the Lunar New Year impact, we are expecting continued sequential growth improvement. First quarter 2025 non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28. Lower than the full year growth rate due to the Lunar New Year timing. Looking into 2025 and beyond, we remain incredibly optimistic about the future of our markets and our long-term prospects. We are confident in our new market-focused approach and the Ignite transformation will propel us to accelerated growth and we will become a stronger company. With that, I'll turn it back over to Padraig for some closing comments. They ensure we are building the capability Ones who are ambitious, Yeah. Hey, Patrick. Just want to add on to what Padraig is saying. Yeah. You're absolutely right. We ended the quarter with roughly $310 million, $312 to be precise, in China. Which was a nice sequential increase from Q3 and, you know, it was down 3% as I mentioned. In addition to the PFAS, both chemical and advanced materials actually grew in the quarter. We're, you know, we have a leadership position and pharma was flat, which was actually a very nice thing. And we're taking a kind of a conservative approach, as I mentioned, in terms of the stimulus orders, but we've seen quite active funnel from the standpoint of bidding activity here in the first half of this quarter as well as and expect that to continue throughout the course of 2025. Yeah. Hey, Rachael. This is Bob. I'll take that question. As you can imagine, there's been a fair amount of work that we've been doing on this exact question. What I would take it if I took it into two chunks, actually, we've been working on diversifying our supply chain particularly within China, you know, China, back in eighteen, nineteen when the first tariffs came and then, obviously, double down on that resiliency with COVID. And so it is ten to fifteen million dollars existing today. And we think that the future potential magnitude of this is certainly manageable with us with additional mitigation activities. Obviously, with something that would be more broad-based than that, it would be more material. But to just give you a frame of reference, roughly two-thirds of our business in the US comes from product that's sourced in the US. Yeah. Hey, Rachael. And maybe just for the benefit of you and the rest of the folks on the call, I talked about guidance. If you look at it by end market, just to kinda give everyone a frame, you know, for the full year FY 2025, we're expecting pharma to return to growth. So low to mid-single-digit growth there. Academia government roughly flat. Actually, expect the diagnosis and clinical that Simon just talked about to continue and be the highest growth end market, at least to start off the year here in FY 2025 at mid-single digits. CAM also low to mid, given the work and the discussion that Padraig just gave. And then food and environmental, both low single digits with pockets of very strong growth. And really, you know, food, there was a potential where the actually could accelerate throughout the course of the year given some of the potential changes in the administration coming up. Yeah, Vijay. That's exactly right. So, you know, obviously, our first quarter is what I would call artificially depressed just because of the way of the nature of our timing of our fiscal year relative to Lunar New Year. But if you looked at first half versus second half, we're expecting this continued recovery throughout the course of the year. And with a more normalized growth in the back half of the year. And so where does that show up? It shows up in a couple of areas. Obviously, with the potential for China getting better throughout the course of the year. As Padraig mentioned, certainly, stimulus can help that. We've taken a conservative approach on that and not fully baked in with all the activity that we talked about. We'll see how that plays out, but certainly early days are very positive from that standpoint. And then also from a pharma perspective, we're also expecting to see that recovery particularly on the back of Infinity 3 as Padraig just mentioned, and that replacement cycle accelerating. So you're actually seeing those that would be the two biggest and then, you know, continued biotech recovery on the small biotech side as well throughout the course of next year. Yeah. So Q1, so let me answer your question around free cash flow. Yeah. We are expecting a slight slip down really a result of a step up in CapEx spending this year versus last year. As we, you know, finished the heavy levels of spending for the NASD expansion for Trane CND. I don't expect that to continue into 2026 and 2027, so you would see that then step back down. So that free cash flow is really a timing issue. In terms of Q1, profitability with the lower revenue, we typically have higher expenses in Q1 as some of the merit resets. We've got our sales meetings and kickoffs meetings there, and then you've got, you know, some January typically is a very light month, but we have a full amount of expenses in there. And then you then also look at the Ignite transformation that Padraig talked about, many of those activities that we've been kicking off will come into play in the second half of the year, which will generate incremental savings both on the top line and the bottom line. And what you'll hear more about that, some of those details at the Investor Day in mid-December. Yeah. I could do that. So if you think about this at, I'll call it legacy number. So LSAG kinda low single digits with the consumables business being kind of mid-single-digit and slower on the instrument throughout the course of the year. That's probably our area where we've taken a prudent approach as we go through the course of the year. It could be more than that, depending on the uptake of the replacement cycle INFINITY 3, but low single digits there. ACG continued to be very strong with mid to high single digits as the instrumentation recovery and then continued double-digit on the services business. Just continues to be a real stalwart of growth, and we still have a lot of opportunity there around rate. And then for DGG, kind of low to mid-single-digit growth. Going forward, which is a recovery, you know, the continued performance of pathology in the genomics businesses, as Simon mentioned, and then a return to growth really for NESD. Hey, Jack. Just to build on what Padraig is saying on the LC replacement cycle, I think one of the things is, you know, we're taking a more conservative approach as Padraig mentioned. And I think if that happens, we will get that business rest assured. I would also say, if we look at the age of our installed base, it is continuing to get old. It is well beyond the median now. And throughout the course of next year. So we would expect that to continue to be able to be replaced. Because when we look at the instrumentation through our consumables business and our services business, the activity continues to be high. So these instruments are being used, and so it's only a matter of time to be able to do that replacement. In aggregate across all platforms, our expectation is that it will grow. Low single digits. Yeah. Hey, Puneet. To build on what Padraig is saying, particularly for retaliatory tariffs in China, very little of our revenue now is produced in the US that goes into China. We spent a lot of time and effort building in China for China, and we have a full portfolio of capabilities there. Which is actually really important for us to be able to take full advantage of the stimulus products today. So, and, you know, I think that number will be relatively small. From the standpoint of retaliatory impact from China exports from the US. Yeah. Hey, Tycho. Just to give you a couple of different pieces of data. If I look at our pharma business overall, it was down low single digits. Pharma, small molecule was actually up 3% overall with biotech or biopharma being down. If we look at specifically LC, LCMS, within pharma, it was up low single digits. Yeah. All I would say is pricing has held up very nicely. Early days. Yeah. That's a great question. So roughly half is NASD between the continued build-out and the validation activities of that $450 million. If I look at, kinda maintenance CapEx, think about it in, you know, kinda two and a half to three times sales. Range on a go-forward basis. Yeah, Doug. You know, you heard it right. Our small molecule business was up low single digits across both instruments. You know, it was the combination of instruments and services. And our biotech, our large molecule was down mid-singles. Now if you took out NASD, which shows up in the large molecule, it was down low single digits. So better recovery than the mid-single digits. And it actually speaks to, I think, that continuation of volume in small molecule. You know, if you look at pill count, it continues to go up. And these are, you know, well-capitalized companies. They have probably the older fleet you just think about kind of the replacement versus kind of the biotechs of the world, and so we're expecting that to continue and, it was the first to kind of go down. And so we're, you know, in the cycle, and I think we're expecting it to be the first, you know, moving positive. Now we think there's more upside in biotech than there is in small molecule, but it certainly is a nice leading indicator around the idea around this replacement cycle. Yeah. Hey, Mike. And just to kind of frame it, kind of how we're thinking about China to your point. If we took Q4 and just divide it by or multiply it by four, that would get you to that low single-digit growth. Now we're expecting a recovery throughout the course of the year, but that kind of gives you a sense for what we put in the initial guide and we'll know a lot more about those timing of the stimulus revenues going forward. You know, once we actually get those awarded and then the delivery dates and so forth. But we do think that that'll occur throughout the course of the year. Yeah. What I would say, Mike, is it's a little of all those things. So maybe stay tuned, and we'll give you a little more meat on the bones here come mid-December. But we certainly have some incremental opportunities both in price and, you know, cost efficiencies associated with the Ignite transformation. And those things will start to feather into the second half of this year, as I mentioned before. If you recall, the first half of this year also has the annualization of the savings of the actions that we had to take in the June, July time frame as well. So we're benefiting and then you also have the merit increases and so forth that gets reset. And so you'll actually see this throughout the course of the year through a series of initiatives that have already been kicked off. Yeah, Dan, if we looked at the long-term growth rates of our markets, we believe those are mid-single digits, you know, four to when you look at the aggregate across. We're obviously not expecting that for the full year here. We are expecting that we're doing better than the market. If you look at kinda how we exited here roughly flat on a core basis, you know, if you adjust for the timing of Lunar New Year, you know, you had the midpoint one percent, you know, and expect that kind of performance to continue that cadence. And so you would have the second half of the year a more normalized kind of growth rates. And so it's really across the board. We're seeing, you know, some of the industrial or applied markets things like CAM being a little ahead of the curve and certainly our diagnostics and clinical business continues to be strong. It has been throughout the course of this year. Exiting at a very healthy rate, and I would expect that to continue. The big ones are pharma coming in and then, you know, some of the other applied markets as well."

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja, to begin. Please go ahead.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Phil Binns, President of the Agilent Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; Simon May, President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Angelica Riemann, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our third quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion, along with a recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rate. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure related to the move of our Cell Analysis business from LSAG into DGG. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risk and other factors. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Thanks, Parmeet. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. The Agilent team executed well in the third quarter and posted solid results, delivering better-than-expected revenue and earnings. Revenue of $1.578 billion, declined 4.4%, an improvement of 300 basis points from Q2, reflecting the steady improvement in the market. Operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially, as the actions we announced last quarter start to deliver. And we remain on-track to deliver the incremental annualized savings of $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. Earnings per share of $1.32 is $0.04 above the high end of guidance. As a result of our strong Q3 performance, we are raising our guidance at the midpoint for both revenue and EPS and we continue to make investments in our most promising growth opportunities that I referenced in our Q2 call. We are investing in our digital ecosystem to further enhance our differentiated customer experience, plus we are mobilizing the organization to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives, driving margin expansion and growth and increasing our execution capabilities. Separately in the quarter, we were excited to announce two acquisitions that demonstrate our focus on biopharma and our digital ecosystem, which I'll talk about in a moment. As you know well, the pace of change is faster than ever. Our markets, customers and competitors are not standing still, neither are we. We are accelerating our pace of innovation and execution, so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities in front of us. We are sharply focused on key growth vectors, including biopharma, PFAS and Advanced Materials. I continue to meet and connect with employees, customers and shareholders around the globe to listen to their perspectives on how we should build on our strengths and move Agilent forward. The entire Agilent team is clear on what is vital to the company's future, becoming even more customer focused and even more nimble to continue to win in the marketplace and add value to customers and shareholders. We are evolving our strategy, adapting quickly to market trends and changes, while accelerating our pace of innovation in areas of greatest return for long-term growth. We're excited to announce that you'll hear more about these topics and our transformation at our Investor Day we have planned in New York on December 17th. Now, let's talk further about our Q3 results. All our end markets except academia and government, which is our smallest, ended the quarter better-than-expected. Our largest market pharma declined high-single-digits, slightly better than our expectations and while biopharma continues to be pressured, we are seeing relatively better performance in small molecule. Our leadership in providing workflow solutions for PFAS continued to show strong performance in the environmental markets. Geographically, Europe exceeded expectations led by small-molecule pharma, as well as continued strength in environmental. Our other regions performed roughly in-line with expectations. While capital equipment budgets remain constrained, we continue to see good lab activity in Q3 with services plus consumables growing mid-single digits. When looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $782 million in revenue, down 7%, while the instrument side of the business remains constrained, it was encouraging that our instrument book-to-bill was again greater than one. The group saw a decline across all regions and most end-markets with low single-digit growth in Environmental & Forensics. The Consumables continue to be a bright spot, growing by mid-single digit. The LSAG team also was busy innovating with the introduction of the 8850 GC that helps customers reach their sustainability goals by delivering answers efficiently, while using up to 30% less power than other GC's and has a much smaller footprint. Moving on to the Agilent CrossLab Group, the business delivered revenue of $411 million for the quarter, up mid-single digit. ACG grew in every region except China, where we were down modestly year-on-year, but showed meaningful improvement versus last quarter. Once again, we drove double-digit growth in service contracts, which represented nearly 70% of the total business. And beyond another quarter of solid revenue growth, ACG also delivered a record operating margin of 34%, demonstrating that the resiliency and strength of the recurring revenue business continues despite the constrained capital equipment environment. The continued strength of our business is a testament to our strategy of increasing the connect rates on our instruments and the ongoing value we are providing to our customers in helping them reach their productivity goals. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $385 million in revenue, representing an 8% decline. Pathology grew mid-single digits globally and was offset by declines in Cell Analysis, NASD and genomics. NASD stepped down sequentially in Q3 as expected and we are on track for NASD's revenues to step-up sequentially in Q4. In the face of a constrained CapEx environment, the Agilent team has remained consistent in putting our customers first and fostering deeper relationships with them. We continue to execute well and be disciplined, while investing in high-growth opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to announce two acquisitions, that speak to our focus on biopharma and increasing recurring revenue, as well as on strengthening the digital ecosystem for Agilent customers. In late July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire BIOVECTRA, a leading specialized contract development and manufacturing organization. The Canada-based company builds on Agilent's capabilities in oligonucleotides and CRISPR therapeutics by expanding our portfolio of services. BIOVECTRA adds rapidly growing modalities in microbial fermentation, antibody-drug conjugates and high-potency active pharmaceutical ingredients. It also brings world-class capabilities that when combined with NASD enables us to deliver customers a complete gene editing solution. The company delivered more than $110 million in revenue during the calendar year 2023 and expects double-digit revenue growth this year. The BIOVECTRA acquisition remains on-track to be closed by the end of the year and we're looking-forward to welcoming the BIOVECTRA team to Agilent. At the end of the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of California-based Sigsense, a start-up that uses artificial intelligence and power monitoring to help customers optimize their lab operations. Sigsense Technology already is available to our customers through CrossLab Connect, a suite of digital applications that improve lab performance. A hearty welcome to the Sigsense team who already is part of Agilent. During the quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which showcases a large and growing portfolio of products that help our customers reach their sustainability goals. Instruments certified with the My GreenLab ACT label now accounts for 40% of all instrument revenue and we continue to regularly release products like the new 8850 GC with environmental benefits. We are also proud that we have recently ranked in the top 20 of Time Magazine's 500 Most Sustainable companies in the world. Bob will now provide the details on our results, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Thanks, Padraig and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full-year and fourth quarter guidance. Q3 revenue was $1.578 billion, a decline of 4.4% core, but a 300 basis-point sequential improvement as Padraig noted. Excluding China, revenue declined low-single digits in the quarter. On a reported basis, currency had a negative impact of 1.1 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 10 basis points, resulting in a reported decline of 5.6%. Our largest end market pharma declined 8%. Biopharma was down low double-digits or down mid-single digits, excluding NASD. Small molecule performed better, down mid-single digits and was led by growth in Europe. Services and pharma continues to perform well, growing high single-digit. In Chemical & Advanced Materials, revenue declined 5%, with growth in Americas offset by softness in China. Our Advanced Materials sub-segment performed better, driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Academia and government, our smallest market, can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We saw a decline of 11% as Europe and China both saw double-digit declines, partially offset by better performance in the Americas region. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical end-market grew 2%, including continued mid-single digit growth in pathology, offset by ongoing softness in genomics. In Environmental & Forensics, we grew 4%, another great quarter for our PFAS testing business. We saw robust business in Europe, led by the new EU Water Directive and in China due to the nationwide emerging pollutants program. Now wrapping up our end-markets, food was down 3% versus last year, but grew sequentially and was led by Asia, ex-China. Moving on to our regional performance, Europe was flat overall, beating our expectations, while we declined 6% in the Americas and declined 1% in Asia, ex-China. China revenue declined 11% with quarterly revenue improving sequentially, driven by growth in services and consumables. This speaks to some increase in lab activity, which is encouraging. Now, let's move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 56.0% in the quarter, down slightly versus a year-ago, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Our operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially and was better-than-expected. Despite the dampened demand, we continue to make good progress in driving our productivity initiatives and continuing to manage the cost structure very well, while investing for growth. As Padraig mentioned, we are on track to deliver the $100 million in incremental annualized cost-savings by the end of the fiscal year. Below the line, our net interest income was in line as was our tax rate of 13% and we had $291 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.32. That was ahead of our expectations, but down 7.7% from a year ago as we went up against a difficult compare due to the variable pay reset in Q3 of last year. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $452 million in the quarter and we invested $92 million in capital expenditures. As we committed in Q2, we ramped-up our share repurchases starting here in Q3. We purchased $585 million in shares and paid out $68 million through dividends, for a total of $653 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. This includes $500 million of the previously announced $750 million opportunistic share repurchase and we expect to complete the additional $250 million repurchase in Q4. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of $0.6 and even with the upcoming BIOVECTRA acquisition, our balance sheet and leverage ratios will still be in a very strong position. In summary, we performed well and continue to see a steady improvement in the market and expect that to continue into FY 2025. Because of our Q3 results, we are increasing the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $6.450 billion to $6.500 billion. This represents a decline of 5.6% to 4.9% on a reported basis and a decline of 5.0% to 4.3% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 60 basis points. Full-year non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $5.21 and $5.25, representing a decline of 4.2% to 3.5%. This assumes net interest income of $38 million, a 13% tax rate and $292 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We have not included any impact of the BIOVECTRA acquisition in our updated guidance and $0.06 does not have a material financial impact to the year or Q4. This full-year guidance translates into Q4 revenue in the range of $1.641 billion to $1.691 billion. This represents a decline of 1.9% to 1.1% growth on a core basis and a decline of 2.8% to 0.2% growth on a reported basis. Currency and M&A are a combined headwind of 90 basis-points. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.38 and $1.42, marking a return to growth at the midpoint. We expect a 13% tax rate, a decrease in net interest income to $5 million due to the lower cash balance and $287 million diluted shares outstanding for the quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Padraig for some closing comments. Padraig?\nPadraig McDonnell: These are exciting times at Agilent, with a team that is second to known, we are doubling down on our customer force culture and deepening our relationships to further enhance our market leading customer experience that is already the best in the industry. We are evolving our strategy to aggressively pursue our ambition to grow in markets where we have a right to win through both organic and inorganic growth and we will continue to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives. We remain a leader across key platforms and we're in great long-term growth markets that are beginning to show evidence of recovery. And best of all, our team is engaged, leading to Newsweek including Agilent on its America's Greatest Workplaces 2024 list. Again, thank you for joining today's call. I'm energized by how we are evolving Agilent. Each data team gains momentum in building an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers and creates value for our shareholders. We are fueled by the future possibilities and I look forward to continuing to share our progress. Parmeet, over to you for Q&A.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sykes: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe the first one, just digging in a little bit on the LSAG where you had a pretty solid beat. It looks like that was driven primarily by consumables and services. So, I'm curious if you can give any more color on what instruments did? I know you had a book-to-bill above one, but just how does that inform your view as we go into 2025 on the replacement cycle, specifically large biopharma demand and how that might impact your view on when that replacement cycle starts kicking-in?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks a lot, Matt, maybe I'll kick it off and give it to Bob. I think, first of all, you're correct, we saw very, very promising growth in both Consumables & Services, which shows lab activity is actually improving or is very stable. We're still very challenged on the instrument side, but what we're seeing is, we're seeing a lot of activity around conversations with lab managers. Our funnel is extremely stable. We haven't seen any -- any cancellations. But what I would say is that, deal closure times are still elevated. So we're not at this point seeing any budget towards the end of the year and which of course for us ends at the end of October, but we're watching that closely. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Thanks, Matt, for that question and maybe just to fill in and add some additional commentary to what Padraig was saying. When we looked at the quarter, we were very pleased actually both our Consumables business, as well as our Instrument business performed better-than-expected in the quarter. We were down 7% in total. Our Consumables business was actually up mid-single digits towards the high-end there. And our Instruments business was down low-double-digits, but that was better than what we expected. And as Padraig mentioned, we had a book-to-bill that was greater than one on the instrument side again this quarter, which was very encouraging.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. Thanks for that. Very helpful. And then just on Academic & Government, I know you've talked about it and you've talked about it for a while, how volatile that can be, but just given sort of the two quarters in a row of sort of negative performance there and you called out Europe and China specifically. Are there any kind of durable trends you're seeing either in funding or in demand that you think might be more persistent in that specific end-market as we go through Q4 and then as we look into 2025?\nPadraig McDonnell: No, I think, look, we saw a decline of about 11% and that was really against the comparative feature, the stimulus in EMEA and strong results in APAC and China. And so it was a really tough compare. And I think what we're seeing is funding remains stable in most regions and except I would say Europe where we're seeing a reallocation of funding towards defense, but I would say no major changes in that market.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Perfect. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions you guys. I wanted to dig into NASD a little bit. Obviously, we had some positive announcements intra quarter with the Helios-B readout. You mentioned that NASD stepped down sequentially as expected and then you said you're expecting that to then step up into fiscal 4Q. So could you unpack all that for us a little bit? How should we think about the magnitude of the step-up into 4Q? And then given some of the updated data readouts that we got intra quarter, how does that underpin your assumptions on NASD next year and then also long-term?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I'll start off and maybe I'll hand it over to Simon, who is on the call here as well. We've seen, with clinical batches, of course, there can be changes with customers progress in those batches. We're not seeing any changes in what we're saying for Q4, so we're fairly certain of Q4 on that. What we're seeing as well is that we've grown our clinical business over 50% this year, which is very promising. The long range view of the market is very strong with the drugs and the modalities that are being used. But I think what you're seeing is a normal kind of up and down between quarters with that business. But I don't know if you want to add any more color, Simon?\nSimon May: Yes, I'd just echo what Padraig said, I think the Q3 performance that we saw in NASD was largely in line with expectations. And in that business, we always see a natural lag between order booking activity and revenue recognition because of the length of time that these programs take. And towards the end of last year, we were really seeing the effects of the IRA impacts and that's still not completely waned, but what we saw in Q3 was pretty strong bookings activity. So as we look to Q4 and into 2025, I think we're cautiously optimistic about seeing a return to growth there. So I'd really just characterize Q3 as in line with expectations and part and parcel of the lumpiness you see in this business. You also mentioned Helios, I think it's just worth mentioning that we were very happy to see that development, but still very early days in terms of how that's going to ramp up and play out and too soon to say where that's concerned. There's certainly no impact in the remainder of 2024 and unlikely in 2025 as well.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Rachel, this is Bob. Just to add-on a little more to answer your last part of your question in terms of the sequential step-up where we had talked -- as Simon and Padraig had said, we've done a little better actually in Q3 than we expected and we're expecting a roughly $20 million step-up from Q3 to Q4. Those orders are all in-house and we're still on-track for the long -- the full-year estimate for NASD and that's incorporated into our guidance.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. That's helpful. Then for my follow-up, I just wanted to dig a little bit more into 4Q guidance and what that means in terms of an exit-rate into 2025. So appreciate some of your comments earlier, you highlighted in Matt's question that you're not really assuming a budget flush for your fiscal year end in October. But I guess, how should investors look at this 4Q number on an organic growth basis of that down 2% to up 1% on the range. And how do we look at that translating into 2025? If I look at consensus right now, consensus is just shy of 5% organic on 2025, Street is also nearing that double digit EPS growth. So I appreciate it's still a little bit early for you guys to formally give us 2025 expectation, but what do you think about exit rate and where sell-side numbers are right now?\nBob McMahon: Yes, you were reading my mind, Rachel. This is Bob and it is a little too early to talk about FY 2025. But I think what it does show is our expectation of this continued steady improvement. We improved here in Q3, 300 basis-points sequentially. We're expecting another improvement here going into Q4. And I would expect that improvement to continue into FY 2025. So -- and we do expect -- while it's too early to give you a specific number, we do expect to grow next year. These markets will return and we've been below the long-term trend, but there's nothing to suggest that the or the long-term growth rates of these markets, there's nothing to suggest that these markets have changed and so we're optimistic about continued recovery going into FY 2025.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Understood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Bob, maybe one for me, just on China, how you guys are thinking about the region there? It sounds like it was down 11%, that got a little bit better on the revenue side sequentially. It sounds like again, lab activity maybe look a little bit better. Could you just talk about expectations into year-end? Some of your peers have suggested you could see a bit of a pause on the capital side into calendar year-end as we wait for a little clarity on the stimulus. Just how you guys are thinking about China, again, not only into your fiscal year, but just into the year-end on the calendar side and what's your view in terms of do we see a little bit of an air pocket here until the good news dollars get firmed up?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, Patrick. It's a great question and we had actually seen a little of that in our Q2 of last -- just a quarter ago here really on the bid activity, primarily for instrumentation. We are optimistic about the mid-term here in terms of the stimulus. That's probably more FY 2025 event probably. But what we are seeing is more activity there and I think what's encouraging and maybe I can turn it over to Angelica as well, our services business has seen an increase in a pickup in activity and certainly we saw consumables as well. So it still dampened demand and we did see that impact in Academia & Government, that was the biggest impact in China, but we are seeing some pockets of green shoot in terms of recovery.\nAngelica Riemann: Yes, Bob, I'll just add. In China, we are encouraged from a services perspective on the nice sequential growth that we saw from Q2 to Q3, which is indicative of continued and somewhat increasing lab activity in China.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That sounds encouraging. And then maybe another one for you, Bob. Just as we think about the margin construct as we work our way into year end and into 2025, maybe just remind us some of the moving pieces to think about high-level as we look ahead to next year, obviously, the cost out program seems to be progressing well to your point, the margins came in nicely here in 3Q. But yeah, maybe just the moving pieces as we go ahead to next year without talking too much about the top line, obviously, the volume matters there. But just kind of down the P&L, how to think about some of the margin algo for next year would be helpful.\nBob McMahon: Yes, I think as we talked about, Patrick, it's a great question and we're committed to continuing to drive efficiencies across all of the P&L line items and I think you've seen that across the actions that we've taken. We're on track to delivering that $100 million of incremental annualized savings by the end of 2024. So there will still be a tailwind, obviously going into 2025 for that benefit. Offsetting that will be some resets of our variable pay and activities like that, but we are committed to covering that. If I think about it at the highest level, what I would expect us to continue to be able to do is drive leveraged earnings next year. And I think you're seeing that the scale benefit that we're seeing in certainly our ACG business here this last quarter, just phenomenal profit contribution and I think with volume coming back into the instrument business as well, that will set us up nicely for next year. So think about a nice incremental tailwind associated with the continued actions or the annualization of that actions that come in FY 2025, partially offset by merit in some of the activities and then we'll have our ongoing productivity measures and some -- we'll actually share some of the more detail around this probably in our Analyst Day in December. So stay-tuned on that as well.\nPatrick Donnelly: Thanks. Okay. That's great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to dig into some of these instrument trends a little bit more. I was wondering, if you could talk about just what you're seeing across some of the big categories like LC, LCMS, GC, spectroscopy, any color on how those performed?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I mean in general terms, Jack, I think you know the customers are very, very cautious. But what I will say is that lab manager remain very engaged with our sales teams about future projects, that is true. We see a lot of stability in that. So it's still very challenged and I would say that, you know our deal close rate is still elevated, but our funnels are very stable with low cancellations. So I think that goes across most of the markets. And as you see going-forward, you know our results in CST and services growing mid-single digits and bodes very, very well in terms of lab activity increasing. So we're seeing slow, but steady improvement.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Jack, just to follow-on to that. I think one of the things as we mentioned in the call, the book-to-bill being at one for instruments is a positive sign. It was slightly better than what we expected. Overall, LSAG instruments were down low-double-digit.\nJack Meehan: Yes. Yeah. Were all the categories kind of right around there?\nPadraig McDonnell: I would say if you looked at the LC and LCMS business, they were in the mid-teens, our spectroscopy business better than that.\nJack Meehan: Okay. And then just as one end-market follow-up, I was curious in CAM in the third quarter, so it was down 5%, it was a little bit below what I was thinking. Is there anything just within the different categories within that end-market that softened a little bit relative to what you were thinking a few months ago?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So, you're correct, it was declined by 5% and it was really due to the impact of overproduction in China, which negatively impacted market investments globally. But we did see increases in service and consumables, both combined at 7% increase, but there was a decrease of about 14% in instruments and I think CapEx spending remains slightly challenged there.\nJack Meehan: Yes. That makes sense. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One, I guess, Padraig or Bob, if you look at the guidance change over the last three months, NASD, China, biopharma, those have been the big categories, right? I think the guide assumes NASD doubled -- down double digits in fiscal 2024, China down high singles, double-digits, biopharma down, which of these is expected to get better next year? What is getting better or worse? And is there a first-half versus second-half dynamic that we should be aware of?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. I think in terms of what we expect getting better, we expect all of them to improve next year. We raised the midpoint of guidance, $15 million on revenue and $0.03 in EPS and we see across all those areas, markets improving slowly and that's reflected in the sequential increase that we're guiding in Q4. So while we had a kind of a solid Q3, the end market environment for capital remains constrained and visibility while improving is still difficult.\nVijay Kumar: Understood. And maybe on that Q4 commentary for guidance implies I think up 6% or 7%, which seems generally in line with your historical sequential step-up from 3Q. And is the bookings trends that we saw and NASE trends we saw, does it support that historical, I guess, seasonality because I think where the Street is debating upon is that historical seasonality, does it bake in some year-end budget flush or what is baked into that sequential step-up?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. So I think what we're seeing is that it's -- we normally see the step-up, that's what we're expecting this time. We're not including the budget flush in that. If we see a budget flush, it's on top and that will be in our Q1 numbers as we go forward.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Vijay, this is Bob and just to build-on what Padraig is saying, I mean you're absolutely right. When we look at the sequential, it is in-line with our historical in our order book based on what we've seen today. Obviously, we have to book orders in Q4, but our order book trends would support that.\nVijay Kumar: Fantastic. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nTycho Peterson: Hey, guys. Question on BIOVECTRA and maybe just synergies with the rest of the NASD business. How do you think about -- does that change views on capacity? And maybe just talk a little bit about how much of their BIOVECTRA business is clinical versus commercial and any kind of emerging modalities that you're adding here?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I'll start, Tycho and I'll bring in Simon in a minute. So we are absolutely delighted with BIOVECTRA. We think it's a great asset that enhances our offerings and it really allows us to deepen our relationships with our key pharma customers. And what we're really excited about is that it builds on our capabilities on the current NASD modalities around anti-sense and particularly gene editing with microbial fermentation and ADC capability. And so we're very happy with that. So there's a lot of synergies as we bring that forward. So I'll hand over to Simon to talk maybe about capacity in the main business.\nSimon May: Yes, I think Padraig hit many of the high notes already in terms of the synergies. We already mentioned the complete solution offering in gene editing, which we see as a really significant competitive advantage going forward. Sterile fill finish is another synergy that we're excited about. We've had a lot of request from our customers over the past few years for that capability. And from the diligence we've done with BIOVECTRA, we think they've got truly world-class capabilities there. And as Padraig also mentioned with microbial fermentation, high potency APIs, there's an existing footprint there in GLP-1 manufacturing. So I think we've got a slightly higher clinical mix in BIOVECTRA than we have in NASD. So I think we're just killing several birds with one stone with this acquisition. From a capacity perspective, I'd say BIOVECTRA has been ahead of the curve with capacity CapEx and we've got some skin to grow into there over the next few years\nTycho Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-up on China. You had the pull-forward dynamic in the first quarter, $15 million. If that were back in 2Q, I think you were effectively flat, maybe down a little bit. First, is that the right assumption? What are you actually embedding in 4Q for China in guidance? And then how do you think about the return to growth in 2025? Could you see that in the first half of the year?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Hey, Tycho, that's -- your recollection is correct. And as we think about implied fourth quarter down mid-single digits in China, we're going up quite honestly against some easier compares in-full disclosure. And we would expect a slight sequential step-up from a revenue perspective as well. And so that reflects this steady improvement. We do expect, again, not a lot of that stimulus to come in our Q4, basically none, but more into Q5, but the bidding activity that we're seeing has ramped-up. And then I think the activity that we're seeing in services and consumables, we're expecting that to continue. It's probably too early to tell next year for China, but I would expect it to continue to improve and not be down the way it is. We're expecting a low double-digit decline this year, we would expect to improve from that and it will probably be improvement throughout the year as opposed to an immediate improvement. Certainly, the stimulus will help us with that. But again, that will be in our first and second quarters most likely, but we're not expecting a huge step-up right there. It will be overtime because this stimulus is over a three-year period.\nTycho Peterson: Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nPuneet Souda: Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Instrumentation growth, obviously, an important question. You know, last quarter, you lowered expectations meaningfully, but again, book-to-bill was a strong more than one. Again, this quarter it is more than one and I think you said that, that last quarter was the first time you saw growth in the market after seven quarters. So that looks like it's continued again into the quarter. So just maybe help us understand instrument where we sit on instrumentation and what sort of recovery are you seeing here in August and what gives you sort of confidence that the instrumentation should bounce -- continue to bounce back into 2025 as well?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, look at the indications from the team, we have a strategic account team that does a lot of citations with our major accounts. There's -- we're seeing that more positive than negative in terms of customer sentiment, which is a very good sign. We see a lot of activity in our testing labs, as well as focusing on PFAS and so on. So there is drivers within the markets that are positive. But overall, I would say it's slow and steady and we're trading it as that. And the teams have really good visibility. Our commercial teams, which we've transformed in the last few years are really, really close to our customers. We have really good visibility into that. So it's slow, but steady. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob, to that?\nBob McMahon: Yes. No, I think you're spot-on and we're not building any budget flush into our Q4, Puneet. So if that does in fact happen, that would be a benefit to our current estimate.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. Thanks. And then recent drug pricing negotiation with Medicare on the first drugs are out. Obviously, IRA is having an impact, but over the next three years annually, 15 drugs will be negotiated and that probably leads to another set of impacts. So what are you hearing from your large pharma customers and overall, how are they thinking about the R&D spend and the spend that they're -- that they currently have on Agilent?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I think in general, they're very cautious, of course, with some of the impacts, the macro impacts that are facing. They're not -- there's a lot of M&A activity going on within pharma, a lot of consolidation, which of course takes time and energy for these companies to focus on. And I think what you're going to see overtime is it probably even out in terms of impact. What isn't going down, by the way, is the number of R&D programs. We see that increasing in a number of key modality areas, particularly around GLP-1, etc. So we need to wait and see, but having said that, people kind of forget in the last few years the enormous amount of spend that has happened and we're seeing that normalize now, of course in the installed-base and coming out of that in 2025.\nPuneet Souda: Okay, fair. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to follow-up on maybe this is what Puneet was just getting at, but you called out in your prepared remarks a couple of times that with biopharma, small molecule held up a little bit better or small molecule did a little bit better than large molecule, I assume. Just wondering if you could delve into that a little bit more, was that a particular instrument class or modality that drove that? Was that -- does that have to do with budget cycles, just what you're seeing there and why there's such a difference in molecule type?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Mike, this is Bob. You're right, I mean, our small molecule business was down mid-single digits in the quarter, which was better-than-expected actually. And then in Europe, it grew, which was a very positive sign. And this does speak to -- you can only hold-on to your old instruments for so long before the replacements need to happen. We're not calling replacement cycle inflection just yet, but every quarter these instruments get older. And one of the things that I think is important here is, pill counts and volumes continue to grow. And back to the question around the IRA and the pricing, I think it was generally, you know, not the worst case scenario, maybe a little better than people expected. And where our strength is, is in the development moving into production and that continues to be long-term positive trend. So that would be our core LC franchise and then the biopharma, some of that was impacted by our NASD business, which was kind of the air pocket. Actually, if you take our biopharma business, which was down double digits and you take NASD out, we are at mid-single digits as well. Not as -- it was down a little more than small molecule, but generally still in that same range. So both of them are actually when you take out the kind of the one-time unique aspect of NASD performing better quarter-on-quarter, which is a positive sign.\nPadraig McDonnell: So I would say, just adding to that, Bob, we saw services growing double-digits in biopharma and mid-single digits in small molecules. So that's a big component of what we see in those different modalities.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. Both of those answers really helpful. And then for my follow-up, I want to lean in a little bit more on BIOVECTRA. I mean, everything you kind of laid out there for the rationale and the financials of the deal certainly makes sense. But I'm just curious, you know, you've had a presence in some CDMO type capabilities in the past. Just wondering how hard are you going to lean into this? And what I'm alluding to is obviously, one of your large traditional tools vendors has a CDMO business has been in that business for a number of years now and there's a lot of talk of the benefits of having both the instrument, the consumables and the services business on the tail-end. Is this something you're going to continue to grow overtime? Is it BIOVECTRA like a beachhead acquisition? I mean we should expect more investment down the road?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I'll start and then maybe hand it over to Simon. When we look at our M&A ambition, first of all, we're -- it's going to be -- it's going to be really centered around where our strategy is, what's the strategic fit in faster-growing markets and of course, value creation. BIOVECTRA takes all of those boxes and it's an area of where we're building out more capabilities for customers. So we see that continuing. And so we're really excited about it, but we do see that this business has a lot of runway. It's a business that's growing well, very well-run, of course and has had a lot of capital investment over a number of years. And I think this is only the start of our ambition in continuing to grow BIOVECTRA and NASD. But Simon?\nSimon May: Not much to add really, only beyond that, we've got a very strong existing position in the RNA modality. I'd say up until this point, it's been a relatively narrow capability position and BIOVECTRA builds on that quite nicely as we look at future optionality around complementary capabilities and modalities, we think it's a rich space and that's probably all we can say at this point.\nMichael Ryskin: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just back to China, the down 11% was a bit better than we were looking for. Can you just unpack what specifically got better in the quarter given the guidance cut that you made last quarter, maybe either by customer type or by product type? And then just to clear up, like so your guidance for China, I know it was down double digit. Has that changed at all? Have you improved that? So that's my first question.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Dan. Thanks for the question. China is still in line with our full-year end guidance down low-double-digits. If I look at where we actually performed slightly better than what we anticipated, it was actually in pharma and it gets back to what we were talking about before, the activity both on the services side performing sequentially better, as well as our consumables business actually growing. And so we were down you know close to 30% in Q2 of last year, we were down low double-digits in pharma year-on-year. And so that was the big sequential improvement in Q3 and I would expect that to continue into Q4.\nDan Brennan: Okay. Thanks, Bob. And then sorry to go back to NASD, but there's just been a lot of questions from investors after the turn of events year-to-date in terms of that business really slowing a lot. Can you -- did you say what it did actually in the quarter? I didn't hear the number kind of year-over-year, what did NSD do in the quarter and then kind of if we take your guidance full-year, I know you said step-up, could you just give us some clarity on the quarter? And then any additional color on clinical versus commercial? It sounds like your bookings are improving, so that portends well for the outlook, but just trying to unpack like what's going on right now in the quarter? Thank you.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Hey, Dan. What I would say is, we typically don't give a specific number for NASD, but it actually performed in line or slightly better than what we expected. So we had been signaling a step down in Q3 and we actually did better than what we were expecting there. The full-year is still in line with where we were, which is roughly a $300 million business. As Simon was saying, the bookings continue to be positive in terms of activity and we're starting to see some of our customers, the readouts of some of the activities, which is more a harbinger of long-term opportunity versus short-term. But you know, if anything, it was a little better than we expected. So I don't want anyone to takeaway that it wasn't -- even though it was down in the quarter, we expected that and communicated that as part of our guidance and we're still on-track for the full-year estimate that we had coming into the quarter.\nDan Brennan: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey, guys, thanks for the questions. Maybe first, just could you talk about growth rates by segment for the fiscal fourth quarter and maybe your assumptions for instrumentation versus consumables and services in the fourth quarter?\nPadraig McDonnell: Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes, I'll -- hey, Catherine, it's Bob. What I would say is, if I look at our Q4, all groups, we would expect to do better and if I went by group, LSAG would be -- we're expecting kind of low single digits off of a down 7% this year. Consumables being better than that overall and with the instrument side, still probably down slightly or would be down slightly. DGD down mid-single digits and ACG up mid-single digits towards the high-end. That's what we've embedded in our guidance. So all three of those actually performing better than where we were in Q3.\nCatherine Schulte: Yes, perfect. And then maybe going back to Small Molecule, nice to see the improvement there. I think what was just Small Molecule performance excluding China? I know you said Europe grew, but just curious to get more color on what you're seeing elsewhere?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I think what we're seeing is Europe was a standout in Small Molecule, a lot of activity there, but probably stable across the different markets on us. And what we did see from the Small Molecule side, we did see pretty good growth in services that as well as has had that number, but I think overall Europe ahead, but everywhere else stable.\nBob McMahon: Yes. What -- and so we were down mid-single digits and as Padraig said, if you took China out, we were down low-single digits everywhere else.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Waldman: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for you. Padraig or Bob, maybe first a follow-up. On your assumption for no budget flushing impact on pharma instrumentation, is that just a function of the timing of your quarter relative to calendar year-end buying from these customers? Or are there other things you're seeing that are leaving you on the sidelines as it relates to end of your pharma spending? And then a related question was, curious any high-level thoughts you had on 2025 based on planning conversations you're having with pharma accounts, are you thinking next year should be a return to normal growth type year in pharma instrument budget as budgets are reset or is it more of a gradual recovery or return to normal over a couple of year period. Any feedback you're getting from accounts on that?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I'll take the first one and maybe hand-off to Bob for the second one. I think it's a year ago and we were -- people were talking about budget flushes. We didn't expect it and we didn't see it. We saw a little bit, but not much. We're expecting the same this time, of course, our year-end at the end of October. So if we do see any activity will be in Q1 2025. Why do we see this is because we're very close to our customers. We know exactly when, where the funnel is, where the deals are and where installed base, we have a lot of installed base information. So we're not expecting it anything substantial at the end-of-the year. But what we are seeing is a lot more conversations about next year, slow, steady recovery and we're hearing that across the board. I don't know if you want to take the second question, Bob?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Josh, on 2025 as we were saying, it's probably too early to say. But what I -- our current indication is that it's not going to snap back November 1st to be back to normal. I do think that you'll continue to see a recovery throughout FY 2025 and get back to that long-term growth rate sometime in 2025, that's the way we kind of think about it. But I don't think it's another two to three year estimate either or based on our conversations with our customers right now. So it's probably in between.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Okay. And then just had a follow-up on ACG. I was curious if you could provide a bit more context on the dynamics you're seeing there, especially interested in what you're seeing from an RFP and win rate dynamic in the contracted business? And then you mentioned, I think in the slide decks, benefiting from mix. I was wondering if you could flush that out a bit?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I'll take the first part of that question and hand it over to Angelica. Extremely pleased with ACG's performance and that's years of investment in a broad product offerings in key markets, that are really being received by customers in this environment where they want to get more productivity out of their systems, they want to use their assets in different ways. And we've seen the flow through to our results in spite of the CapEx challenges all year. So the business performs extremely well and the margins are extremely good. So I'll ask Angelica to provide more color on the contract business. But I think what's really interesting is our enterprise service business as well. Angelica?\nAngelica Riemann: Yes, so to really dive in on the contracts, right? It's nearly 70% of our business in Q3 and it's continuing to grow double-digit. As we continue to see that strong demand in our enterprise service offerings, which are in the high -- the mid-teens, it's really about being there to help customers optimize their lab operations, improve their productivity and our offers really facilitate our customers improving the lab operations, the efficiencies and the waste reduction. So we're continuing to see some very strong and sticky behavior within our contracts franchise.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And Josh, just on the comment on mix is, when we have business on-contract, that generally is good for us and good for our customers as well.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Okay. Appreciate all the detail.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDoug Schenkel: Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. I know it's late in the call, that being said, I got three lightning round questions, which I'm going to rattle through and then listen to the answers. The first is on math. If recurring revenue growth was up mid-single digits in the quarter, it seems like instruments has to be down around 20%, maybe more based on the numbers you reported in the 10-Q in Q3 of last year. Bob, I think you said in response to Matt Sykes' question, it was down low-double digits. What are we missing? Just not trying to be too picky here, but it just seems important in the context of assessing trends and what way to put on your book-to-bill commentary. So that's the first question. The second is on China stimulus. Any change in dynamics regarding stalling either in terms of conversions or even cancellations? There's some skeletal that that there's been some recent changes as the shape of stimulus becomes a bit more clear? And then the third question is on 2025. If you exit 2024 with flattish core growth in Q4, that would obviously be a positive trend relative to what we've seen over the last few quarters. That said, it would seem like if you draw a straight line that you'd be on track to exit 2025 at around, call it 5%, maybe 6% growth rather than growing mid-single digits for the year. So I think you need a fundamental improvement in overall market conditions and/or a real impact from China stimulus to get to mid-singles for the year. I just want to see if any of my logic is flawed there? Thank you and have a good night.\nPadraig McDonnell: That's certainly a lightning round, Doug, but we'll try and we'll answer it. I think, Bob, you can take the first and the last one, I'll take China.\nBob McMahon: Yes. The comment that I had on Instruments was specifically related to LSAG instruments and they were down low double-digit. Consumables was up mid-single digits for the total being down minus 7%. So that is. We do have some instrumentation in DGG as well that was down roughly the same as where LSAG was. So down 20% is way too negative. I'll turn it over to Padraig for the second one and then I can jump back into last one.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I think, we're very close to our China team and the local team has seen an increased activity. We're seeing that improve from last quarter and for clarity, of course, we're not building any benefit from the stimulus into our Q4 guide. But what we're seeing is, we're seeing in early days, what we're hearing that the stimulus is broader in terms of its reach over a three-year period. Having said that, we are hearing that the first tranche will likely be focused on Academic & Government accounts. But again, it's early days, as it trickles down through provinces, as the mechanism of the funding goes, we'll be sure to update as we know that.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And I think just the last one real quick. It's too early. We're not going to get into what we're looking at for FY 2025 other than to say that we expect improvement throughout the year.\nOperator: And I'll now turn the call back over to Parmeet Ahuja for any closing remarks.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Regina and thanks everyone for joining the call today. With that, we'd like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Padraig McDonnell",
            "content": "Thanks, Parmeet. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining today's call. The Agilent team executed well in the third quarter and posted solid results, delivering better-than-expected revenue and earnings. Revenue of $1.578 billion, declined 4.4%, an improvement of 300 basis points from Q2, reflecting the steady improvement in the market. Operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially, as the actions we announced last quarter start to deliver. And we remain on-track to deliver the incremental annualized savings of $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. Earnings per share of $1.32 is $0.04 above the high end of guidance. As a result of our strong Q3 performance, we are raising our guidance at the midpoint for both revenue and EPS and we continue to make investments in our most promising growth opportunities that I referenced in our Q2 call. We are investing in our digital ecosystem to further enhance our differentiated customer experience, plus we are mobilizing the organization to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives, driving margin expansion and growth and increasing our execution capabilities. Separately in the quarter, we were excited to announce two acquisitions that demonstrate our focus on biopharma and our digital ecosystem, which I'll talk about in a moment. As you know well, the pace of change is faster than ever. Our markets, customers and competitors are not standing still, neither are we. We are accelerating our pace of innovation and execution, so we can add to and capitalize on opportunities in front of us. We are sharply focused on key growth vectors, including biopharma, PFAS and Advanced Materials. I continue to meet and connect with employees, customers and shareholders around the globe to listen to their perspectives on how we should build on our strengths and move Agilent forward. The entire Agilent team is clear on what is vital to the company's future, becoming even more customer focused and even more nimble to continue to win in the marketplace and add value to customers and shareholders. We are evolving our strategy, adapting quickly to market trends and changes, while accelerating our pace of innovation in areas of greatest return for long-term growth. We're excited to announce that you'll hear more about these topics and our transformation at our Investor Day we have planned in New York on December 17th. Now, let's talk further about our Q3 results. All our end markets except academia and government, which is our smallest, ended the quarter better-than-expected. Our largest market pharma declined high-single-digits, slightly better than our expectations and while biopharma continues to be pressured, we are seeing relatively better performance in small molecule. Our leadership in providing workflow solutions for PFAS continued to show strong performance in the environmental markets. Geographically, Europe exceeded expectations led by small-molecule pharma, as well as continued strength in environmental. Our other regions performed roughly in-line with expectations. While capital equipment budgets remain constrained, we continue to see good lab activity in Q3 with services plus consumables growing mid-single digits. When looking at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $782 million in revenue, down 7%, while the instrument side of the business remains constrained, it was encouraging that our instrument book-to-bill was again greater than one. The group saw a decline across all regions and most end-markets with low single-digit growth in Environmental & Forensics. The Consumables continue to be a bright spot, growing by mid-single digit. The LSAG team also was busy innovating with the introduction of the 8850 GC that helps customers reach their sustainability goals by delivering answers efficiently, while using up to 30% less power than other GC's and has a much smaller footprint. Moving on to the Agilent CrossLab Group, the business delivered revenue of $411 million for the quarter, up mid-single digit. ACG grew in every region except China, where we were down modestly year-on-year, but showed meaningful improvement versus last quarter. Once again, we drove double-digit growth in service contracts, which represented nearly 70% of the total business. And beyond another quarter of solid revenue growth, ACG also delivered a record operating margin of 34%, demonstrating that the resiliency and strength of the recurring revenue business continues despite the constrained capital equipment environment. The continued strength of our business is a testament to our strategy of increasing the connect rates on our instruments and the ongoing value we are providing to our customers in helping them reach their productivity goals. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $385 million in revenue, representing an 8% decline. Pathology grew mid-single digits globally and was offset by declines in Cell Analysis, NASD and genomics. NASD stepped down sequentially in Q3 as expected and we are on track for NASD's revenues to step-up sequentially in Q4. In the face of a constrained CapEx environment, the Agilent team has remained consistent in putting our customers first and fostering deeper relationships with them. We continue to execute well and be disciplined, while investing in high-growth opportunities. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to announce two acquisitions, that speak to our focus on biopharma and increasing recurring revenue, as well as on strengthening the digital ecosystem for Agilent customers. In late July, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire BIOVECTRA, a leading specialized contract development and manufacturing organization. The Canada-based company builds on Agilent's capabilities in oligonucleotides and CRISPR therapeutics by expanding our portfolio of services. BIOVECTRA adds rapidly growing modalities in microbial fermentation, antibody-drug conjugates and high-potency active pharmaceutical ingredients. It also brings world-class capabilities that when combined with NASD enables us to deliver customers a complete gene editing solution. The company delivered more than $110 million in revenue during the calendar year 2023 and expects double-digit revenue growth this year. The BIOVECTRA acquisition remains on-track to be closed by the end of the year and we're looking-forward to welcoming the BIOVECTRA team to Agilent. At the end of the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of California-based Sigsense, a start-up that uses artificial intelligence and power monitoring to help customers optimize their lab operations. Sigsense Technology already is available to our customers through CrossLab Connect, a suite of digital applications that improve lab performance. A hearty welcome to the Sigsense team who already is part of Agilent. During the quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which showcases a large and growing portfolio of products that help our customers reach their sustainability goals. Instruments certified with the My GreenLab ACT label now accounts for 40% of all instrument revenue and we continue to regularly release products like the new 8850 GC with environmental benefits. We are also proud that we have recently ranked in the top 20 of Time Magazine's 500 Most Sustainable companies in the world. Bob will now provide the details on our results, as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob. These are exciting times at Agilent, with a team that is second to known, we are doubling down on our customer force culture and deepening our relationships to further enhance our market leading customer experience that is already the best in the industry. We are evolving our strategy to aggressively pursue our ambition to grow in markets where we have a right to win through both organic and inorganic growth and we will continue to accelerate value creation through strategic transformation initiatives. We remain a leader across key platforms and we're in great long-term growth markets that are beginning to show evidence of recovery. And best of all, our team is engaged, leading to Newsweek including Agilent on its America's Greatest Workplaces 2024 list. Again, thank you for joining today's call. I'm energized by how we are evolving Agilent. Each data team gains momentum in building an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers and creates value for our shareholders. We are fueled by the future possibilities and I look forward to continuing to share our progress. Parmeet, over to you for Q&A. Yes. Thanks a lot, Matt, maybe I'll kick it off and give it to Bob. I think, first of all, you're correct, we saw very, very promising growth in both Consumables & Services, which shows lab activity is actually improving or is very stable. We're still very challenged on the instrument side, but what we're seeing is, we're seeing a lot of activity around conversations with lab managers. Our funnel is extremely stable. We haven't seen any -- any cancellations. But what I would say is that, deal closure times are still elevated. So we're not at this point seeing any budget towards the end of the year and which of course for us ends at the end of October, but we're watching that closely. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob? No, I think, look, we saw a decline of about 11% and that was really against the comparative feature, the stimulus in EMEA and strong results in APAC and China. And so it was a really tough compare. And I think what we're seeing is funding remains stable in most regions and except I would say Europe where we're seeing a reallocation of funding towards defense, but I would say no major changes in that market. Yes. Look, I'll start off and maybe I'll hand it over to Simon, who is on the call here as well. We've seen, with clinical batches, of course, there can be changes with customers progress in those batches. We're not seeing any changes in what we're saying for Q4, so we're fairly certain of Q4 on that. What we're seeing as well is that we've grown our clinical business over 50% this year, which is very promising. The long range view of the market is very strong with the drugs and the modalities that are being used. But I think what you're seeing is a normal kind of up and down between quarters with that business. But I don't know if you want to add any more color, Simon? Yes, Patrick. It's a great question and we had actually seen a little of that in our Q2 of last -- just a quarter ago here really on the bid activity, primarily for instrumentation. We are optimistic about the mid-term here in terms of the stimulus. That's probably more FY 2025 event probably. But what we are seeing is more activity there and I think what's encouraging and maybe I can turn it over to Angelica as well, our services business has seen an increase in a pickup in activity and certainly we saw consumables as well. So it still dampened demand and we did see that impact in Academia & Government, that was the biggest impact in China, but we are seeing some pockets of green shoot in terms of recovery. Yes, I mean in general terms, Jack, I think you know the customers are very, very cautious. But what I will say is that lab manager remain very engaged with our sales teams about future projects, that is true. We see a lot of stability in that. So it's still very challenged and I would say that, you know our deal close rate is still elevated, but our funnels are very stable with low cancellations. So I think that goes across most of the markets. And as you see going-forward, you know our results in CST and services growing mid-single digits and bodes very, very well in terms of lab activity increasing. So we're seeing slow, but steady improvement. I would say if you looked at the LC and LCMS business, they were in the mid-teens, our spectroscopy business better than that. Yes. So, you're correct, it was declined by 5% and it was really due to the impact of overproduction in China, which negatively impacted market investments globally. But we did see increases in service and consumables, both combined at 7% increase, but there was a decrease of about 14% in instruments and I think CapEx spending remains slightly challenged there. Yes, Vijay, thanks for the question. I think in terms of what we expect getting better, we expect all of them to improve next year. We raised the midpoint of guidance, $15 million on revenue and $0.03 in EPS and we see across all those areas, markets improving slowly and that's reflected in the sequential increase that we're guiding in Q4. So while we had a kind of a solid Q3, the end market environment for capital remains constrained and visibility while improving is still difficult. Yes. So I think what we're seeing is that it's -- we normally see the step-up, that's what we're expecting this time. We're not including the budget flush in that. If we see a budget flush, it's on top and that will be in our Q1 numbers as we go forward. Yes. I'll start, Tycho and I'll bring in Simon in a minute. So we are absolutely delighted with BIOVECTRA. We think it's a great asset that enhances our offerings and it really allows us to deepen our relationships with our key pharma customers. And what we're really excited about is that it builds on our capabilities on the current NASD modalities around anti-sense and particularly gene editing with microbial fermentation and ADC capability. And so we're very happy with that. So there's a lot of synergies as we bring that forward. So I'll hand over to Simon to talk maybe about capacity in the main business. Yes. Hey, Tycho, that's -- your recollection is correct. And as we think about implied fourth quarter down mid-single digits in China, we're going up quite honestly against some easier compares in-full disclosure. And we would expect a slight sequential step-up from a revenue perspective as well. And so that reflects this steady improvement. We do expect, again, not a lot of that stimulus to come in our Q4, basically none, but more into Q5, but the bidding activity that we're seeing has ramped-up. And then I think the activity that we're seeing in services and consumables, we're expecting that to continue. It's probably too early to tell next year for China, but I would expect it to continue to improve and not be down the way it is. We're expecting a low double-digit decline this year, we would expect to improve from that and it will probably be improvement throughout the year as opposed to an immediate improvement. Certainly, the stimulus will help us with that. But again, that will be in our first and second quarters most likely, but we're not expecting a huge step-up right there. It will be overtime because this stimulus is over a three-year period. Yes, look at the indications from the team, we have a strategic account team that does a lot of citations with our major accounts. There's -- we're seeing that more positive than negative in terms of customer sentiment, which is a very good sign. We see a lot of activity in our testing labs, as well as focusing on PFAS and so on. So there is drivers within the markets that are positive. But overall, I would say it's slow and steady and we're trading it as that. And the teams have really good visibility. Our commercial teams, which we've transformed in the last few years are really, really close to our customers. We have really good visibility into that. So it's slow, but steady. I don't know if you want to add anything, Bob, to that? Yes. Look, I think in general, they're very cautious, of course, with some of the impacts, the macro impacts that are facing. They're not -- there's a lot of M&A activity going on within pharma, a lot of consolidation, which of course takes time and energy for these companies to focus on. And I think what you're going to see overtime is it probably even out in terms of impact. What isn't going down, by the way, is the number of R&D programs. We see that increasing in a number of key modality areas, particularly around GLP-1, etc. So we need to wait and see, but having said that, people kind of forget in the last few years the enormous amount of spend that has happened and we're seeing that normalize now, of course in the installed-base and coming out of that in 2025. So I would say, just adding to that, Bob, we saw services growing double-digits in biopharma and mid-single digits in small molecules. So that's a big component of what we see in those different modalities. Yes, I'll start and then maybe hand it over to Simon. When we look at our M&A ambition, first of all, we're -- it's going to be -- it's going to be really centered around where our strategy is, what's the strategic fit in faster-growing markets and of course, value creation. BIOVECTRA takes all of those boxes and it's an area of where we're building out more capabilities for customers. So we see that continuing. And so we're really excited about it, but we do see that this business has a lot of runway. It's a business that's growing well, very well-run, of course and has had a lot of capital investment over a number of years. And I think this is only the start of our ambition in continuing to grow BIOVECTRA and NASD. But Simon? Bob? Yes, I think what we're seeing is Europe was a standout in Small Molecule, a lot of activity there, but probably stable across the different markets on us. And what we did see from the Small Molecule side, we did see pretty good growth in services that as well as has had that number, but I think overall Europe ahead, but everywhere else stable. Yes, I'll take the first one and maybe hand-off to Bob for the second one. I think it's a year ago and we were -- people were talking about budget flushes. We didn't expect it and we didn't see it. We saw a little bit, but not much. We're expecting the same this time, of course, our year-end at the end of October. So if we do see any activity will be in Q1 2025. Why do we see this is because we're very close to our customers. We know exactly when, where the funnel is, where the deals are and where installed base, we have a lot of installed base information. So we're not expecting it anything substantial at the end-of-the year. But what we are seeing is a lot more conversations about next year, slow, steady recovery and we're hearing that across the board. I don't know if you want to take the second question, Bob? Yes, I'll take the first part of that question and hand it over to Angelica. Extremely pleased with ACG's performance and that's years of investment in a broad product offerings in key markets, that are really being received by customers in this environment where they want to get more productivity out of their systems, they want to use their assets in different ways. And we've seen the flow through to our results in spite of the CapEx challenges all year. So the business performs extremely well and the margins are extremely good. So I'll ask Angelica to provide more color on the contract business. But I think what's really interesting is our enterprise service business as well. Angelica? That's certainly a lightning round, Doug, but we'll try and we'll answer it. I think, Bob, you can take the first and the last one, I'll take China. Yes. Look, I think, we're very close to our China team and the local team has seen an increased activity. We're seeing that improve from last quarter and for clarity, of course, we're not building any benefit from the stimulus into our Q4 guide. But what we're seeing is, we're seeing in early days, what we're hearing that the stimulus is broader in terms of its reach over a three-year period. Having said that, we are hearing that the first tranche will likely be focused on Academic & Government accounts. But again, it's early days, as it trickles down through provinces, as the mechanism of the funding goes, we'll be sure to update as we know that."

            "name": "Angelica Riemann",
            "content": "Yes, Bob, I'll just add. In China, we are encouraged from a services perspective on the nice sequential growth that we saw from Q2 to Q3, which is indicative of continued and somewhat increasing lab activity in China. Yes, so to really dive in on the contracts, right? It's nearly 70% of our business in Q3 and it's continuing to grow double-digit. As we continue to see that strong demand in our enterprise service offerings, which are in the high -- the mid-teens, it's really about being there to help customers optimize their lab operations, improve their productivity and our offers really facilitate our customers improving the lab operations, the efficiencies and the waste reduction. So we're continuing to see some very strong and sticky behavior within our contracts franchise."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Simon May",
            "content": "Yes, I'd just echo what Padraig said, I think the Q3 performance that we saw in NASD was largely in line with expectations. And in that business, we always see a natural lag between order booking activity and revenue recognition because of the length of time that these programs take. And towards the end of last year, we were really seeing the effects of the IRA impacts and that's still not completely waned, but what we saw in Q3 was pretty strong bookings activity. So as we look to Q4 and into 2025, I think we're cautiously optimistic about seeing a return to growth there. So I'd really just characterize Q3 as in line with expectations and part and parcel of the lumpiness you see in this business. You also mentioned Helios, I think it's just worth mentioning that we were very happy to see that development, but still very early days in terms of how that's going to ramp up and play out and too soon to say where that's concerned. There's certainly no impact in the remainder of 2024 and unlikely in 2025 as well. Yes, I think Padraig hit many of the high notes already in terms of the synergies. We already mentioned the complete solution offering in gene editing, which we see as a really significant competitive advantage going forward. Sterile fill finish is another synergy that we're excited about. We've had a lot of request from our customers over the past few years for that capability. And from the diligence we've done with BIOVECTRA, we think they've got truly world-class capabilities there. And as Padraig also mentioned with microbial fermentation, high potency APIs, there's an existing footprint there in GLP-1 manufacturing. So I think we've got a slightly higher clinical mix in BIOVECTRA than we have in NASD. So I think we're just killing several birds with one stone with this acquisition. From a capacity perspective, I'd say BIOVECTRA has been ahead of the curve with capacity CapEx and we've got some skin to grow into there over the next few years Not much to add really, only beyond that, we've got a very strong existing position in the RNA modality. I'd say up until this point, it's been a relatively narrow capability position and BIOVECTRA builds on that quite nicely as we look at future optionality around complementary capabilities and modalities, we think it's a rich space and that's probably all we can say at this point."

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Padraig and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full-year and fourth quarter guidance. Q3 revenue was $1.578 billion, a decline of 4.4% core, but a 300 basis-point sequential improvement as Padraig noted. Excluding China, revenue declined low-single digits in the quarter. On a reported basis, currency had a negative impact of 1.1 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 10 basis points, resulting in a reported decline of 5.6%. Our largest end market pharma declined 8%. Biopharma was down low double-digits or down mid-single digits, excluding NASD. Small molecule performed better, down mid-single digits and was led by growth in Europe. Services and pharma continues to perform well, growing high single-digit. In Chemical & Advanced Materials, revenue declined 5%, with growth in Americas offset by softness in China. Our Advanced Materials sub-segment performed better, driven by our business in the semiconductor market. Academia and government, our smallest market, can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. We saw a decline of 11% as Europe and China both saw double-digit declines, partially offset by better performance in the Americas region. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical end-market grew 2%, including continued mid-single digit growth in pathology, offset by ongoing softness in genomics. In Environmental & Forensics, we grew 4%, another great quarter for our PFAS testing business. We saw robust business in Europe, led by the new EU Water Directive and in China due to the nationwide emerging pollutants program. Now wrapping up our end-markets, food was down 3% versus last year, but grew sequentially and was led by Asia, ex-China. Moving on to our regional performance, Europe was flat overall, beating our expectations, while we declined 6% in the Americas and declined 1% in Asia, ex-China. China revenue declined 11% with quarterly revenue improving sequentially, driven by growth in services and consumables. This speaks to some increase in lab activity, which is encouraging. Now, let's move on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 56.0% in the quarter, down slightly versus a year-ago, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Our operating margin of 27.4% improved sequentially and was better-than-expected. Despite the dampened demand, we continue to make good progress in driving our productivity initiatives and continuing to manage the cost structure very well, while investing for growth. As Padraig mentioned, we are on track to deliver the $100 million in incremental annualized cost-savings by the end of the fiscal year. Below the line, our net interest income was in line as was our tax rate of 13% and we had $291 million diluted shares outstanding in the quarter. Putting it all together, Q3 earnings per share were $1.32. That was ahead of our expectations, but down 7.7% from a year ago as we went up against a difficult compare due to the variable pay reset in Q3 of last year. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continue to enjoy a very strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Operating cash flow was $452 million in the quarter and we invested $92 million in capital expenditures. As we committed in Q2, we ramped-up our share repurchases starting here in Q3. We purchased $585 million in shares and paid out $68 million through dividends, for a total of $653 million returned to shareholders in the quarter. This includes $500 million of the previously announced $750 million opportunistic share repurchase and we expect to complete the additional $250 million repurchase in Q4. We ended the quarter with a net leverage ratio of $0.6 and even with the upcoming BIOVECTRA acquisition, our balance sheet and leverage ratios will still be in a very strong position. In summary, we performed well and continue to see a steady improvement in the market and expect that to continue into FY 2025. Because of our Q3 results, we are increasing the midpoint of our revenue and earnings per share guidance for the year. We now expect full-year revenue to be in the range of $6.450 billion to $6.500 billion. This represents a decline of 5.6% to 4.9% on a reported basis and a decline of 5.0% to 4.3% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 60 basis points. Full-year non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $5.21 and $5.25, representing a decline of 4.2% to 3.5%. This assumes net interest income of $38 million, a 13% tax rate and $292 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We have not included any impact of the BIOVECTRA acquisition in our updated guidance and $0.06 does not have a material financial impact to the year or Q4. This full-year guidance translates into Q4 revenue in the range of $1.641 billion to $1.691 billion. This represents a decline of 1.9% to 1.1% growth on a core basis and a decline of 2.8% to 0.2% growth on a reported basis. Currency and M&A are a combined headwind of 90 basis-points. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.38 and $1.42, marking a return to growth at the midpoint. We expect a 13% tax rate, a decrease in net interest income to $5 million due to the lower cash balance and $287 million diluted shares outstanding for the quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Padraig for some closing comments. Padraig? Yes. Thanks, Matt, for that question and maybe just to fill in and add some additional commentary to what Padraig was saying. When we looked at the quarter, we were very pleased actually both our Consumables business, as well as our Instrument business performed better-than-expected in the quarter. We were down 7% in total. Our Consumables business was actually up mid-single digits towards the high-end there. And our Instruments business was down low-double-digits, but that was better than what we expected. And as Padraig mentioned, we had a book-to-bill that was greater than one on the instrument side again this quarter, which was very encouraging. Yes. Hey, Rachel, this is Bob. Just to add-on a little more to answer your last part of your question in terms of the sequential step-up where we had talked -- as Simon and Padraig had said, we've done a little better actually in Q3 than we expected and we're expecting a roughly $20 million step-up from Q3 to Q4. Those orders are all in-house and we're still on-track for the long -- the full-year estimate for NASD and that's incorporated into our guidance. Yes, you were reading my mind, Rachel. This is Bob and it is a little too early to talk about FY 2025. But I think what it does show is our expectation of this continued steady improvement. We improved here in Q3, 300 basis-points sequentially. We're expecting another improvement here going into Q4. And I would expect that improvement to continue into FY 2025. So -- and we do expect -- while it's too early to give you a specific number, we do expect to grow next year. These markets will return and we've been below the long-term trend, but there's nothing to suggest that the or the long-term growth rates of these markets, there's nothing to suggest that these markets have changed and so we're optimistic about continued recovery going into FY 2025. Yes, I think as we talked about, Patrick, it's a great question and we're committed to continuing to drive efficiencies across all of the P&L line items and I think you've seen that across the actions that we've taken. We're on track to delivering that $100 million of incremental annualized savings by the end of 2024. So there will still be a tailwind, obviously going into 2025 for that benefit. Offsetting that will be some resets of our variable pay and activities like that, but we are committed to covering that. If I think about it at the highest level, what I would expect us to continue to be able to do is drive leveraged earnings next year. And I think you're seeing that the scale benefit that we're seeing in certainly our ACG business here this last quarter, just phenomenal profit contribution and I think with volume coming back into the instrument business as well, that will set us up nicely for next year. So think about a nice incremental tailwind associated with the continued actions or the annualization of that actions that come in FY 2025, partially offset by merit in some of the activities and then we'll have our ongoing productivity measures and some -- we'll actually share some of the more detail around this probably in our Analyst Day in December. So stay-tuned on that as well. Yes. Hey, Jack, just to follow-on to that. I think one of the things as we mentioned in the call, the book-to-bill being at one for instruments is a positive sign. It was slightly better than what we expected. Overall, LSAG instruments were down low-double-digit. Yes. Hey, Vijay, this is Bob and just to build-on what Padraig is saying, I mean you're absolutely right. When we look at the sequential, it is in-line with our historical in our order book based on what we've seen today. Obviously, we have to book orders in Q4, but our order book trends would support that. Yes. No, I think you're spot-on and we're not building any budget flush into our Q4, Puneet. So if that does in fact happen, that would be a benefit to our current estimate. Yes. Hey, Mike, this is Bob. You're right, I mean, our small molecule business was down mid-single digits in the quarter, which was better-than-expected actually. And then in Europe, it grew, which was a very positive sign. And this does speak to -- you can only hold-on to your old instruments for so long before the replacements need to happen. We're not calling replacement cycle inflection just yet, but every quarter these instruments get older. And one of the things that I think is important here is, pill counts and volumes continue to grow. And back to the question around the IRA and the pricing, I think it was generally, you know, not the worst case scenario, maybe a little better than people expected. And where our strength is, is in the development moving into production and that continues to be long-term positive trend. So that would be our core LC franchise and then the biopharma, some of that was impacted by our NASD business, which was kind of the air pocket. Actually, if you take our biopharma business, which was down double digits and you take NASD out, we are at mid-single digits as well. Not as -- it was down a little more than small molecule, but generally still in that same range. So both of them are actually when you take out the kind of the one-time unique aspect of NASD performing better quarter-on-quarter, which is a positive sign. Yes. Hey, Dan. Thanks for the question. China is still in line with our full-year end guidance down low-double-digits. If I look at where we actually performed slightly better than what we anticipated, it was actually in pharma and it gets back to what we were talking about before, the activity both on the services side performing sequentially better, as well as our consumables business actually growing. And so we were down you know close to 30% in Q2 of last year, we were down low double-digits in pharma year-on-year. And so that was the big sequential improvement in Q3 and I would expect that to continue into Q4. Yes. Hey, Dan. What I would say is, we typically don't give a specific number for NASD, but it actually performed in line or slightly better than what we expected. So we had been signaling a step down in Q3 and we actually did better than what we were expecting there. The full-year is still in line with where we were, which is roughly a $300 million business. As Simon was saying, the bookings continue to be positive in terms of activity and we're starting to see some of our customers, the readouts of some of the activities, which is more a harbinger of long-term opportunity versus short-term. But you know, if anything, it was a little better than we expected. So I don't want anyone to takeaway that it wasn't -- even though it was down in the quarter, we expected that and communicated that as part of our guidance and we're still on-track for the full-year estimate that we had coming into the quarter. Yes, I'll -- hey, Catherine, it's Bob. What I would say is, if I look at our Q4, all groups, we would expect to do better and if I went by group, LSAG would be -- we're expecting kind of low single digits off of a down 7% this year. Consumables being better than that overall and with the instrument side, still probably down slightly or would be down slightly. DGD down mid-single digits and ACG up mid-single digits towards the high-end. That's what we've embedded in our guidance. So all three of those actually performing better than where we were in Q3. Yes. What -- and so we were down mid-single digits and as Padraig said, if you took China out, we were down low-single digits everywhere else. Yes. Josh, on 2025 as we were saying, it's probably too early to say. But what I -- our current indication is that it's not going to snap back November 1st to be back to normal. I do think that you'll continue to see a recovery throughout FY 2025 and get back to that long-term growth rate sometime in 2025, that's the way we kind of think about it. But I don't think it's another two to three year estimate either or based on our conversations with our customers right now. So it's probably in between. Yes. And Josh, just on the comment on mix is, when we have business on-contract, that generally is good for us and good for our customers as well. Yes. The comment that I had on Instruments was specifically related to LSAG instruments and they were down low double-digit. Consumables was up mid-single digits for the total being down minus 7%. So that is. We do have some instrumentation in DGG as well that was down roughly the same as where LSAG was. So down 20% is way too negative. I'll turn it over to Padraig for the second one and then I can jump back into last one. Yes. And I think just the last one real quick. It's too early. We're not going to get into what we're looking at for FY 2025 other than to say that we expect improvement throughout the year."

I will now hand you over to your host, Parmeet Ahuja, to begin. Please go ahead.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Agilent's conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. With me are Padraig McDonnell, Agilent President and CEO; and Bob McMahon, Agilent's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A will be Phil Binns, President of the Agilent Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group; Simon May, our newly named President of the Agilent Diagnostics and Genomics Group; and Angelica Riemann, President of the Agilent CrossLab Group. This presentation is being webcast live. The news release for our second quarter financial results, investor presentation and information to supplement today's discussion along with the recording of this webcast are available on our website at www.investor.agilent.com. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. Unless otherwise noted, all references to increases or decreases in financial metrics are year-over-year and references to revenue growth are on a core basis. Core revenue growth excludes the impact of currency and any acquisitions and divestitures completed within the past 12 months. Guidance is based on forecasted exchange rates. As previously announced, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we implemented certain changes to our segment reporting structure related to the move of our cell analysis business from LSAG into DGG. We have recast our historical segment information to reflect these changes. These changes have no impact on our company's consolidated financial statements. During this call, we will also make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The Company assumes no obligation to update them. Please look at the Company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: Thanks, Parmeet. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I want to begin by saying I'm incredibly honored to serve as CEO of this great company, and I'm thankful for the opportunity to lead such a talented team. I truly believe the Agilent team is second to none, and I'm energized about the future possibilities that lie ahead of us. I also want to take this time to welcome our new DGG President, Simon May to the Agilent team. Simon's diversified experience, strong technical skills and growth mindset will be a key asset in this role. Since starting earlier this month, Simon has hit the ground running, and I am really looking forward to him helping move DGG and Agilent forward. Before I talk about the quarterly results, I'd like to tell you how I spent my time since the announcement in February that I will become Agilent's CEO. I've been meeting and connecting with employees, customers and shareholders around the world to listen to their perspectives and how we should build on our strengths and evolve Agilent. What they have told me is clear, Agilent must become even more customer focused and even more nimble to continue to win in the marketplace and add value to customers and shareholders. This has really resonated with our employees and customers. As an energized Agilent team, we will evolve our strategy, adapting quickly to market trends and changes while accelerating our pace of innovation in areas of greatest return for long-term growth. We will double down on our customer first culture, deepening our relationship to further enhance our market-leading customer experience that is already the best in the industry. Now let's talk about the Q2 results and outlook moving forward. In a challenging market environment, the Agilent team delivered on expectations. In the second quarter, we reported revenue of $1.573 billion, a 7.4% decline. This was against a tough compare of 9.5% growth in Q2 of last year. While revenues declined in the quarter, our book-to-bill was greater than one, and orders grew year-over-year for the first time in seven quarters. Earnings per share of $1.22 beat our expectations and represented a 4% decline from the second quarter of 2023. Now looking forward, the market environment continues to be challenging, but we are seeing early signs of recovery. However, as we announced in our press release, this market recovery is not at the pace we anticipated when we provided guidance earlier in the year. As a result, we are reducing our market growth expectations and revising our full year core revenue to be in the range of $6.42 billion to $6.5 billion and growth to decline between 4.3% and 5.4%. We now expect earnings per share to be between $5.15 and $5.25 for the year. We have responded quickly to the lower market growth expectations and are taking difficult, but necessary actions to streamline our cost structure. These actions will allow us to invest in our most promising growth opportunities while also delivering incremental annualized savings of $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. We are sharpening our focus on key growth vectors such as Biopharma, PFAS and Advanced Materials, while also investing in our digital ecosystem, and accelerating our innovation to drive even faster execution. And we are leveraging our strong balance sheet and plan to repurchase $750 million of our common stock across the third and four quarters, over and above our normal anti-dilutive repurchases. Bob will provide more details on our results and latest outlook in his remarks. Getting back to Q2 results. As expected, all end markets saw a declining revenue in Q2. Geographically, the Americas and Europe came in slightly ahead of expectations, while China lagged. Despite the challenging market conditions, our Agilent team stay close to our customers and continue to leverage our strong relationships with them to execute remarkably well while maintaining strong cost discipline. When we look at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $754 million in revenue, down 13%. The group saw a decline across all end markets and regions, with consumables being a bright spot. Consumables grew in the low single digits, driven by Chemical and Advanced Materials, Food, and Environmental and Forensics. Also, while relatively small, we continue to see strong growth in our pre-owned instrument business. The LSAG team continues to innovate, introducing two new instruments this quarter that extend our applied markets leadership. First, our 7010D GC/Triple Quad instrument delivers exceptional sensitivity for customers in the environmental PFAS and Advanced Materials markets. Designed for analysis that demand the lowest limit of detection. And second is our 8850 GC, a distinguished new member of our market-leading GC portfolio. The 8850 is ultrafast in separation and colon speeds with design innovations that enable customers to run tests up to twice as fast as regular benchtop GC. And it's the smallest high-performance benchtop GC on the market. Plus, it's sustainable, using up to 30% less electricity power compared with a traditional benchtop GC. Now moving on to the Agilent CrossLab Group, which delivered revenue of $402 million for the quarter, up 5%. ACG grew across all end markets in every region except China. The business delivered double-digit growth in services contracts which now represent almost 70% of the total business, offset by declines in new instrument installation revenues. The ongoing strength in our contracted business speaks to our strategy of increasing the connect rates on our instruments and the ongoing value we are providing to our customers. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $417 million in revenue, representing an 8% decline. Pathology was up mid-single digits globally and was more than offset by declines in the mid-20s in cell analysis due to the constrained capital environment for instrumentation. NASD declined low teens as expected, driven by more clinical products being produced this year versus Q2 of last year. Europe was a bright spot for DGG, growing low single digits in the quarter, while Americas and China declined. Despite the subdued market environment, we continue to innovate in our cell analysis business. We recently introduced the Agilent Spectrum Flow Cytometer, which allows our customers to perform sophisticated experiments that expand the range of the research on the same easy-to-use NovoCyte platform. Bob will now provide details on our results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Thanks, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full year and third quarter guidance. Q2 revenue was $1.573 billion. a decline of 7.4% core. On a reported basis, currency had a negative impact of 0.8 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 0.2%, resulting in a reported decline of 8.4%. As Padraig mentioned, Pharma, our largest end market, declined 11%, with both Biopharma and Small Molecule declining roughly the same percentage. Instrument demand continues to be constrained, while services delivered mid-single-digit growth. Looking forward, while we have seen sentiment improve, instrument purchases are still constrained and we are expecting that to continue for the rest of the year. In addition, we have reduced our expectations for NASD as several clinical programs have pushed out into next year and some commercial products have not ramped at the pace as expected. As a result, we have reduced our full year growth outlook for the Pharma end market from roughly flat to down low double digits, similar to our Q2 performance. Our revised expectation for the Pharma end market is the largest change in our outlook. The Chemical and Advanced Materials market was better than expected, declining 3% after coming off a very tough comparison of 16% growth last year. The academia and government market declined 12% against a tough compare of 11% growth last year. While soft globally, the decline was driven by China, which was down mid-30s. Our business in the Diagnostics and Clinical market declined 2%. Our pathology business continues to show resilience in this market, growing mid-single digits, while our NGS QC instrumentation business also grew slightly. These were offset by softness in our NGS chemistries business. The Environmental and Forensics market declined 2%. The business grew mid-single digits ex China, highlighted by continued strength in serving the rapidly expanding PFAS opportunity. The Food market declined 13% on a very tough compare of 21% growth last year, heavily impacted by the low 30s decline in China. On a geographic basis, all regions declined. The Americas region was down 5%. Europe was down 3%, while Asia Pacific ex China was down slightly. China was down 21%, missing our expectations of a mid-teens decline. We saw demand weakness expand beyond Pharma. As a result, we have revised our full year expectations for China for a mid-single-digit decline to a double-digit decline. We have seen funnel activity increase because of the recently announced stimulus program, but we are not assuming any revenue impact in our fiscal year. Moving down to P&L. Our second quarter gross margin was 55.6%, up 30 basis points from a year ago as productivity and cost savings were offset by lower demand and mix. Our operating margin of 25.1% was down year-over-year as expected. Below the line, we benefited from greater-than-expected interest income and a lower tax rate. Our tax rate was 12.5%, and we had 293 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.22, down 4% from a year ago, less than the decline in revenue and ahead of our expectations. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $333 million in the quarter and we invested $103 million in capital expenditures as we continue our planned NASD expansion. We returned $299 million to shareholders in the quarter, $69 million through dividends and $230 million through repurchase shares, catching up on our anti-dilutive buying year-to-date. In summary, we met our expectations for the quarter our markets are recovering but at a slower pace than we anticipated. We are directing our energy towards high-growth opportunities and are committed to delivering value to our customers and our shareholders. Now on to our revised outlook for the year and our third quarter guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $6.42 billion to $6.50 billion. This represents a decline of 6.0% to 4.9% on a reported basis and a decline of 5.4% to 4.3% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 60 basis points. This is a $300 million reduction at the midpoint and is primarily related to changes in two areas: China overall in the Pharma end market outside of China. For China, we have reduced our expectations to a double-digit decline from mid-single digits with all end markets being reduced. This represents roughly $70 million of the guidance reduction. The remainder of the change in the Pharma end market globally outside of China is due to two factors. The first and largest factor is continued caution in budget releases and extended approval times for instrumentation purchases in both Small and Large Molecules. This is roughly $175 million of the change. The second factor is related to NASD due to the reasons I mentioned earlier, and represents the remaining $55 million reduction. While down from our previous guidance, we are expecting growth in the second half of the year to be roughly 400 basis points better than the first half of the year and plan to exit the year roughly flat year-on-year at the midpoint of the new guidance. Full year non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $5.15 and $5.25, representing a decline of 5.3% to 3.5%. This incorporates a roughly $35 million expense reduction due to the actions Padraig mentioned. The majority hit in Q4 in order to help mitigate the bottom-line impact of the change to our revenue guidance. It also assumes a 13% tax rate and 292 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We will leverage our strong balance sheet and plan to repurchase $750 million of our shares in the second half of the year in addition to our anti-dilutive repurchases. We expect these repurchases to be weighted towards Q3. All told, we expect to return roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders this year between dividends and share repurchases. In addition, the Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will go into effect August 1 and replace the existing authorization. Now for our Q3 guidance, we expect revenue will be in the range of $1.535 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents a decline of 8.2% to 5.8% on a reported basis and a decline of 6.9% to 4.5% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined were a headwind of 130 basis points. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing a decline of 12.6% to 10.5%. Looking forward, we remain disciplined. We're focusing on what we can control and driving strong execution in a challenging market, and we are optimistic about the long-term future. Now back to Padraig.\nPadraig McDonnell: When I joined you last quarter as CEO-elect, I said Agilent has a compelling story to tell, and I was excited by the possibilities that lie before us as we help our customers bring great science to life. That excitement has only grown. I spent 26 years at Agilent, first starting as a field employee before moving to sales and then leading some of our businesses. I know Agilent's strengths and its opportunities very well. We are in great long-term growth markets. And while the markets are recovering slower than anticipated, they are recovering. This company is a leader across key platforms, making us uniquely qualified to support our customers and their missions to solve some of the world's most important problems. And our customers value their relationships with us because we offer them an unparalleled experience. And as I said earlier, that is a competitive differentiator in the market. The actions we are now taking, while difficult, will enable us to quickly capitalize on growth opportunities as the markets fully recover. I know the future is bright, and we will forge an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers and create value for our shareholders. Thank you again for joining today's call. I look forward to continued dialogue with all of you. Parmeet, over to you for Q&A.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Padraig. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for the Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nMatt Sykes: Maybe just the first one is more of a timing question on China. I mean we've been through a lot of quarterly results this season and the stabilization theme in China has been pretty consistent and you guys have talked about sequential stabilization over the last number of quarters. So, was this really an April impact that you saw in China? And if so, what was sort of the deceleration that you saw there? And what were some of the causes of it?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think while Q2 was relatively soft to guidance, we adjusted the H2 outlook, what we're seeing in China is we saw a -- stability over a number of quarters. What we really believe is that this is not a material deterioration from that. But what we've seen is that we've seen the stimulus have some effect and the stimulus has been much larger than previous stimulus. It's over multi-years. And of course, customers are looking about what are the components of that and they're looking at some of the areas and where it's going to help them. So that has had a material effect. We don't see the stimulus having an impact in H2, but we do think it's going to have an impact in '25. I think there's kind of a direct and indirect side of the stimulus. I think on the direct side, you see this delay, which is normal, but you see also the indirect side where, the government is investing in technology and sciences going forward, which creates a lot of, I would say, future momentum.\nMatt Sykes: Got it. And then just for my follow-up, you guys have often talked about sort of 18- to 24-month down cycle in the LC replacement cycle. And I'm just wondering just given some of the comments you made around Biopharma, given that's an important customer segment for that, have you kind of changed those views in terms of what the LC replacement cycle will look like and what the potential recovery in the replacement cycle will look like? I think some were thinking sort of towards the end of this year, but is this more now into 2025, is that replacement cycle been extended in terms of recovery?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, we don't see any material change. But Bob, I don't know if you want to add some color on that.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I think, Matt, as you said, we're still expecting improvement in the back half of this year, just not at the pace that we had expected. And so, we're not seeing any material extension of kind of the use case for LC or an LC/MS in the marketplace and are still expecting recovery in '25.\nOperator: Our next question will from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.\nJack Meehan: I was wondering if you could share what's the new sales outlook for an ASP this year? And can you talk about like bridging from kind of the second half to some of the longer-term targets you've had previously. Like what are you assuming in terms of kind of progression after this year?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I mean the NASD business, we talked before about the business being about 50% commercial and 50% clinical that's changed a bit to be more like 75% clinical and 25% commercial. We've seen the IRA inflation Reduction Act having an impact on the price provisioning. So, what you see with Pharma partners, they are looking for larger indications instead of smaller indications. So, what we've seen is, I would call it, an air pocket in Q3. And our clinical business is actually growing. Orders are growing about 50%. So, we're -- we have a good order book on that side. So, it's a readjustment and we see that readjustment go through H2 and beyond. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Yes, I think Jack to add some numbers to what Padraig was saying here. Originally, we were expecting it to be roughly flat, which would have said roughly a $350 million business. We're now seeing roughly $300 million this year. As Padraig is mentioning, we're expecting to build back from there as these clinical programs move through the clinical pathway and are expecting to have more volume in '25. And I would say our long-term perspective on NASD remains unchanged. We're still very excited about that opportunity and are still building out the capacity in our Colorado site.\nPadraig McDonnell: Second question, I think the second part of the question was about '25. We'll grow next year. And as you can see in our guidance that we really are anticipating improving conditions across the second half, but it's too early to talk about specific ranges for next year. We want to wait to see how pacing an improvement plans out in the second half.\nJack Meehan: And then on the cost savings program, I think I heard talk about $100 million. I just wanted to clarify, is that incremental to the $175 million you previously talked about? And where are those -- any color on where the savings is coming from?\nBob McMahon: Yes, it is incremental to the savings that we've already built into the plan, and we're expecting to get that annualized savings by the end of the year. It's primarily headcount-related, Jack.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Donnelly: Maybe one on the instrument side, I guess it will be China and then just broadly, I know a few quarters ago, you guys felt like orders were picking up, the funnel looked okay, but it was really that I think, Bob, you said it was the velocity of conversion of those orders in that funnel to revenue. Is that what you're seeing is just that continues to stretch out the visibility into that normalizing. It's just proving to be a little trickier. I just want to talk through, I guess, that instrument piece because again, you sound okay on the orders in the funnel and the conversation, but that converting over rim, I guess that I just want to talk through again, the conversion piece and the velocity of the conversion.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Yes. No, I think at an at level, as we talked about, our book-to-bill was greater than one, which is a positive sign and where orders grew year-over-year. On the instrument side, the orders grew low single digits, excluding China, but declined low single digits overall. So, what we're really seeing is that our funnel is really stable, but we're seeing those extended purchasing decisions being continuing to extend out through the second half.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I think, Patrick, to build on what Padraig is saying at the beginning of the year, we were expecting when we were talking primarily to our Pharma customers, budgets weren't being materially cut outside of a specific number of well-publicized customers. And we were expecting to see by our second quarter, some of these budgets being released. And what we're seeing now is still a very cautious environment. And so, the funnel is still there. We are seeing our book-to-bill as Padraig mentioned, to be greater than one. We just haven't seen that inflection, which we would have expected to see at least in our order book. One of the things that we do see and it primarily happened late in the quarter is our teams are paid on first half versus second half quota. And so, our April numbers are usually quite large, which prepares us for the -- for Q3 and we just didn't see that inflection in late April, which we normally would see.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful color. And then maybe to follow up on Jack's question on NASD there. You understand the revenue change. How are you guys thinking about the capital investment on that front? Obviously, it's been sizable in the past years, you've often talked about the continued expansion of the trains. How do you think about the CapEx devoted to this over the next few years? Has there been any change in terms of push out of that capital? Or how you're thinking about the potential investment and the expansion on this front just given the shift in revenue here.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No, absolutely not. I think despite some near-term headwinds that we have, the medium, long-term story for NSAD is really holds firm. And as I said before, we're seeing our clinical business grow more than 50% this year, and we really remain excited about the expansion of customers. And getting back to the therapeutic class that we're involved in with siRNAs drugs, we're seeing those approvals for drugs increase substantially in 2023. And being an integral part of the manufacturers of several of these on market therapeutics, the future is extremely bright in this area. So, no change in our capital investment.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Patrick, just one other thing to add on to that as I'm sure you're aware, as part of that expansion, not only are we expanding capacity, we're also expanding our therapeutic options. So, not only siRNA but also anti-sense and also CRISPR opportunity. So, it also provides us with more capabilities to support our existing and new client base.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nVijay Kumar: I guess Padraig or Bob, thanks for laying out the changes in the guidance assumptions here, right. I think part of it was China, part of it was NASD. But more than half, I think, it's coming from Pharma cautiousness that's outside of China, ex-NASD, which I think that the market. I thought we were expecting stabilization. Is this a funding environment kind of question or is elections or what changed because second quarter, it feels like revenues were roughly in line -- was it the exit rate? Can you just talk about what the exit rate trends were and what customers are telling you?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I mean on the Pharma instrumentation side, in terms of guidance, we see an impact of about $175 million and it really simply Pharma's willingness to spend in capital equipment remains challenged over time. And again, customers are focusing on lab efficiency and productivity. But based on what we're hearing from customers, these trends will continue to impact the second half. And that's why we're lowering our expectations around that instrument piece. What I will say that the formulas are holding very strong. The conversations are very robust with customers, so we do expect it to improve going into next year.\nBob McMahon: Vijay, to build on what Padraig is saying, the guidance that we're building out right now is based on what we're seeing today. It doesn't assume any meaningful inflection. That certainly -- I'd characterize this as a prudent guide given what we know today. Certainly, we're not assuming any of that inflection. You bring up a number of variables, which are hard to quantify around the upcoming election and so forth. But we don't think it's a funding issue. We do feel like we are seeing biotech funding coming up. Obviously, on the Small Molecule side, those are they're well-capitalized companies. It's just a very -- it's still cautious in terms of them getting through their approval processes.\nVijay Kumar: And just maybe related to that Padraig, Bob. I think is this just a few handful of customers or across the Board? Because obviously, the next question is, is this a share loss? Or is this more of -- what gives you the confidence that this is just a pushout and not a share shift on the savings or cost savings, Bob, that 35 is in Q4. So the expectations is the incremental 65 is for fiscal '25.\nBob McMahon: Let me answer the last question first. So that is a cumulative number for the second half of the year. We'll see some of that happen here in Q3 and roughly be at that $100 million run rate in Q4. So roughly about a $25 million run rate and then we'll get the full incremental 65, obviously, next year as we go into the business. Do you want to comment?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Yes, look, when we look across our Pharma customers, we see generally, it's across the board. We do have some customers that are a little bit more positive than negative this year. But overall, I would say it's a market effect. What I would say -- on the other question, this is definitely a macro story, not a market share story. And in fact, when we look at our objective market share data, we're holding or even gaining in some areas. And I will remind you not to comment on our peers in this area, but we have a month ahead in what we're seeing on it, but we're seeing very robust market share numbers coming in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDan Brennan: Maybe first one, just on China. You talked about in response to an earlier question about the stimulus is delaying demand this year. Could you just speak through that a little bit? Like what's your visibility on that? Any way to get a sense of how much of what you should be seeing in China's customers waiting to see the final details of the stimulus. And I know you also alluded to like this could be a big impact in '25. Can you just speak through that a little bit?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I think having worked with China for many years. It's a multiyear program as opposed to the last one, which I think was a year program in the shorter term. So, it's very encouraging to see it. We've seen some proposals from customers, but they're still, quite frankly, trying to work out what are the mechanisms for the funding as we go forward. So, we're seeing a lot of activity around that. And I would say in terms of the confidence boost, we do really see that in '25, we're going to get some benefit from this, but really too early to tell on it. So, we're taking down our guidance in the second half primarily related to this.\nBob McMahon: Dan, this is Bob. To build on that, I had mentioned in our prepared remarks that bid activity has actually improved. And so, we're seeing a number of proposals working with our customers to actually get a piece of the stimulus. What's not yet clear is the timing of the release of that budget comes from the provincial -- or from the state down to the provincial and then to the local government. And so, we've taken a, what I would say, is a conservative approach to assuming none of that stimulus money will actually -- we'll see any of that in the second half of the year. But it will come, it will come. And so -- if it comes earlier, that would be a benefit to what we're forecasting right now. But we're -- what we did see, particularly in April is a little slowing down of normal bid process waiting to get access to that money. And so, we think that, that's just a transitory change, not a structural change.\nDan Brennan: Got it. And then -- and maybe just one more on Pharma, if you don't mind. So, the instrument growth was so powerful for yourselves and some of your peers coming out of COVID. Is there any chance that like the slowdown you're seeing now maybe just some miscalculation, maybe there was such instrument demand and purchase is done in the last couple of years that customers at work just kind of working through that all those purchases versus like an exceptional slowdown right now given the macro? Just maybe speak a little bit to that, if you could about the overhang for maybe the strength in the past couple of years versus what you're seeing real time now?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, no doubt about it. We've -- tremendous growth rates during the post-COVID period. But we don't see anything fundamentally changing with the cycle on instrument replacement cycles. We don't see it's a kind of a rundown of available instruments or anything like that because lab activity is very, very high. We see that across the board. We actually see activity on the sales side, but also on the support side, very, very high. So we think it's primarily actually on the macro situation.\nBob McMahon: Yes. And Dan, just to kind of build on what Padraig had said. We looked at ACG and our CSD or our consumables business outside of China, both of those grew mid- to high single digits in the quarter. So, it does speak to lab activity. They're not having instruments just sitting idle. And in ACG, our contracted services business continues to perform extraordinarily well, up double digits. So, the demand is there outside of China right now.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRachel Vatnsdal: So first up, I just wanted to ask on China. We've seen some of the headlines from BIOSECURE Act. So, I was wondering if you could break down your exposure to large CDMOs in the region? And if that contributed to any of the weakness there just given me some of the commentary from an RFP standpoint? And then just on China stimulus and some of the dynamics there, how should we think about local competition competing for some of these dollars on the stimulus dynamic and you talked about some of these proposals that you're working on. So, can you detail what sectors, what types of customers are you really seeing that proposal work be done right now?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look, I think on the BIOSECURE Act, we see normal -- people are looking at their supply chains, and that's positives and negatives around the globe. As you see that one of the areas that we've seen from that is actually we see a benefit on our service business as we relocate laboratories in some cases and get them up and running quickly with our services on that one. So, definitely some exposure to CDMO, but I would say not the overall macro side on it. And then I think the second part, Bob, I don't know if you want to take that one?\nBob McMahon: Yes. I would say just a building on that point on our questions around CDMO, most of our business in China is local. So, it's not multinational and so wouldn't necessarily fall under the BIOSECURE Act. There are certain large companies that are on that list that are customers of ours, but that is that business has been pretty muted for a while, and that's not the cause of the incremental weakness here. I would say on the bid activity, it's about -- it's across the board. It's not in one region of the country or one end market or customers and obviously, Chinese local competitors are going to be buying for that business like we are. But I think we've shown time and time again our ability to provide very strong and robust instrumentation, coupled with very good service. And so, I don't think that we're in any disadvantage from a local perspective from that standpoint.\nPadraig McDonnell: In fact, Bob, I would say our scale and service there really makes it a differentiator where we can scale with customers and get them up and running very, very quickly. We take the competition very seriously. But we've always had competition in China, and we continue to keep a focus on that.\nRachel Vatnsdal: Great. And then for my follow-up, just given some of the moving pieces on this fiscal 3Q guide, could you walk us through your expectations by segment for 3Q?\nBob McMahon: Sure. I'll take that real quick. By business group, we're expecting LSAG to be down double-digits DGG down mid-single and ACG growing at mid-single digits. If we looked at by end market, Pharma, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, would be down very similar to Q2, so down low double digits. And with academia and diagnostics markets being roughly flat, Chemical and Advanced Materials being very similar to Q2 results. And then Food being down roughly the same, maybe a little better than where we saw Q2 as well. And then Environmental and Forensics similar performance as Q2.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nDoug Schenkel: I guess, I have too high level, but I think important questions. One is Yes. Simply put, I want to get your thoughts as we sit here today about the Company's long-term growth outlook. And essentially, to what top line growth rate are you managing the business as you think about the next few years? In Pharma and Biotech, you have less exposure as a percentage of sales to some of the higher growth areas of that end market and the outlook for one of your higher growth areas, NASD within Biopharma it's certainly in question amongst investors given how things have been going recently. And while there is hope that China stimulus will help across many end markets, as we kind of think past that, ultimately, many believe the durable growth rate in China where you're overexposed will be materially lower than what we've seen in years past. And then as we think of other discrete differentiating growth drivers for the Company, when we look at CrossLabs and DGG, the growth rates have moderated there in part because of the market, but also in part because you did have above-average concentration with one high-growth diagnostic companies as an example. So, there's a lot of bad guys here right now. Obviously, in the long term, there's a lot of belief in Agilent in how you run the business. But I think there are a lot of questions when you kind of pull all this together about what is the inherent growth rate of this business. Can you share any thoughts on that?\nPadraig McDonnell: Maybe I'll kick it off a bit at a high level. I think, first of all, we participate in excellent markets with multiple long-term growth drivers. You look at the characterization that's going to be needed in biotherapeutics in time, improving human health. Quality of our Food is really going to be a continued growth driver for the Company. I would say there's a lot of growth factors within the business that in adjacent markets where we continue to invest in those opportunities. You've seen part of Biopharma, PFAS. And I do believe NASD long term is going to continue to grow. In our service business, we expect that to grow high single digits over the long term as we increase our attach rate, which is not a small point because every percentage increase in attach rate is about $30 million incremental on that side. So overall, I think we're in extremely durable long-term markets. On the China story, we're going to see probably getting down to more mature level growth rates in China, but I would remind everybody that there are secular drivers in China that continue to come up and the government continues to invest in science and technology, but also the scale of the country being so large, we benefit tremendously from the aftermarket element consumable and service around that and being able to kind of drive attachment to some of the emerging workflows. So, Bob, I don't know if you have anything to add on that?\nBob McMahon: Yes, I would just say, as we think about kind of our long-term algorithm that we've been talking about, that 5% to 7%, we're not ready to walk away from that. I think we still feel good about that. And I think while you talked about some of the bad guys, we still believe in Biopharma and are continuing to invest there. In addition, Padraig mentioned a few things on the applied side where we are the undisputed leader. So, things like PFAS, the electrification, semiconductors, those things weren't there five years ago to the extent that they're going to be there in the next five years. So certainly, the markets are a bit challenging right now, but we are seeing them recover, and we would expect to be able to get back to those rates in the near term.\nDoug Schenkel: Okay. And Bob, maybe sticking with you. If we go back to the beginning of the year when you set guidance for the fiscal year. Yes, I think it's fair to say there were a number of questions from the investment community about how you were setting guidance for the year. Specifically, there was concern about the plausibility of what you assumed for the second half. In hindsight, obviously, these questions and concern to be well-founded. What went wrong? Does this tell you something about your visibility for the business? If so, is it a transitory issue? And if that's the case, can you help us explain why? And if it's not visibility, what do you need to do in terms of changing your guidance philosophy moving forward?\nBob McMahon: Yes. Thanks, Doug. And I think it is visibility. I think if you looked across the last seven years, the two most volatile years have been the last two. And so, I think we were expecting based on the feedback that we got from our customers that they would be releasing budgets much more quickly than what they have or at least what we're seeing and while we did have an expectation that we were going to see an inflection in the back half of this year, when we're talking to our customers, it just hasn't happened. And so, I think the visibility is something that I think will we will get back, particularly as we have more recurring revenue and continue to have the connect rate on to the services business. And we're disappointed as everyone else is, but you can rest assured that we're going to come out of this stronger going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please go ahead. Dan, your line might be on mute. Our next question will come from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Ryskin: I want to pick things up exactly where you just ended on the last answer with Doug on visibility. So, I mean you kind of talked about how you had a certain set of expectations going into the year based on conversations with customers that didn't play out. I mean, is that -- is there any reason to think that visibility is better now, I guess, is my question, if we look at the guide change and specifically focusing on Pharma with or without an NASD, if you want to just talk about Pharma, the CapEx of Pharma and NASD, it seems like visibility there is still really, really challenged. So, on the one hand, a lot of your prepared remarks are markets are improving. But on the other hand, you're not expecting in 3Q because you just talked about low double digits. It doesn't seem that you're expecting for the rest of the year. So just exiting the year, entering next year, how do we know we're not going to be having the same conversation again about another push out and then another push out? Just talk about that visibility going forward.\nBob McMahon: Yes. I think if we look at just first half, second half and look at where our core guidance is, it's not assuming any inflection in the back half. I mean you could make an argument that typically, we have a higher weighting towards the back half of the year, just part of normal seasonality, and we're not assuming that in our guide. And so, if you look at also Pharma, we're assuming it's down roughly the same as it's been in the first half of the year, but we'll get easier compares. And so, we're not expecting \"a big inflection in the back half of the year.\" I would say also on NASD, which we are assuming a reduction in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year, we have all those orders in-house. And so, we've got a plan, a production plan and both for Q3 and Q4. And while something could happen, it's not like we're looking for orders to guide us on those. And those are the two big areas that made the biggest change when I think about where we were back in November, giving guidance to where we are today.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. And Bob, since you touched on 3Q, 4Q ramp, I'm going to follow up on that as well, actually. I mean, you normally do see some seasonality third quarter, the fourth quarter, depending on the year, depending on the comp, let's call it about $100 million, maybe $100 million plus. You're something that your guide for 3Q and fiscal year implies about $120 million repeat to 4Q for this year. So again, not excessive, but still some step-up and it seems like 2Q and 3Q certainly are below trend. So, is there any risk to that 4Q number? I mean is there anything else we should be thinking about in terms of what makes that achievable besides just comp and seasonality?\nBob McMahon: Yes. The biggest change there is our NASD business, which we will see a low water point here in Q3 if we -- what we ended up seeing is some of these clinical programs getting pushed out. They've got pushed out from Q3 into Q4. And so, there's a $30 million incremental step-up from Q3 to Q4. So, if you took that out, we did get back to a more historical kind of level.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDan Arias: Bob or Padraig, on the capital equipment portfolio and the order book and the sales funnel that you have there, maybe just in simplistic terms, how would you describe the average time to deal close that it feels like you're going to be working with in the back half of the year versus what you've seen as a historical average? And embedded in that is just this question on instrument demand that you have a line of sight on via the sales funnel, but that just hasn't been booked yet versus what's not materialized at all yet? And then how the outlook change reflects those two things.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Look at it, I think it's hard to put a number on the extended deal time. It depends actually on the platform and portfolio. So, there's quite a big difference between, for example, GC and LCMS on that. But what I would say, in general, the deal time is prolonged. The win rates, of course, haven't changed. They're still very, very strong, but that deal time is prolonged. And I think if you look at it in the second half when we're looking at the visibility of what we're seeing in the funnel, the best thing and we're doing is staying close to customers on this one, making sure we're there to help them, of course, with their decisions and help them get up and running when they make the decision to purchase on it. So, we're going to see this continued extended deal time, I think, through the end -- through the second half.\nBob McMahon: Yes. Dan, I wish I could say we have all the orders in-house for the second half for instruments. It just doesn't work that way. So, we have much better visibility into Q3, but we will need continued performance in Q3. Now we've had several quarters here of book-to-bills being greater than one in our instrumentation portfolio, which is a positive thing. I would say, hey, we're building some backlog. And as Padraig mentioned earlier in the call, particularly in LSAG. LSAG orders grew ex-China. And that is the first time that's happened in several quarters. So, we are seeing some positives and if you look at the second half of the year, our performance relative to last year should improve just because of the benefit of easier compares. And so -- we're not, again, looking for that huge inflection. And we're not expecting also as Padraig was saying, a constriction, so to speak, or an acceleration of those deal funnels. We're expecting them to stay very similar to the way they are right now.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. I think just to close off, Bob, I think the deal closure time lines remain at an elevated but very stable level. They're not deteriorating further, which I think is a really good sign. And in terms of the funnel is stable, no cancellations within that, which, of course, is very important to see.\nDan Arias: Okay. And then maybe on -- as a follow-up on Biopharma. I'm just curious about the extent to which the IRA is part of the conversation there these days. It sounded like last year, the industry kind of contemplated an adjustment as the idea was coming into the picture. So, do you think spending expectations got rightsized for a period of time? Are you finding that that's sort of a continual evolving conversation?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I would say it's a continuing evolving conversation. Clearly, on the NASD side, we've seen an impact from the IRA something we're watching closely, but I think this will evolve over time. What we're seeing in terms of programs-based around pricing provisions, there definitely has been an impact on that side.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleeland Research. Please go ahead.\nJosh Waldman: A couple for you. Padraig or Bob, I wondered if you could talk a bit more on how instrument orders progressed sequentially. I mean did orders deteriorate over the last 90 days or really just a function of orders not improving as you expected? And then I wondered if you could comment on what you're seeing from new orders, new order perspective across the key product categories within LSAG categories like LC/MS, GC, ICP. I guess is it fair to assume LC/MS is driving the majority of the softness just given the comments on Pharma.\nPadraig McDonnell: I don't know if you want to take that one, Bob.\nBob McMahon: Yes, I'll take it. So, I wouldn't characterize it, Josh, is a deterioration. It actually just wasn't the inflection or the acceleration that we were expecting. We did -- as we were saying here, we did have a positive book-to-bill and ex China orders grew. They just didn't grow to the extent that we expected them to, particularly in April, which we would typically have higher acceleration just kind of given the end of the quarter. In terms of the platform, what you're seeing is the platforms that are more focused on Pharma being the areas that are the weakest. So, LC and LC/MS are weaker than the applied markets. And you can kind of see that in our end markets as well. And so, we were expecting those to kind of perform better this year, and we're just still seeing that, I'd say, lower-than-expected performance from the standpoint of order velocity.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Okay. Then a follow-up on China. I wondered if you could comment a bit more on where we\u2019re seeing\u2026\nBob McMahon: I would say -- sorry, just one quick -- so one thing I would say, though, is if I looked at the performance, the revenue performance versus the order performance, the order performance was significantly better in Q2 on those two main platforms than the revenue. So again, these are points that says we are getting out of it, maybe not at the pace that we were expecting. So -- and so those are some positive points that would suggest that we're going to continue to -- it's not going to deteriorate coming out in Q2 -- or excuse me, in second half. Sorry.\nJosh Waldman: Is it -- what were the two platforms?\nBob McMahon: LC and LC/MS. So yes. Yes.\nJosh Waldman: Okay. Okay. Got it. Got it. And then a follow-up on China. I just wondered if you could comment a bit more on where all you're seeing demand coming softer than expected from a new booking\u2019s perspective and then a bit more detail on how you're contemplating the stimulus. I mean, it sounds like you saw improved bidding and funnel activity on the prospects of stimulus, but just wondered if you could provide what's giving you the confidence that, that stimulus related funnel ends up converting to orders and sales at some point in the future?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Maybe starting on the stimulus. This is an extremely large program, a multiyear program. It's very real. We've seen some of the customers with activity is asking us to bid and some of the things, even though they're not sure exactly yet how the mechanisms would work. So that gives us great confidence for '25 just from that. But I said earlier, also the indirect impact of confidence in science and technology in China. It's a real photo confidence by the government in making sure we -- making sure to get the market going again. So, I think in -- we saw meaningful softness extend to all markets because remember, the stimulus is not only academia and government, it's across all markets. And that has really come at once. And we did see at the end of the quarter, we also started to see customers postpone purchasing decisions have told us, right, sort of said we're going to postpone and they try to gauge if there's any benefit of the stimulus-related funding, and that's normal. I think that's expected. If you didn't see that, then the stimulus would have different questions. And why we believe that a stimulus program will ultimately be long-term positive, we really don't see any benefit in H2, and that's why we're roughly reducing by $70 million.\nJosh Waldman: Got it. Did you see stimulus-related postponing and Pharma and CDMO as well or more just government accounts?\nBob McMahon: Yes, it was both government and non-government accounts across the board. So, I would say it was pretty broad beyond Pharma.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please go ahead.\nCatherine Schulte: Maybe just sticking on China stimulus to start off. Is there any way to quantify the increase in the funnel activity that you've seen there just as we try to think about potential opportunity in future years?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. What we're seeing is a postponement, and I think it's really too early to tell on the funnel side on -- if the customers are still working out the mechanisms about how it works, we're still waiting to see on the impact on the panel, particularly for '25, it's too early to tell.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay. And then on LSAG, what was performance in the quarter, excluding China? And then any commentary on the Pharma end market specifically for that business outside of China in the quarter?\nPadraig McDonnell: Bob, do you want to take this one?\nBob McMahon: Yes. So, our LSAG business declined 13% globally, ex-China, it was down 8%.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nPaul Knight: Within the 34% of business that's Pharma, what portion is Biopharma or Large Molecule, Bob?\nBob McMahon: It's roughly 45%.\nPaul Knight: And what's the overall growth rate of that piece, do you think?\nBob McMahon: Long term or in the quarter?\nPaul Knight: In the quarter and long term.\nBob McMahon: Yes. So, if we looked at our Biopharma business, it was down roughly 12%, Small Molecule was down roughly 10%. Total Pharma was down 11%. So, it kind of gives you a sense. I think.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes, I would say before we get on to the long term, Bob, for Biopharma, really tough compare was mid-teens, plus mid-teens last year on that side. But what we're seeing is the long-term prospect for this market is very strong.\nPaul Knight: Yes. And then I know that you've got -- you have always been very aggressive and innovative on your M&A for biologics. Are you seeing that market open up on the M&A side of that marketplace?\nPadraig McDonnell: You mean in the space itself.\nPaul Knight: Is pricing becoming more realistic as you think about your acquisition strategy?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Well, I think there's long memories. So, people don't forget the elevated pricing for assets, but we're going to remain very disciplined. It's going to become an increasingly bigger part of the puzzle for us M&A, but we're going to make sure that we do it in a very disciplined way, link to strategy and of course, looking at areas of where we can double down and growth factors. So we're very focused on that going forward. But I would say, while pricing maybe has come down in little areas across the board, people have long memories.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Parmeet Ahuja for closing remarks.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Regina, and thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. With that, we would like to end the call. Have a good rest of the day, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Padraig McDonnell",
            "content": "Thanks, Parmeet. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. I want to begin by saying I'm incredibly honored to serve as CEO of this great company, and I'm thankful for the opportunity to lead such a talented team. I truly believe the Agilent team is second to none, and I'm energized about the future possibilities that lie ahead of us. I also want to take this time to welcome our new DGG President, Simon May to the Agilent team. Simon's diversified experience, strong technical skills and growth mindset will be a key asset in this role. Since starting earlier this month, Simon has hit the ground running, and I am really looking forward to him helping move DGG and Agilent forward. Before I talk about the quarterly results, I'd like to tell you how I spent my time since the announcement in February that I will become Agilent's CEO. I've been meeting and connecting with employees, customers and shareholders around the world to listen to their perspectives and how we should build on our strengths and evolve Agilent. What they have told me is clear, Agilent must become even more customer focused and even more nimble to continue to win in the marketplace and add value to customers and shareholders. This has really resonated with our employees and customers. As an energized Agilent team, we will evolve our strategy, adapting quickly to market trends and changes while accelerating our pace of innovation in areas of greatest return for long-term growth. We will double down on our customer first culture, deepening our relationship to further enhance our market-leading customer experience that is already the best in the industry. Now let's talk about the Q2 results and outlook moving forward. In a challenging market environment, the Agilent team delivered on expectations. In the second quarter, we reported revenue of $1.573 billion, a 7.4% decline. This was against a tough compare of 9.5% growth in Q2 of last year. While revenues declined in the quarter, our book-to-bill was greater than one, and orders grew year-over-year for the first time in seven quarters. Earnings per share of $1.22 beat our expectations and represented a 4% decline from the second quarter of 2023. Now looking forward, the market environment continues to be challenging, but we are seeing early signs of recovery. However, as we announced in our press release, this market recovery is not at the pace we anticipated when we provided guidance earlier in the year. As a result, we are reducing our market growth expectations and revising our full year core revenue to be in the range of $6.42 billion to $6.5 billion and growth to decline between 4.3% and 5.4%. We now expect earnings per share to be between $5.15 and $5.25 for the year. We have responded quickly to the lower market growth expectations and are taking difficult, but necessary actions to streamline our cost structure. These actions will allow us to invest in our most promising growth opportunities while also delivering incremental annualized savings of $100 million by the end of the fiscal year. We are sharpening our focus on key growth vectors such as Biopharma, PFAS and Advanced Materials, while also investing in our digital ecosystem, and accelerating our innovation to drive even faster execution. And we are leveraging our strong balance sheet and plan to repurchase $750 million of our common stock across the third and four quarters, over and above our normal anti-dilutive repurchases. Bob will provide more details on our results and latest outlook in his remarks. Getting back to Q2 results. As expected, all end markets saw a declining revenue in Q2. Geographically, the Americas and Europe came in slightly ahead of expectations, while China lagged. Despite the challenging market conditions, our Agilent team stay close to our customers and continue to leverage our strong relationships with them to execute remarkably well while maintaining strong cost discipline. When we look at our performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group reported $754 million in revenue, down 13%. The group saw a decline across all end markets and regions, with consumables being a bright spot. Consumables grew in the low single digits, driven by Chemical and Advanced Materials, Food, and Environmental and Forensics. Also, while relatively small, we continue to see strong growth in our pre-owned instrument business. The LSAG team continues to innovate, introducing two new instruments this quarter that extend our applied markets leadership. First, our 7010D GC/Triple Quad instrument delivers exceptional sensitivity for customers in the environmental PFAS and Advanced Materials markets. Designed for analysis that demand the lowest limit of detection. And second is our 8850 GC, a distinguished new member of our market-leading GC portfolio. The 8850 is ultrafast in separation and colon speeds with design innovations that enable customers to run tests up to twice as fast as regular benchtop GC. And it's the smallest high-performance benchtop GC on the market. Plus, it's sustainable, using up to 30% less electricity power compared with a traditional benchtop GC. Now moving on to the Agilent CrossLab Group, which delivered revenue of $402 million for the quarter, up 5%. ACG grew across all end markets in every region except China. The business delivered double-digit growth in services contracts which now represent almost 70% of the total business, offset by declines in new instrument installation revenues. The ongoing strength in our contracted business speaks to our strategy of increasing the connect rates on our instruments and the ongoing value we are providing to our customers. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group posted $417 million in revenue, representing an 8% decline. Pathology was up mid-single digits globally and was more than offset by declines in the mid-20s in cell analysis due to the constrained capital environment for instrumentation. NASD declined low teens as expected, driven by more clinical products being produced this year versus Q2 of last year. Europe was a bright spot for DGG, growing low single digits in the quarter, while Americas and China declined. Despite the subdued market environment, we continue to innovate in our cell analysis business. We recently introduced the Agilent Spectrum Flow Cytometer, which allows our customers to perform sophisticated experiments that expand the range of the research on the same easy-to-use NovoCyte platform. Bob will now provide details on our results as well as our outlook for the remainder of the year. After Bob delivers his comments, I will be back for some closing remarks. Over to you, Bob. When I joined you last quarter as CEO-elect, I said Agilent has a compelling story to tell, and I was excited by the possibilities that lie before us as we help our customers bring great science to life. That excitement has only grown. I spent 26 years at Agilent, first starting as a field employee before moving to sales and then leading some of our businesses. I know Agilent's strengths and its opportunities very well. We are in great long-term growth markets. And while the markets are recovering slower than anticipated, they are recovering. This company is a leader across key platforms, making us uniquely qualified to support our customers and their missions to solve some of the world's most important problems. And our customers value their relationships with us because we offer them an unparalleled experience. And as I said earlier, that is a competitive differentiator in the market. The actions we are now taking, while difficult, will enable us to quickly capitalize on growth opportunities as the markets fully recover. I know the future is bright, and we will forge an enduring company that sets the standard for excellence with our customers and create value for our shareholders. Thank you again for joining today's call. I look forward to continued dialogue with all of you. Parmeet, over to you for Q&A. Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think while Q2 was relatively soft to guidance, we adjusted the H2 outlook, what we're seeing in China is we saw a -- stability over a number of quarters. What we really believe is that this is not a material deterioration from that. But what we've seen is that we've seen the stimulus have some effect and the stimulus has been much larger than previous stimulus. It's over multi-years. And of course, customers are looking about what are the components of that and they're looking at some of the areas and where it's going to help them. So that has had a material effect. We don't see the stimulus having an impact in H2, but we do think it's going to have an impact in '25. I think there's kind of a direct and indirect side of the stimulus. I think on the direct side, you see this delay, which is normal, but you see also the indirect side where, the government is investing in technology and sciences going forward, which creates a lot of, I would say, future momentum. Yes, we don't see any material change. But Bob, I don't know if you want to add some color on that. Yes. I mean the NASD business, we talked before about the business being about 50% commercial and 50% clinical that's changed a bit to be more like 75% clinical and 25% commercial. We've seen the IRA inflation Reduction Act having an impact on the price provisioning. So, what you see with Pharma partners, they are looking for larger indications instead of smaller indications. So, what we've seen is, I would call it, an air pocket in Q3. And our clinical business is actually growing. Orders are growing about 50%. So, we're -- we have a good order book on that side. So, it's a readjustment and we see that readjustment go through H2 and beyond. I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Bob. Second question, I think the second part of the question was about '25. We'll grow next year. And as you can see in our guidance that we really are anticipating improving conditions across the second half, but it's too early to talk about specific ranges for next year. We want to wait to see how pacing an improvement plans out in the second half. Yes. Yes. No, I think at an at level, as we talked about, our book-to-bill was greater than one, which is a positive sign and where orders grew year-over-year. On the instrument side, the orders grew low single digits, excluding China, but declined low single digits overall. So, what we're really seeing is that our funnel is really stable, but we're seeing those extended purchasing decisions being continuing to extend out through the second half. Yes. No, absolutely not. I think despite some near-term headwinds that we have, the medium, long-term story for NSAD is really holds firm. And as I said before, we're seeing our clinical business grow more than 50% this year, and we really remain excited about the expansion of customers. And getting back to the therapeutic class that we're involved in with siRNAs drugs, we're seeing those approvals for drugs increase substantially in 2023. And being an integral part of the manufacturers of several of these on market therapeutics, the future is extremely bright in this area. So, no change in our capital investment. Yes. I mean on the Pharma instrumentation side, in terms of guidance, we see an impact of about $175 million and it really simply Pharma's willingness to spend in capital equipment remains challenged over time. And again, customers are focusing on lab efficiency and productivity. But based on what we're hearing from customers, these trends will continue to impact the second half. And that's why we're lowering our expectations around that instrument piece. What I will say that the formulas are holding very strong. The conversations are very robust with customers, so we do expect it to improve going into next year. Yes. Yes, look, when we look across our Pharma customers, we see generally, it's across the board. We do have some customers that are a little bit more positive than negative this year. But overall, I would say it's a market effect. What I would say -- on the other question, this is definitely a macro story, not a market share story. And in fact, when we look at our objective market share data, we're holding or even gaining in some areas. And I will remind you not to comment on our peers in this area, but we have a month ahead in what we're seeing on it, but we're seeing very robust market share numbers coming in. Yes. Look, I think having worked with China for many years. It's a multiyear program as opposed to the last one, which I think was a year program in the shorter term. So, it's very encouraging to see it. We've seen some proposals from customers, but they're still, quite frankly, trying to work out what are the mechanisms for the funding as we go forward. So, we're seeing a lot of activity around that. And I would say in terms of the confidence boost, we do really see that in '25, we're going to get some benefit from this, but really too early to tell on it. So, we're taking down our guidance in the second half primarily related to this. Yes, no doubt about it. We've -- tremendous growth rates during the post-COVID period. But we don't see anything fundamentally changing with the cycle on instrument replacement cycles. We don't see it's a kind of a rundown of available instruments or anything like that because lab activity is very, very high. We see that across the board. We actually see activity on the sales side, but also on the support side, very, very high. So we think it's primarily actually on the macro situation. Yes. Look, I think on the BIOSECURE Act, we see normal -- people are looking at their supply chains, and that's positives and negatives around the globe. As you see that one of the areas that we've seen from that is actually we see a benefit on our service business as we relocate laboratories in some cases and get them up and running quickly with our services on that one. So, definitely some exposure to CDMO, but I would say not the overall macro side on it. And then I think the second part, Bob, I don't know if you want to take that one? In fact, Bob, I would say our scale and service there really makes it a differentiator where we can scale with customers and get them up and running very, very quickly. We take the competition very seriously. But we've always had competition in China, and we continue to keep a focus on that. Maybe I'll kick it off a bit at a high level. I think, first of all, we participate in excellent markets with multiple long-term growth drivers. You look at the characterization that's going to be needed in biotherapeutics in time, improving human health. Quality of our Food is really going to be a continued growth driver for the Company. I would say there's a lot of growth factors within the business that in adjacent markets where we continue to invest in those opportunities. You've seen part of Biopharma, PFAS. And I do believe NASD long term is going to continue to grow. In our service business, we expect that to grow high single digits over the long term as we increase our attach rate, which is not a small point because every percentage increase in attach rate is about $30 million incremental on that side. So overall, I think we're in extremely durable long-term markets. On the China story, we're going to see probably getting down to more mature level growth rates in China, but I would remind everybody that there are secular drivers in China that continue to come up and the government continues to invest in science and technology, but also the scale of the country being so large, we benefit tremendously from the aftermarket element consumable and service around that and being able to kind of drive attachment to some of the emerging workflows. So, Bob, I don't know if you have anything to add on that? Yes. Look at it, I think it's hard to put a number on the extended deal time. It depends actually on the platform and portfolio. So, there's quite a big difference between, for example, GC and LCMS on that. But what I would say, in general, the deal time is prolonged. The win rates, of course, haven't changed. They're still very, very strong, but that deal time is prolonged. And I think if you look at it in the second half when we're looking at the visibility of what we're seeing in the funnel, the best thing and we're doing is staying close to customers on this one, making sure we're there to help them, of course, with their decisions and help them get up and running when they make the decision to purchase on it. So, we're going to see this continued extended deal time, I think, through the end -- through the second half. Yes. I think just to close off, Bob, I think the deal closure time lines remain at an elevated but very stable level. They're not deteriorating further, which I think is a really good sign. And in terms of the funnel is stable, no cancellations within that, which, of course, is very important to see. Yes, I would say it's a continuing evolving conversation. Clearly, on the NASD side, we've seen an impact from the IRA something we're watching closely, but I think this will evolve over time. What we're seeing in terms of programs-based around pricing provisions, there definitely has been an impact on that side. I don't know if you want to take that one, Bob. Yes. Maybe starting on the stimulus. This is an extremely large program, a multiyear program. It's very real. We've seen some of the customers with activity is asking us to bid and some of the things, even though they're not sure exactly yet how the mechanisms would work. So that gives us great confidence for '25 just from that. But I said earlier, also the indirect impact of confidence in science and technology in China. It's a real photo confidence by the government in making sure we -- making sure to get the market going again. So, I think in -- we saw meaningful softness extend to all markets because remember, the stimulus is not only academia and government, it's across all markets. And that has really come at once. And we did see at the end of the quarter, we also started to see customers postpone purchasing decisions have told us, right, sort of said we're going to postpone and they try to gauge if there's any benefit of the stimulus-related funding, and that's normal. I think that's expected. If you didn't see that, then the stimulus would have different questions. And why we believe that a stimulus program will ultimately be long-term positive, we really don't see any benefit in H2, and that's why we're roughly reducing by $70 million. Yes. What we're seeing is a postponement, and I think it's really too early to tell on the funnel side on -- if the customers are still working out the mechanisms about how it works, we're still waiting to see on the impact on the panel, particularly for '25, it's too early to tell. Bob, do you want to take this one? Yes, I would say before we get on to the long term, Bob, for Biopharma, really tough compare was mid-teens, plus mid-teens last year on that side. But what we're seeing is the long-term prospect for this market is very strong. You mean in the space itself. Yes. Well, I think there's long memories. So, people don't forget the elevated pricing for assets, but we're going to remain very disciplined. It's going to become an increasingly bigger part of the puzzle for us M&A, but we're going to make sure that we do it in a very disciplined way, link to strategy and of course, looking at areas of where we can double down and growth factors. So we're very focused on that going forward. But I would say, while pricing maybe has come down in little areas across the board, people have long memories."

            "name": "Bob McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Padraig, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then cover our updated full year and third quarter guidance. Q2 revenue was $1.573 billion. a decline of 7.4% core. On a reported basis, currency had a negative impact of 0.8 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 0.2%, resulting in a reported decline of 8.4%. As Padraig mentioned, Pharma, our largest end market, declined 11%, with both Biopharma and Small Molecule declining roughly the same percentage. Instrument demand continues to be constrained, while services delivered mid-single-digit growth. Looking forward, while we have seen sentiment improve, instrument purchases are still constrained and we are expecting that to continue for the rest of the year. In addition, we have reduced our expectations for NASD as several clinical programs have pushed out into next year and some commercial products have not ramped at the pace as expected. As a result, we have reduced our full year growth outlook for the Pharma end market from roughly flat to down low double digits, similar to our Q2 performance. Our revised expectation for the Pharma end market is the largest change in our outlook. The Chemical and Advanced Materials market was better than expected, declining 3% after coming off a very tough comparison of 16% growth last year. The academia and government market declined 12% against a tough compare of 11% growth last year. While soft globally, the decline was driven by China, which was down mid-30s. Our business in the Diagnostics and Clinical market declined 2%. Our pathology business continues to show resilience in this market, growing mid-single digits, while our NGS QC instrumentation business also grew slightly. These were offset by softness in our NGS chemistries business. The Environmental and Forensics market declined 2%. The business grew mid-single digits ex China, highlighted by continued strength in serving the rapidly expanding PFAS opportunity. The Food market declined 13% on a very tough compare of 21% growth last year, heavily impacted by the low 30s decline in China. On a geographic basis, all regions declined. The Americas region was down 5%. Europe was down 3%, while Asia Pacific ex China was down slightly. China was down 21%, missing our expectations of a mid-teens decline. We saw demand weakness expand beyond Pharma. As a result, we have revised our full year expectations for China for a mid-single-digit decline to a double-digit decline. We have seen funnel activity increase because of the recently announced stimulus program, but we are not assuming any revenue impact in our fiscal year. Moving down to P&L. Our second quarter gross margin was 55.6%, up 30 basis points from a year ago as productivity and cost savings were offset by lower demand and mix. Our operating margin of 25.1% was down year-over-year as expected. Below the line, we benefited from greater-than-expected interest income and a lower tax rate. Our tax rate was 12.5%, and we had 293 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q2 earnings per share were $1.22, down 4% from a year ago, less than the decline in revenue and ahead of our expectations. Now let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $333 million in the quarter and we invested $103 million in capital expenditures as we continue our planned NASD expansion. We returned $299 million to shareholders in the quarter, $69 million through dividends and $230 million through repurchase shares, catching up on our anti-dilutive buying year-to-date. In summary, we met our expectations for the quarter our markets are recovering but at a slower pace than we anticipated. We are directing our energy towards high-growth opportunities and are committed to delivering value to our customers and our shareholders. Now on to our revised outlook for the year and our third quarter guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be in the range of $6.42 billion to $6.50 billion. This represents a decline of 6.0% to 4.9% on a reported basis and a decline of 5.4% to 4.3% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 60 basis points. This is a $300 million reduction at the midpoint and is primarily related to changes in two areas: China overall in the Pharma end market outside of China. For China, we have reduced our expectations to a double-digit decline from mid-single digits with all end markets being reduced. This represents roughly $70 million of the guidance reduction. The remainder of the change in the Pharma end market globally outside of China is due to two factors. The first and largest factor is continued caution in budget releases and extended approval times for instrumentation purchases in both Small and Large Molecules. This is roughly $175 million of the change. The second factor is related to NASD due to the reasons I mentioned earlier, and represents the remaining $55 million reduction. While down from our previous guidance, we are expecting growth in the second half of the year to be roughly 400 basis points better than the first half of the year and plan to exit the year roughly flat year-on-year at the midpoint of the new guidance. Full year non-GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be between $5.15 and $5.25, representing a decline of 5.3% to 3.5%. This incorporates a roughly $35 million expense reduction due to the actions Padraig mentioned. The majority hit in Q4 in order to help mitigate the bottom-line impact of the change to our revenue guidance. It also assumes a 13% tax rate and 292 million fully diluted shares outstanding. We will leverage our strong balance sheet and plan to repurchase $750 million of our shares in the second half of the year in addition to our anti-dilutive repurchases. We expect these repurchases to be weighted towards Q3. All told, we expect to return roughly $1.4 billion to shareholders this year between dividends and share repurchases. In addition, the Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program that will go into effect August 1 and replace the existing authorization. Now for our Q3 guidance, we expect revenue will be in the range of $1.535 billion to $1.575 billion. This represents a decline of 8.2% to 5.8% on a reported basis and a decline of 6.9% to 4.5% on a core basis. Currency and M&A combined were a headwind of 130 basis points. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be between $1.25 and $1.28, representing a decline of 12.6% to 10.5%. Looking forward, we remain disciplined. We're focusing on what we can control and driving strong execution in a challenging market, and we are optimistic about the long-term future. Now back to Padraig. Yes. I think, Matt, as you said, we're still expecting improvement in the back half of this year, just not at the pace that we had expected. And so, we're not seeing any material extension of kind of the use case for LC or an LC/MS in the marketplace and are still expecting recovery in '25. Yes, I think Jack to add some numbers to what Padraig was saying here. Originally, we were expecting it to be roughly flat, which would have said roughly a $350 million business. We're now seeing roughly $300 million this year. As Padraig is mentioning, we're expecting to build back from there as these clinical programs move through the clinical pathway and are expecting to have more volume in '25. And I would say our long-term perspective on NASD remains unchanged. We're still very excited about that opportunity and are still building out the capacity in our Colorado site. Yes, it is incremental to the savings that we've already built into the plan, and we're expecting to get that annualized savings by the end of the year. It's primarily headcount-related, Jack. Yes. I think, Patrick, to build on what Padraig is saying at the beginning of the year, we were expecting when we were talking primarily to our Pharma customers, budgets weren't being materially cut outside of a specific number of well-publicized customers. And we were expecting to see by our second quarter, some of these budgets being released. And what we're seeing now is still a very cautious environment. And so, the funnel is still there. We are seeing our book-to-bill as Padraig mentioned, to be greater than one. We just haven't seen that inflection, which we would have expected to see at least in our order book. One of the things that we do see and it primarily happened late in the quarter is our teams are paid on first half versus second half quota. And so, our April numbers are usually quite large, which prepares us for the -- for Q3 and we just didn't see that inflection in late April, which we normally would see. Yes. Patrick, just one other thing to add on to that as I'm sure you're aware, as part of that expansion, not only are we expanding capacity, we're also expanding our therapeutic options. So, not only siRNA but also anti-sense and also CRISPR opportunity. So, it also provides us with more capabilities to support our existing and new client base. Vijay, to build on what Padraig is saying, the guidance that we're building out right now is based on what we're seeing today. It doesn't assume any meaningful inflection. That certainly -- I'd characterize this as a prudent guide given what we know today. Certainly, we're not assuming any of that inflection. You bring up a number of variables, which are hard to quantify around the upcoming election and so forth. But we don't think it's a funding issue. We do feel like we are seeing biotech funding coming up. Obviously, on the Small Molecule side, those are they're well-capitalized companies. It's just a very -- it's still cautious in terms of them getting through their approval processes. Let me answer the last question first. So that is a cumulative number for the second half of the year. We'll see some of that happen here in Q3 and roughly be at that $100 million run rate in Q4. So roughly about a $25 million run rate and then we'll get the full incremental 65, obviously, next year as we go into the business. Do you want to comment? Dan, this is Bob. To build on that, I had mentioned in our prepared remarks that bid activity has actually improved. And so, we're seeing a number of proposals working with our customers to actually get a piece of the stimulus. What's not yet clear is the timing of the release of that budget comes from the provincial -- or from the state down to the provincial and then to the local government. And so, we've taken a, what I would say, is a conservative approach to assuming none of that stimulus money will actually -- we'll see any of that in the second half of the year. But it will come, it will come. And so -- if it comes earlier, that would be a benefit to what we're forecasting right now. But we're -- what we did see, particularly in April is a little slowing down of normal bid process waiting to get access to that money. And so, we think that, that's just a transitory change, not a structural change. Yes. And Dan, just to kind of build on what Padraig had said. We looked at ACG and our CSD or our consumables business outside of China, both of those grew mid- to high single digits in the quarter. So, it does speak to lab activity. They're not having instruments just sitting idle. And in ACG, our contracted services business continues to perform extraordinarily well, up double digits. So, the demand is there outside of China right now. Yes. I would say just a building on that point on our questions around CDMO, most of our business in China is local. So, it's not multinational and so wouldn't necessarily fall under the BIOSECURE Act. There are certain large companies that are on that list that are customers of ours, but that is that business has been pretty muted for a while, and that's not the cause of the incremental weakness here. I would say on the bid activity, it's about -- it's across the board. It's not in one region of the country or one end market or customers and obviously, Chinese local competitors are going to be buying for that business like we are. But I think we've shown time and time again our ability to provide very strong and robust instrumentation, coupled with very good service. And so, I don't think that we're in any disadvantage from a local perspective from that standpoint. Sure. I'll take that real quick. By business group, we're expecting LSAG to be down double-digits DGG down mid-single and ACG growing at mid-single digits. If we looked at by end market, Pharma, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, would be down very similar to Q2, so down low double digits. And with academia and diagnostics markets being roughly flat, Chemical and Advanced Materials being very similar to Q2 results. And then Food being down roughly the same, maybe a little better than where we saw Q2 as well. And then Environmental and Forensics similar performance as Q2. Yes, I would just say, as we think about kind of our long-term algorithm that we've been talking about, that 5% to 7%, we're not ready to walk away from that. I think we still feel good about that. And I think while you talked about some of the bad guys, we still believe in Biopharma and are continuing to invest there. In addition, Padraig mentioned a few things on the applied side where we are the undisputed leader. So, things like PFAS, the electrification, semiconductors, those things weren't there five years ago to the extent that they're going to be there in the next five years. So certainly, the markets are a bit challenging right now, but we are seeing them recover, and we would expect to be able to get back to those rates in the near term. Yes. Thanks, Doug. And I think it is visibility. I think if you looked across the last seven years, the two most volatile years have been the last two. And so, I think we were expecting based on the feedback that we got from our customers that they would be releasing budgets much more quickly than what they have or at least what we're seeing and while we did have an expectation that we were going to see an inflection in the back half of this year, when we're talking to our customers, it just hasn't happened. And so, I think the visibility is something that I think will we will get back, particularly as we have more recurring revenue and continue to have the connect rate on to the services business. And we're disappointed as everyone else is, but you can rest assured that we're going to come out of this stronger going forward. Yes. I think if we look at just first half, second half and look at where our core guidance is, it's not assuming any inflection in the back half. I mean you could make an argument that typically, we have a higher weighting towards the back half of the year, just part of normal seasonality, and we're not assuming that in our guide. And so, if you look at also Pharma, we're assuming it's down roughly the same as it's been in the first half of the year, but we'll get easier compares. And so, we're not expecting \"a big inflection in the back half of the year.\" I would say also on NASD, which we are assuming a reduction in the second half of the year relative to the first half of the year, we have all those orders in-house. And so, we've got a plan, a production plan and both for Q3 and Q4. And while something could happen, it's not like we're looking for orders to guide us on those. And those are the two big areas that made the biggest change when I think about where we were back in November, giving guidance to where we are today. Yes. The biggest change there is our NASD business, which we will see a low water point here in Q3 if we -- what we ended up seeing is some of these clinical programs getting pushed out. They've got pushed out from Q3 into Q4. And so, there's a $30 million incremental step-up from Q3 to Q4. So, if you took that out, we did get back to a more historical kind of level. Yes. Dan, I wish I could say we have all the orders in-house for the second half for instruments. It just doesn't work that way. So, we have much better visibility into Q3, but we will need continued performance in Q3. Now we've had several quarters here of book-to-bills being greater than one in our instrumentation portfolio, which is a positive thing. I would say, hey, we're building some backlog. And as Padraig mentioned earlier in the call, particularly in LSAG. LSAG orders grew ex-China. And that is the first time that's happened in several quarters. So, we are seeing some positives and if you look at the second half of the year, our performance relative to last year should improve just because of the benefit of easier compares. And so -- we're not, again, looking for that huge inflection. And we're not expecting also as Padraig was saying, a constriction, so to speak, or an acceleration of those deal funnels. We're expecting them to stay very similar to the way they are right now. Yes, I'll take it. So, I wouldn't characterize it, Josh, is a deterioration. It actually just wasn't the inflection or the acceleration that we were expecting. We did -- as we were saying here, we did have a positive book-to-bill and ex China orders grew. They just didn't grow to the extent that we expected them to, particularly in April, which we would typically have higher acceleration just kind of given the end of the quarter. In terms of the platform, what you're seeing is the platforms that are more focused on Pharma being the areas that are the weakest. So, LC and LC/MS are weaker than the applied markets. And you can kind of see that in our end markets as well. And so, we were expecting those to kind of perform better this year, and we're just still seeing that, I'd say, lower-than-expected performance from the standpoint of order velocity. I would say -- sorry, just one quick -- so one thing I would say, though, is if I looked at the performance, the revenue performance versus the order performance, the order performance was significantly better in Q2 on those two main platforms than the revenue. So again, these are points that says we are getting out of it, maybe not at the pace that we were expecting. So -- and so those are some positive points that would suggest that we're going to continue to -- it's not going to deteriorate coming out in Q2 -- or excuse me, in second half. Sorry. LC and LC/MS. So yes. Yes. Yes, it was both government and non-government accounts across the board. So, I would say it was pretty broad beyond Pharma. Yes. So, our LSAG business declined 13% globally, ex-China, it was down 8%. It's roughly 45%. Long term or in the quarter? Yes. So, if we looked at our Biopharma business, it was down roughly 12%, Small Molecule was down roughly 10%. Total Pharma was down 11%. So, it kind of gives you a sense. I think."

Before I review our first quarter results, I want to first acknowledge our news last week that I will be retiring at the end of the fiscal year and that Padraig McDonnell is Agilent's new Chief Operating Officer and will become CEO on May 1. It was a difficult decision to retire after almost 40 great years with this special company and in the role that I love, I will miss working with the One Agilent team. However, I must say it's a great feeling and quite gratifying to be handing over the CEO reins to a tremendously capable successor in Padraig. With Agilent operating from a position of strength and with a very promising long-term outlook. I have known Padraig for more than 20 years. I've worked closely with him during that time. He has always been completely committed to our customers and Agilent's success. He is a product of our culture, knows our company, team and markets and those have developed compelling business strategies, build winning teams and deliver exceptional results. Padraig has a strong track record result at every position he has held during his 26-year career at Agilent. I know he has the knowledge, leadership skills and customer focus that will be key to Agilent's success moving forward. I look forward to all of you seeing first-hand what a capable result driven leader we have in Padraig. Padraig would you like to say a few words?\nPadraig McDonnell: Thank you, Mike. I'm honored to be able to follow you as Agilent's next CEO and I'm grateful for your support throughout my career and during this transition. You have made a significant impact on Agilent, our customers and our team. I'd also like to welcome Angelica Riemann to this call. After leading our services division for the last 2.5 years, I can tell you she has the experience and the skill set to continue evolving ACG to align with the growing opportunities that the business has demonstrated in supporting the broad installed base and our enterprise customers. Expect to see continued great things ahead from Angelica and ACG. I've had the pleasure of meeting some of you on this call and I look forward to meeting and working with you all in the future. Agilent has a compelling story to tell and I'm excited by the possibilities that lie in front of us as we help our customers bring great signs to life.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Padraig. For today's call, I will take lead, covering the overview of our financial results, while next quarter, Padraig will take on these duties as the new CEO. Now, on to the Q1 results. We are pleased with the start of the year. The Agilent team continues its strong execution in a challenging market environment. The first quarter provided further evidence of our team's capabilities with revenue coming in better than expected at $1.66 billion. This represents a decline of 6.4% against a tough compare of 10% growth in Q1 of last year. The better-than-expected top line results and disciplined cost management drove higher-than-expected earnings per share of $1.29 down 6% from Q1 last year. Given the solid Q1 results and our continued view is slow but steady recovery throughout the year, we are maintaining our full year outlook that we shared with you in November. Key to our Q1 performance was the ongoing sequential stabilization we experienced in China and secular growth drivers in applied markets globally. From an end market perspective, our total pharma business is down 12% which was in line with our expectations. This falls 11% increase in the first quarter last year. While declining overall against a very strong Q1 of last year, our applied end markets were more resilient than expected and show sequential growth from the fourth quarter. In these markets, PFAS Solutions and Advanced Materials, including batteries and semiconductors were high bits for us. Geographically, both China and Europe finished Q1 better than expected, while revenue for the Americas was in line with expectations. Looking at performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenues of $846 million and down 11%. This is against a difficult compare of 10% growth last year. While still too early to call an overall market recovery, results were better than expected. Our diversified portfolio and broad end market coverage helped drive the performance. We continue to experience a conservative environment for capital spending. But are better than expected, Q1 results were driven by consumables which grew mid-single digits, China and a better-than-expected performance in applied markets. During the quarter, we also completed the expansion of our Shanghai manufacturing facility as we continue to take steps to ensure our long-term leadership in China. We also made our first customer shipments for Agilent's newly released LC/MS offerings. Our latest highest sensitivity triple quad, the 6495D enables expanded and enhanced workflows, including for PFAS. This, in addition to Revident, the first of a new generation of LC/Q-TOF systems that combine a new architecture with enhanced instrument intelligence for maximize operation time and productivity. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $405 million. This is up 5% with growth across all regions except China. Our contracts business led the way with double-digit growth overall, led by strength in enterprise service contracts. This performance highlights the continued strength and resiliency of our business. Connect rates for both services and consumables continue to improve. This is a result of our focused strategy to deliver end-to-end customer value while also building a larger recurring revenue business. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $407 million, down 6% core. Our pathology-related businesses and our NGS QC portfolio grew mid-single digits which was more than offset by declines in NGS chemistries and NASD. NASD declined low double digits as expected. This is because a very tough compare of 22% growth driven by significant volume last year from a single commercial program. We continue to be encouraged with our long-term prospects due to the increasing number of programs across a range of indications many of them target large patient populations. The DGG team continues to innovate and deliver differentiated solutions for our customers. In the quarter, we induced a new ProteoAnalyzer system. The new platform simplifies and improves the efficiency of analyzing complex protein mixtures. And processes that are central to analytical workflows across the pharma, biotech, food analysis and academia sectors. From an overall Agilent perspective, we recently achieved World Economic Forum recognition for operations of Waldbronn, Germany. This site was named a Global Lighthouse for implementing innovation that boost productivity, output and quality. This marks the second Global Lighthouse award for us after seeing the recognition for our Singapore facility two years ago. Agilent is the only life science tools company to be recognized as a Global Lighthouse. Agilent recently achieved a top 5 ranking in the Barron's list of 100 most sustainable companies. In addition, we are included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index globally and in North America for the ninth year in a row. Looking ahead, we expect the current market environment to persist through the first half, we expect a slow and steady improvement in the second half of the year. We will continue taking actions that will make us stronger and position us well for the future. We will maintain our approach to prioritize investing for growth with a focus on execution and driving productivity. Our better-than-expected Q1 results and my confidence the Agilent team reinforced our view for the full year. Bob will now provide the details on our results as well as our outlook for Q2. After Bob's comments, I will rejoin for some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you.\nRobert McMahon: Thanks, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our second quarter guidance. Q1 revenue was $1.66 billion, a decline of 6.4% core. On a reported basis, currency added 0.9 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 0.1%, resulting in a reported decline of 5.6%. And overall, orders were greater than revenue in Q1 as expected. As Mike mentioned, pharma, our largest end market declined 12%. Within pharma, biopharma declined low single digits but grew low single digits outside China, bolstered by strength in services and consumables. Small molecule was down high teens in the quarter with softness globally. The chemical and advanced materials market was down 4% off a very tough comparison of 14% growth last year. We saw broad resilience in advanced materials with a low single-digit increase year-on-year as well as growth sequentially. Given the extremely tough compare of high 20s growth last year, these are impressive results. As expected, the chemical side saw a decline. The academia and government market was up 2%. The growth in this market reflects the stability of academic funding and lab activity. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market declined 5%, mid-single-digit growth in pathology was more than offset by continued headwinds in genomics, cell analysis and LC and LC/MS. The environmental and forensics market declined 1% after growing 12% in Q1 of last year. We continue to see new regulations around the world driving PFAS testing. Europe grew mid-single digits, while China and the Americas were down low single digits. Americas faced a difficult compare of low 30s growth last year. The food market declined 3% but was up low single digits, excluding China. On a geographic basis, as Mike mentioned, both China and Europe exceeded our expectations while the Americas were in line with our expectations. China was down 9% and showed a sequential increase over last quarter which was much better than expectations. China benefited from continued stabilization and a bigger-than-expected Lunar New Year impact as some customers pulled forward incremental demand from Q2. We estimate the pull-forward impact to be roughly $15 million or 5% of China's revenue in the quarter. Even adjusting for this impact, China outperformed. Europe was down 4% year-on-year after growing 10% last year and was up mid-single digits sequentially. This was driven by continued strong demand for our ACG services, offset by muted demand in pharma and expected softness in chemicals. In the Americas, revenue was down 8% due to declines in pharma and the softness in NASD and NGS chemistries. Moving down the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.0% down 50 basis points from a year ago as productivity and cost savings were offset by lower demand and mix. Our operating margin of 25.8% was down year-over-year as expected. Our ongoing cost savings initiatives are delivering as planned. Below the line, we benefited from greater-than-expected interest income in the quarter, driven by nice work from our treasury team, coupled with very strong cash flow. Our tax rate was 13.5% and we had 294 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q1 earnings per share were $1.29, down 6% from a year ago and ahead of our expectations. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. I continue to be very pleased with our cash flow generation. Operating cash flow was $485 million in the quarter, significantly above last year. In Q1, we invested $90 million in capital expenditures as we continue our planned NASD expansion. And during the quarter, we returned $69 million to shareholders through dividends. Although no shares were repurchased during the quarter, we expect to catch up on our anti-dilutive share repurchasing for the remainder of the year. In Q2, we expect a minimum of $180 million to be repurchased. All in all, we had a good start to the year. And as Mike mentioned, it reinforces our confidence in the full year guide we provided in November. Now, to our guidance for the second quarter. We expect Q2 revenue will be in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion. This represents a decline of 9.1% to 7.4% on a reported basis and a decline of 8.4% to 6.7% on a core basis against 9% growth last year. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 70 basis points. Our Q2 guidance also reflects the $15 million impact of the Q1 pull forward in China I mentioned earlier. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $1.17 and $1.20. Before turning back over to Mike, I just want to express my thanks to Mike and to congratulate Padraig. Mike, it has been a real pleasure to work with you. While there have been many ups and downs in the markets these past few years, one thing I knew I could always count on is your steady leadership and strong partnership. And Padraig, congratulations again. I'm really looking forward to working with you. And now, I'll turn things back over to Mike. Mike?\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Bob. Today marks my 37th and final earnings call with all of you. Time does truly fly by. I want to first thank you for your support and engagement over the years. I have to say it has been a tremendous honor serving as Agilent's CEO and represent the achievements of the One Agilent team to all of you and the broader investor community. In 2015, we launched the then new Agilent with a goal to transform Agilent into a leading life science and diagnostics company. We had ambitious goals to drive long-term shareholder value creation with significantly stepped up financial results delivered by an unmatched One Agilent team working together in a truly differentiated and compelling company culture. I couldn't be proud of the Agilent team and what we've accomplished together over the last 9 years. While current market conditions remain challenging, the long-term promise of growth remains with end markets power buying investments to improve the human condition. On the Agilent front, we've never been in a stronger position to continue to capitalize on opportunities to serve our customers within the market and deliver differentiated financial results. It's been a pleasure to work with all of you over the years. I will miss it. While at the same time, I know that you will enjoy working with Padraig in the years ahead. Like me, I know you'll be impressed with Padraig's knowledge of our industry and our business. As I noted earlier, he knows how to develop compelling business strategies, build winning teams and deliver exceptional results. His track record of success during his Agilent leadership journey speaks for itself and have no doubt, it will continue in his new role. While this is my last earnings call with you, I'm certain that the best is yet to come for Agilent. Thank you. And now over to you, Parmeet for the Q&A.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thanks, Mike. Regina, if you could please provide instructions for Q&A now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.\nDerik De Bruin: Congratulations, Mike. And good luck. So first question, we've been getting a lot of incomings on the NASD business. And just because the growth trajectory is not doing what I think what people had thought it was going to do this year. I assume there's a couple of questions. It's like, look, there's been some pushouts in some clinical readouts from Alnylam with their HELIOS-B trial, there's been some other sort of like developments in the market. I guess the question is like, are you still confident that, that segment can grow this year, NASD can grow this year? And I just -- is there any risk at all that there's like an overcapacity situation because as the market -- is it just taking longer for things to catch up? Just sort of your thoughts on that, please?\nMike McMullen: I'll tag team with Bob on this. So as you saw in our prepared remarks, Q1 came in as expected for the NASD business. And we are in a situation where we've had, I think, the broadest number of clinical programs and such. So we're very active. The volume is less commercial this year as we pointed out in the script as well versus clinical. And Bob, I know we've been talking a lot with the team about the outlook for the year, particularly with some of our customers who are resequencing some of the clinical programs into '25.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. Derik. And as you're talking about, we remain very optimistic about the future of NASD, our forecast for Train C and D remains intact in terms of building out the expansion. I would say that as we're talking about things, you mentioned one of the clinical trials. That's an important element of one of our customers. We are seeing some potential pushouts into FY '25. And as they are looking at revisiting the clinical trial programs and time lines and it's probably closer to flat this year based on that, although we're not giving up hope but that's built into kind of keeping our guide the way it is. But I think if you look at the number of commercial programs -- or excuse me, clinical programs that we have, we're very excited about the future.\nMike McMullen: And Bob, I think it's also fair to say that this is not a byproduct of overcapacity in the industry or a significant change in in-sourcing. It's really how some of our customers are reacting to really the IRAC.\nRobert McMahon: That's right.\nDerik De Bruin: Well, that takes me -- that's a great segue into my next question which is what's sort of the latest on pharma? It doesn't sound like you're ready to call an inflection point but it does sound like things sounded a little bit better. Can you just sort of give your thoughts on what budget releases are sort of timing around that? Any sort of like notable developments? I mean, when do you -- are you seeing any sort of like signs of life that -- or the signs of budgets could start to be released in the second quarter?\nMike McMullen: Yes. Great question, Derik. Obviously, top of mind, within Agilent, as we mentioned, Q1 came in where we thought it would. But what's the outlook? And Padraig, I know you've just spending a lot of time with your team and customers talking about this exact question.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. Thanks, Mike. And I think customers continue to be cautious globally. I think as we're stable -- what we're seeing a stability but no material improvement versus what we saw in the last half of last year. And in terms of the capital budget cycle in '24, this is the time we see it. It's pretty early in that cycle. But we've heard move in both directions, positive and negative but fewer customers expecting negative budgets. So we're watching and seeing how that goes.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think what you shared with me earlier, Padraig, was the tone was more negative at this time last year. It's still not super positive yet and still a lot of caution but we're not seeing anything to cause us to change our outlook for the year. I think Bob -- thank you very much. I think, Bob, you had one.\nRobert McMahon: Yes, I was just going to say one of the things that we see is very strong performance in our services and our consumables business in the pharma sector which actually speaks to lab activity. And so while we've seen a depressed capital cycle here and we're optimistic about that turning around in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Matt Sykes with Goldman Sachs.\nMatt Sykes: Maybe just to start out, maybe bigger picture in China. It sounded like you made some comments about sequential improvement. It sounds like it's informing some of your confidence for back half. What are the risks that China just simply doesn't get worse and just kind of bounce along the bottom. And what kind of catalysts are you looking for in China for the back half for some level of improvement? I know it's not necessarily baked in your guide but you did make some comments about some sort of nascent optimism there potentially?\nMike McMullen: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Matt. And as we had a really, I think, a nice print to start off the year. A big part of that was the performance in China. Yes, we had a bit of a pull-in from Q2 from Lunar New Year but the business overall was better than expected. And to answer your question, we now have several quarters real orders, real revenue and the sequential growth, the numbers are real. So we're not seeing anything on the macro world that would also dramatically change what has continued to be a very challenging economic market in China. So what gives us confidence is the fact that we've had a number of quarters now, our predictability in the business. The numbers are coming in slightly better than we had anticipated. But again, I think it's more just the fact that there's ongoing run rate of business that gives us confidence on the outlook. And Bob, I know that you want to jump in on this one Padraig?\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. And I think if, Matt, as you just mentioned, we aren't assuming any inflection in our guide. That's been consistent. Actually, Q1 ended up being a little better than we anticipated. We kind of putting that money in the bank, so to speak. And if you look at it, we'll have now quarters of numbers that are relatively stable which is a very positive sign. And I think when we look at our funnel, it's also stable as well as the order funnel -- order forecast is what Mike just talked about as well.\nMatt Sykes: And then maybe just on ACG which had a good quarter. You talked about the contract revenue and specifically enterprise services. With that growth, maybe could you just help kind of size that contract business within ACG? And then maybe talk about what is driving that growth? And what kind of contribution can that make to the ACG segment over the course of this year?\nMike McMullen: Matt, thanks for your support of the ACG business over the years. And I want to use this opportunity to introduce our new ACG Group President. But first, I'd like to maybe have a two-part response probably and Bob, I think it's roughly about 65% just to make sure. So roughly about 65% of our total services business is in the contracts arena. And Angelica, maybe you could share your thoughts on really what's been driving the growth we're seeing in that contract business.\nAngelica Riemann: Yes. Thanks, Mike. As you mentioned, it's about 65% of the total business. And a part of that demand has really been driven by the lab-wide enterprise services offerings, where we're able to help customers as they're navigating their own economic situation really helping them optimize their entire lab operation. And our portfolio offerings in this stage have allowed us to really facilitate that improvement in lab operations, lab efficiency and that's particularly important to those enterprise customers.\nMike McMullen: And in times of tough economic times, the market times, the productivity help and driving productivity in the labs as a well-received offering we have.\nRobert McMahon: Matt, just one other quick thing on that. One of the great things that Angelica and team have been doing and you heard us talk about this a lot is about the increasing of the attach rate and that continues to grow at roughly 1 point again year-on-year this year. And that kind of locks in that resiliency of that stability in that business. And if you think about a 2/3 of that business growing double digits, it really helped power the business and when we see the inevitable turnaround of the instrument business, that will be a nice tailwind as well.\nMike McMullen: So, absolutely, Bob.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.\nBrandon Couillard: So the chemical and advanced materials business, we actually performed a little better than we were expecting. Obviously, you're still seeing some headwinds in the chemical side. Just give us your state of the union there, what you're seeing from a macro's perspective and kind of outlook for that business moving into the second half look like?\nMike McMullen: Yes. So I'll do a tag team on this with Padraig. So as you may recall, we've talked earlier this year about these secular growth drivers in the applied markets. And we saw that pretty much across the globe. And I think what we're seeing again is the investments being made in advanced materials relative to the semiconductor supply chain and also the fab is driving productivity. We're seeing continued investment relative to battery, battery development, QA/QC. And I think we continue to see some real nice growth in the PFAS side of our environmental business. Started in the U.S., I think all those applied market secular drivers that we've been pointing to for, for some time, delivered in Q1. And I think our outlook remains the same that we're expecting there'll be a source of positivity for us in the overall CAM [ph] market space, albeit the chemical market is expected to remain subdued.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. That's right, Mike. I think it's really a tale of two submarkets. We saw broad resilience in the advanced materials with sequential growth. And given the extremely tough compare and high 20s we had last year, it was truly a very impressive result from the teams. The chemical and energy side was -- we saw a decline but on a very tough compare of 10% but we did see a sequential improvement versus Q4 '23. Overall, I think our portfolio is extremely strong in this area. We have ability to cross and upsell across that. And of course, our strong services offerings have that value proposition.\nBrandon Couillard: And then, Bob, in terms of the guide for the year, I mean, you're sticking with the organic growth range for the year, you beat the first quarter. This China pull forward, then explain all of the upside in the first quarter what the NASD outlook is lower, what other moving parts by end market or geography kind of gets you to the same midpoint?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. That's a great question, Brandon. And you talked about a couple of them. We feel really good about where we started the year. It's still at the beginning of the year, though, so we're kind of banking some of that. What I would say is if you looked across the moving pieces, with the NASD being slightly lower, that would be offset by a little better results in the LSAG side of the business. And really, that chemical and advanced materials and academia are two areas that are probably slightly better than what we had forecasted. But overall, we're maintaining the guide and as we are looking here felt good about really at the start to the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners.\nPuneet Souda: So my first question is really around maybe, I think Bob, you talked a little bit about the book-to-bill orders growing faster than revenue. But maybe could you elaborate a bit on more on the instrumentation side, what you're seeing and what you're seeing with the respect to book-to-bill in China? And a quick question, a clarifying question on the 2Q guide. It does look a slight step down versus Q1. And I just want to make sure beyond the Lunar New Year? What else are you baking in there?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. I'll take that. There are a lot of questions in that one question. But so true to form, Puneet and one of the things -- I'll start with the last one. I mean, we typically do have seasonality. There is that $15 million that gets pushed from one quarter to another; that's strictly timing in China because of the Lunar New Year. But Q2 is typically a lower revenue number. So we're building in that normal seasonality. In terms of book-to-bill in China, actually book-to-bill was greater than 1 in China; so continued stabilization. And in terms of book-to-bill for our instruments, it was below 1, are kind of expected. Now some of that was a result of the China pull forward where the orders came in and we were expecting that revenue to be shipped in Q2; so there's some element of timing there. But all in all, a positive start to the year.\nMike McMullen: Bob, if I cover headline on that, too, I'd just say that Q2 seasonality is as normal and the Q1 book-to-bill results are as our normal pattern. So again, we've been talking a lot about normalization of business flow. And I think we're seeing it in terms of the seasonal patterns and book-to-revenue situations.\nPuneet Souda: And then just a high-level question, or a simple question. Could you maybe elaborate a bit on the pharma side, where you're seeing more traction, more growth? Is it the large pharma, small biotechs, CROs, CDMOs. Maybe just talk a little bit about that.\nRobert McMahon: Yes, I'll take that, Puneet. If we look at across our business, the relative strength was actually in our biopharma. So a large molecule. And our business is skewed to the larger midsize and large cap companies. The standout has been the ACG business and our consumables on that. So it actually speaks to activity in the labs. We are starting to see -- I don't want to call it a trend but certainly a stabilization on the emerging biotech side of it. The instruments were still down but that is where we're starting to see the relative strength in the pharma business. And that speaks to kind of the long-term growth drivers, I think, in that market. And I would expect that to continue throughout the course of the year as our business gets stronger and the markets get stronger. And quite honestly, we have more favorable comps.\nMike McMullen: Bob, I think I recall correctly, outside of China, our biopharma business actually grew in the quarter.\nRobert McMahon: That's right.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rachel Vatnsdal with JPMorgan.\nRachel Vatnsdal: So first up, I just want to follow up there on a comments around book-to-bill. So you mentioned the book-to-bill for instrumentation was below 1 for the quarter and some of that was really timing related. So I guess, can you just break that down for us a little bit further. What trends are you seeing in liquid chromatography versus mass spectro for example? And then is there any dynamics or trends to call out from geography on the instrumentation business as well?\nMike McMullen: I don't think there's any new trends here. I think without going into the details of our product line, the small molecule side has really been in an area where we've talked about the year-on-year challenges there from the LC side. But Phil, I don't know if you want to jump in with any thoughts here but I don't think there's any real outstanding new trends here with perhaps the better-than-expected trends we saw in applied markets, particularly on advanced materials but maybe you have something else you want to add?\nPhil Binns: Yes, sure, Mike. I think that's pretty much the case similar to Q1 around how the markets are performing. We're seeing some bright spots around some of the secular areas in the applied markets, in the instrumentation which is driving the business forward but just support your comments there.\nRobert McMahon: Rachel, just one other thing to build on what Mike and Phil were just talking about. When we look at our LSAG business, it was down 11% which was better than what we expected. The piece that's really been driving that down is the pharma market which is what we've been expecting. If we looked at the rest of the markets, they were much better than the down 11% with the exception of the diagnostics and clinical which is a small number.\nMike McMullen: Right. And to your question, Rachel, that dynamic in the pharma really speaks to pressure on the LC business.\nRachel Vatnsdal: And then I just wanted to ask about monthly trends. Some of your peers have talked about how spending a bit, a little bit slow out of the gate in January and then into early February. So I guess, since you guys have a few more weeks of visibility here. Can you walk us through where you seeing similar trends on just slower spending to start the year? And has any of that started to come back? Any color there as we enter fiscal 2Q would be helpful.\nMike McMullen: Well, I've been in this business for a while and it's always slow in January. And that's why we have the seasonality we talked about relative to Q2. So I don't think we're seeing any significantly different trends that we've seen historically. Padraig, I know that you're closer than I am but [indiscernible].\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. No, I think that's right, Mike. I think on the ACG side, we see a number of service -- our service contract business comes in strong under the ACG side but on the capital side, we're not seeing much.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. And Bill, just a final -- put a finer point on that, January came in as we expected.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jordan [ph] on for Vijay. Maybe one follow-up on the China side. Have you seen any hints of stimulus to start the year? And if we do see a stimulus, do you have any foresight to what implications that will have on Agilent?\nMike McMullen: Both Padraig and I are in the conference and we're shaking our head, no. We've not heard anything about any potential stimulus. And what I can tell you is if it does happen, it's upside to our outlook.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. And then maybe one more for me. Can you talk about how pricing has trended in the quarter? And any updates to your expectations for the remainder of the year?\nMike McMullen: Bob, do you want to take that one?\nRobert McMahon: Yes. We were pleased with the results. It was between 1% and 2%. So but in line with kind of the seasonality and the mix that we saw, we would expect to see in Q1. So right now, it's on track. As we've talked about, our consumables business and ACG business have the greatest price realization followed by generally speaking, actually, we had a very good result in diagnostics and genomics in the quarter. And then we did see some mix but not anything out of the ordinary instrumentation side. So all in, we're on track for what we expected for the full year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi.\nPatrick Donnelly: Bob, maybe one for you first. Just in terms of the EPS guide. It looks like you guys got an additional $20 million on the kind of net interest other income. Can you just kind of flag if that's rolling through, did that core earnings number move a little lower? Is any moving pieces there? And then secondarily, just on the margin piece, you guys have that cost savings plan. Can you just talk about how that paces as the year goes, would be helpful.\nRobert McMahon: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Great question. And what I would say is a couple of things. We are on track to have more interest income than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year that $20 million and some of that in the first quarter as well and that's really a result of actually having better-than-expected cash flow in the first quarter and great work by the treasury team. I would say that the savings -- we're on track for the savings targets for the full year. And as I think about the year, it's still very early in the year and this provides us what I would say is more confidence in the guide.\nPatrick Donnelly: And then, maybe just on kind of the book-to-bill. How are you guys thinking about -- I think last quarter, you said the book-to-bill for the year would be above 1 but you'd have quarters kind of in and out on the instrument side which obviously we're seeing this quarter. How are you thinking about just the order trends and the book-to-bill trends on the instrument side as we work our way through the year given what you're seeing today?\nRobert McMahon: Yes, no change to what we said back in November. Q1 is a proof point for what we said.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with TD Cowen.\nDaniel Brennan: Maybe just going to beat the dead horse but just for the instruments, did you guys say -- I know in the Q, you usually put out what the instrument number actually was. So what did actually instruments do in the quarter? And then given how much easier comps go as we get through the year? Can you just kind of give us a sense of pacing like what should we expect on Q2 in instruments and then we can kind of have at the back half of the year?\nMike McMullen: I know the team did a calculation on that because LSAG was down 11% but that includes our consumables business which was up.\nRobert McMahon: Yes, I would say we typically don't give all that information but it was down -- we were down 11%. It was down, puts 20%, in the quarter but that was better than expected, offset by 6% growth in our consumables business. If we look at the LSAG thinking for Q2, it's down low teens. So -- and a lot of that has to do with some of the timing associated with that $15 million shift. That's almost all capital equipment from Q1 -- from Q2 back into Q1. So if you look at it, it is in line with where we expect it to be.\nMike McMullen: And then, we go into more favorable compares in Q3 and Q4.\nRobert McMahon: Correct, correct.\nDaniel Brennan: Got it. Okay. And then I know there's been a handful of questions running on China. But can you just -- would you mind spending a bit more color on kind of what maybe by segment, pharma, applied? Any color you can give us kind of what you're seeing within the different businesses in China? And is down mid-single still the expectation for China for the full year? Or is there a chance you can kind of see some upside for that number.\nMike McMullen: I think we've have raised it up a bit. It's still down...\nRobert McMahon: Yes, yes. I think we're cautiously optimistic there. I'd say it's still within a range that we had before, so I don't want to call an inflection. But if you looked at the markets we were down that 9% was roughly down 20%-ish [ph] in pharma. So that continues to be the area of really around the globe but China is no different. The great thing is many of the other markets performed much better. So even when you think about like academia and government, that grew, so did our chem and advanced material business now grew very low single digits. And then our forensics in environmental was down low single digits. So you're actually starting to see the continued stabilization and then you'll get into very much easier compares in the back half of the year in China because that down 22% was down compared to up 12% last year. We had another strong compare in Q2 and then we actually started seeing the pretty significant declines year-on-year. And so there's reasons to be optimistic about that continued stabilization that Mike talked about but we're not ready yet to call an inflection. But when it happens, we'll take it.\nMike McMullen: And Padraig, I know you want to jump in this as well.\nPadraig McDonnell: Yes. And I think what we see is as also consumables and services continue to outperform expectations in China, so that's kind of we expect that to continue.\nMike McMullen: Yes, I think the story is a great. I think the story really was in pharma, Q1, the instrument and the CapEx side of things. But we're pleased with the start there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird.\nCatherine Schulte: Maybe first, when pharma was down 12% in the quarter. I think you said biopharma was up 2% ex China. What was small molecule performance ex China. And maybe the outlook for biopharma versus a small molecule for the rest of the year?\nRobert McMahon: So small molecule on a global basis was down roughly 18%. And it was ex China, it was down 20% and down roughly 14% for China. So pretty consistent across the globe. I would say, in China, the big area in China that has been impacted is on the small molecule side, where we'll start to see better comps going forward after Q2.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay. And then maybe on consumables, it's great to see a return to growth there this quarter. Can you talk through what you saw outside of China on the consumables side?\nRobert McMahon: Our consumables business was pretty consistent across the globe in terms of growth.\nMike McMullen: So I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that on the -- or we've seen the consumables, I think we're really pleased to see that because it really speaks to the lab activity being robust. So anything else you want to jump in on with?\nPhil Binns: Yes. Probably just one item there, Mike. I think we are seeing really good traction around our workflow development. So end-to-end solutions which obviously is also drives our services business as well. But around the consumables, the -- in most of our end markets, we've been pretty heavily focused on developing workflows and making our customers' lives easier and more integrated in our labs and that's showing some really good traction and that's reflected in solid connected attach rates in the consumable space.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Phil. I'm really glad you close with the comments about connect rates. We talked about that relative to our services business, we're also seeing a very strong positive trend on consumables as well which bodes well to our future in terms of recurring revenue business growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Nephron Research.\nJack Meehan: Just had a couple of follow-ups. The first one was, could you just talk about what you're seeing in the genomics business within DGG. I know it's still been a bit of a drag. Just when do you think that's going to start to turn?\nMike McMullen: I think I'll invite Bob in on this one but I think it's been sort of a tale of two cities. When we talk about our genomics business, there's really two pieces to it. The half of it's in QA/QC activities for NGS workflows and we're seeing really solid growth in the consumables on that side of things as well as you're starting to see signs of life on the CapEx, not the current because the call churn there yet but that's in a reasonably good shape. I think we've seen really in our U.S.-based genomics business, some really market challenges have been hitting us. And Bob, maybe you can elaborate on that?\nRobert McMahon: That's right. Thanks, Mike. And as you said, our NGS QC portfolio from an instrument and consumable side actually grew mid-single digits in the quarter which was very nice. The genomics chemistry side that we referenced in the prepared remarks was down. We faced some very difficult comps. We had a couple of companies that reorganized and exited some businesses. They had some lifetime buys at the end of Q1. I would expect that the performance of that to improve starting in the second half of the year.\nJack Meehan: Great. And I also wanted to ask about the academic end market. I know that's been very stable for you guys. But just what you're seeing in the U.S. here with the continuing resolution for the NIH, just thoughts on the durability moving forward.\nMike McMullen: Yes, Jack, thanks for noticing that. That was a real bright spot for us. We actually grew, I think, 2% in the quarter. And this is -- we've been working on this thing for some time to really build out our portfolio and really change our market position in academia research and I think it's starting to show up in the numbers. I think stabilization really is what we're seeing which is the funding is there. And NIH is a relatively really small part of Agilent's business, so really is immaterial. But we're seeing universities have increasingly been funded through private sector. So the money is there. And even so, we saw money in China as well. So it was really a nice global story for us and we're fairly optimistic that, that kind of stabilization can be there for us for the rest of the year.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel with Wolfe Research.\nDoug Schenkel: I want to ask a question on guidance and then a question on capital deployment.\nMike McMullen: Surely, absolutely. Go ahead, Doug.\nDoug Schenkel: So for the year, on one hand, around 48% of sales is in the first half, at least that's how you've guided, I believe. Yes, that's lower than last year but it's not outside the norm for the last several years. On the other hand, just given some math, your guidance for the first half embeds the assumption that revenue declines around 7% organically and then improves 7% to 9% positive organic in the second half. Can you could do that just as a function of the comps? Or do you actually really need to see improvement in certain geographies or certain end markets or categories? And then again, just a math question. Does guidance assume Q4 revenue kind of exiting around like $1.8 billion?\nRobert McMahon: Doug, this is Bob. I'll take that last one. We'll tell you when we get to Q4 and what I would say but your math is -- in all seriousness, your math is spot on as usual. I think one of the things that we look at is, we look at it a couple of different ways. I think the way to look at it is that first half, second half kind of looking at seasonality, that's probably more instructive given kind of the changes in the growth rates. And when you look at it, as you noticed -- as you mentioned, it is in line with our historical seasonality. And when you look at the growth rates, you're right, we are expecting growth in the back half of the year. A lot of that is, in fact, the easier the compares. And when we actually look at -- what I would ask you to take a look at also is a 2-year stack basis relative to implied Q1 and first half and second half. And what you would see there is a much more smooth number that we also looked at as well. So as usual, you're spot on there.\nMike McMullen: And Bob, I think that's why we really emphasized in the script, the word stabilization because as things, as we have kind of a stabilization, we're going to get a lift in the growth rate just by the comps as they go.\nDoug Schenkel: Yes, I know there's a lot of focus on how much improvement is necessary to get there. So if a lot of this is stability is just math that I think obviously makes people more comfortable. I know I've taken up a lot of air time already. Real quick. Capital deployment, the cash flow remains robust. The balance sheet is super clean. Can you just talk about your thinking right now on capital deployment and what the environment looks like right now?\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think we remain very interested in deploying capital in a balanced way which is inclusive of investing for in the business. And that speaks directly to we are interested in M&A. It's our build and buy growth strategy. I just have to say that the funnel pipeline is more robust than I've seen in a number of years and nothing to obviously announce but we're very much engaged.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Waldman with Cleveland Research.\nJosh Waldman: Yes. Just a couple on my end and maybe Bob, starting with you first, a follow-up on the guide. Can you comment a bit more on how Q2 guide moved versus the framework and the initial outlook? I assume core outlook came down a bit but just wanted to confirm the moving pieces there. And then, does the core guide reflect any changes in Q3 or Q4? Or is it really just reflecting an update on H1?\nRobert McMahon: Yes, that's a good question. It's a little of both, Josh. So Q2 is relatively intact for what we had originally thought with the exception of that small movement of the China business, that's roughly a point of core growth from Q1 and Q2 switching. What I would say is Q1 also had a beat into it and what we're taking is some of that out of the second half of the year. And so the takeaway is Q2 is spot on from where we expected it to be, absent that kind of shifting the timing shift of China and then the Q2 or the rest of Q1 kind of the beat really helps us in the second half of the year.\nJosh Waldman: And then, Mike, can you talk about how visibility in the business as you've covered the last three months? Has there been any improvement in the ability of the funnel to predict near-term sales or still seeing an elongation of kind of opportunity and quoting, flipping to orders. Curious, total company and then also what you're seeing in pharma specifically.\nMike McMullen: Yes. No, I'll have Padraig jump in as well. I think the business remains the same. I don't think it's any better or any worse. And so I think it's the normal kind of cadence of business. And that's why, as Bob just mentioned, when we're talking about the second half, we bank some of the beat to put again the second half because we've yet to see the second half materialize in terms of the order book which is typical at this time of the year.\nPadraig McDonnell: I think that's right, Mike. And I think as far as the quality of orders remains -- that remain in our backlog, nothing has changed. We've not seen any increase in cancellations and ex China the funnel continues to grow and that's led by the aftermarket business. I will say as a continuing theme, the deal closure times remain at an elevated levels but it's definitely stable and deal win rates have been consistent.\nMike McMullen: Yes. I think there's been an important point made here, elevated but we're not seeing the elongation. So they're stable but they're longer than they have been in the past.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS.\nDan Leonard: My first question, just a bit more on China. Are you expecting sequential growth in Q2 in China similar to Q1?\nRobert McMahon: No, if you looked at the sequential number, it's going to be roughly the same as what we had in Q1.\nDan Leonard: And Mike, congrats on your retirement. I was wondering if you could elaborate on timing. I was surprised, others were surprised. I've gotten the question a number of times and we would just love to hear your thoughts.\nMike McMullen: Yes. Thanks for that. So while it's maybe a surprise to many on the call and it was a surprise when I shared the news across the company because the Agilent team just knows how much I love working for this company and work with them. And it really was a hard-wall, really difficult decision for me but not been contemplating this for a while. And I pulled the Board into the discussion sort of communicating with them because we really wanted to make sure that they had enough time to really run a thorough and thoughtful selection process in which they were able to do. And in my mind, they came out with the best possible choice in selecting Padraig. But yes but this is something that I've been contemplating for a while and then try to engage in the Board about my timing and then I really want to make sure they had enough time to really pick the right successor and that's what they did.\nDan Leonard: You always seem to be having a lot of fun. So congrats again it's been good.\nMike McMullen: Thank you. It's going to be hard to step away. But I have to say, the [indiscernible] family was just too strong. We have a 6-month old -- 18-month old grandson and he will soon have a brother and sister so there's a lot going on, on the family side. And there's only one way I could make more time. So again, it's been a real pleasure to work with all of you on the call.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Luke Sergott with Barclays.\nLuke Sergott: I just want to talk about the margins on the quarter and kind of the step down in DGG and LSAG and I assume, obviously, it's probably driven by the volume declines there on the instrument side. But how do you guys view the recovery in the margins between DGG and LSAG throughout the year to hit your guide?\nRobert McMahon: Luke, this is Bob. Just real quick. You're right. If I look at DGG, it actually was improvement year-over-year but it was down and it was really a result of that margin or the volume. I would say also there was an element of mix in LSAG and I would expect that to continue to improve. The cost actions that we took weren't fully actualized all and as expected in Q1. So we'll have the full impact of those as well in Q2 throughout. So I would expect an improvement over the course of the year as volumes grow up in both LSAG and DGG.\nLuke Sergott: And then, just a follow-up here from the 2Q guide. Can you just help frame what you guys are embedded there by the different segments?\nRobert McMahon: Yes, if I look at Q2 guide, we're still expecting, if I looked at the end market pharma down double-digits academia and government down low single digits really as a result of some of that timing shift, diagnostics and clinical down mid-singles and chemical and advanced materials, down high single digits and food about the same. Both of those are, as a result of some of the shift also in the China business from Q2 back into Q1 and then environmental and forensics kind of mid-single-digit decline.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc.\nPaul Knight: Mike, really super to see you love doing what you're doing and I knew you, I don't know, 15 years before you became CEO. So I guess, concluding question I would have, at least professionally, would be what do you see in terms of two things. Number one, why do you think the kind of market growth rate is for the markets that Agilent participates in? And then geographically, where do you see the surprise over the next 5 years? Like will Japan reinvigorate its growth? Will Europe see more in-sourcing? I would love to have your perspective on those things.\nMike McMullen: Thanks, Paul. Yes, we do go way back to don't we and it's been great to work with you over those years, going way back to the CAG days in my prior role, I think we think this is a 4% to 6% kind of growth market, mid-singles. So we think that the kind of market growth that we're not experienced in the industry right now is the anomalies and this will be back to that 4% to 6% kind of long-term growth rate. Obviously, certain segments within that overall macro number, that big TAM will be growing faster than that and that's always a challenge to make sure that you pick those segments so you can actually beat that number. I think there's going to be some geographic mix. I mean, we've evolved our view of long-term growth into China because we actually expect some of the supply chain moves and other things that have been going on that you'll see a growth, more growth in Europe which has been more of a slower grower for us geographically. But we've been -- continue to be surprised how well we do. Our team does in Europe. I think you're going to expect to see Japan rejuvenate it, particularly, I think you can make the case of the semi industry which is going to return to some strength in Japan. But that's the beauty of this business is just the diversified nature of both the end markets and geographies. So that would be my last -- I guess, my final projection of long-term growth for the market in this role. But thanks, Paul. I appreciate the comments and looking forward to staying in touch.\nOperator: I will now turn the call back over to Parmeet Ahuja for closing remarks.\nParmeet Ahuja: Thank you, Regina and thanks everyone for being on the call today. With that, we'd like to close the call. Have a good day, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert McMahon",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide some additional details on revenue in the quarter, as well as take you through the income statement and other key financial metrics. I'll then finish up with our second quarter guidance. Q1 revenue was $1.66 billion, a decline of 6.4% core. On a reported basis, currency added 0.9 percentage points, while M&A had a negative impact of 0.1%, resulting in a reported decline of 5.6%. And overall, orders were greater than revenue in Q1 as expected. As Mike mentioned, pharma, our largest end market declined 12%. Within pharma, biopharma declined low single digits but grew low single digits outside China, bolstered by strength in services and consumables. Small molecule was down high teens in the quarter with softness globally. The chemical and advanced materials market was down 4% off a very tough comparison of 14% growth last year. We saw broad resilience in advanced materials with a low single-digit increase year-on-year as well as growth sequentially. Given the extremely tough compare of high 20s growth last year, these are impressive results. As expected, the chemical side saw a decline. The academia and government market was up 2%. The growth in this market reflects the stability of academic funding and lab activity. Our business in the diagnostics and clinical market declined 5%, mid-single-digit growth in pathology was more than offset by continued headwinds in genomics, cell analysis and LC and LC/MS. The environmental and forensics market declined 1% after growing 12% in Q1 of last year. We continue to see new regulations around the world driving PFAS testing. Europe grew mid-single digits, while China and the Americas were down low single digits. Americas faced a difficult compare of low 30s growth last year. The food market declined 3% but was up low single digits, excluding China. On a geographic basis, as Mike mentioned, both China and Europe exceeded our expectations while the Americas were in line with our expectations. China was down 9% and showed a sequential increase over last quarter which was much better than expectations. China benefited from continued stabilization and a bigger-than-expected Lunar New Year impact as some customers pulled forward incremental demand from Q2. We estimate the pull-forward impact to be roughly $15 million or 5% of China's revenue in the quarter. Even adjusting for this impact, China outperformed. Europe was down 4% year-on-year after growing 10% last year and was up mid-single digits sequentially. This was driven by continued strong demand for our ACG services, offset by muted demand in pharma and expected softness in chemicals. In the Americas, revenue was down 8% due to declines in pharma and the softness in NASD and NGS chemistries. Moving down the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 56.0% down 50 basis points from a year ago as productivity and cost savings were offset by lower demand and mix. Our operating margin of 25.8% was down year-over-year as expected. Our ongoing cost savings initiatives are delivering as planned. Below the line, we benefited from greater-than-expected interest income in the quarter, driven by nice work from our treasury team, coupled with very strong cash flow. Our tax rate was 13.5% and we had 294 million diluted shares outstanding. Putting it all together, Q1 earnings per share were $1.29, down 6% from a year ago and ahead of our expectations. Now, let me turn to cash flow and the balance sheet. I continue to be very pleased with our cash flow generation. Operating cash flow was $485 million in the quarter, significantly above last year. In Q1, we invested $90 million in capital expenditures as we continue our planned NASD expansion. And during the quarter, we returned $69 million to shareholders through dividends. Although no shares were repurchased during the quarter, we expect to catch up on our anti-dilutive share repurchasing for the remainder of the year. In Q2, we expect a minimum of $180 million to be repurchased. All in all, we had a good start to the year. And as Mike mentioned, it reinforces our confidence in the full year guide we provided in November. Now, to our guidance for the second quarter. We expect Q2 revenue will be in the range of $1.56 billion to $1.59 billion. This represents a decline of 9.1% to 7.4% on a reported basis and a decline of 8.4% to 6.7% on a core basis against 9% growth last year. Currency and M&A combined are a headwind of 70 basis points. Our Q2 guidance also reflects the $15 million impact of the Q1 pull forward in China I mentioned earlier. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share expected to be between $1.17 and $1.20. Before turning back over to Mike, I just want to express my thanks to Mike and to congratulate Padraig. Mike, it has been a real pleasure to work with you. While there have been many ups and downs in the markets these past few years, one thing I knew I could always count on is your steady leadership and strong partnership. And Padraig, congratulations again. I'm really looking forward to working with you. And now, I'll turn things back over to Mike. Mike? Yes. Derik. And as you're talking about, we remain very optimistic about the future of NASD, our forecast for Train C and D remains intact in terms of building out the expansion. I would say that as we're talking about things, you mentioned one of the clinical trials. That's an important element of one of our customers. We are seeing some potential pushouts into FY '25. And as they are looking at revisiting the clinical trial programs and time lines and it's probably closer to flat this year based on that, although we're not giving up hope but that's built into kind of keeping our guide the way it is. But I think if you look at the number of commercial programs -- or excuse me, clinical programs that we have, we're very excited about the future. That's right. Yes, I was just going to say one of the things that we see is very strong performance in our services and our consumables business in the pharma sector which actually speaks to lab activity. And so while we've seen a depressed capital cycle here and we're optimistic about that turning around in the second half of the year. Matt, just one other quick thing on that. One of the great things that Angelica and team have been doing and you heard us talk about this a lot is about the increasing of the attach rate and that continues to grow at roughly 1 point again year-on-year this year. And that kind of locks in that resiliency of that stability in that business. And if you think about a 2/3 of that business growing double digits, it really helped power the business and when we see the inevitable turnaround of the instrument business, that will be a nice tailwind as well. Yes. That's a great question, Brandon. And you talked about a couple of them. We feel really good about where we started the year. It's still at the beginning of the year, though, so we're kind of banking some of that. What I would say is if you looked across the moving pieces, with the NASD being slightly lower, that would be offset by a little better results in the LSAG side of the business. And really, that chemical and advanced materials and academia are two areas that are probably slightly better than what we had forecasted. But overall, we're maintaining the guide and as we are looking here felt good about really at the start to the year. Yes. I'll take that. There are a lot of questions in that one question. But so true to form, Puneet and one of the things -- I'll start with the last one. I mean, we typically do have seasonality. There is that $15 million that gets pushed from one quarter to another; that's strictly timing in China because of the Lunar New Year. But Q2 is typically a lower revenue number. So we're building in that normal seasonality. In terms of book-to-bill in China, actually book-to-bill was greater than 1 in China; so continued stabilization. And in terms of book-to-bill for our instruments, it was below 1, are kind of expected. Now some of that was a result of the China pull forward where the orders came in and we were expecting that revenue to be shipped in Q2; so there's some element of timing there. But all in all, a positive start to the year. Yes, I'll take that, Puneet. If we look at across our business, the relative strength was actually in our biopharma. So a large molecule. And our business is skewed to the larger midsize and large cap companies. The standout has been the ACG business and our consumables on that. So it actually speaks to activity in the labs. We are starting to see -- I don't want to call it a trend but certainly a stabilization on the emerging biotech side of it. The instruments were still down but that is where we're starting to see the relative strength in the pharma business. And that speaks to kind of the long-term growth drivers, I think, in that market. And I would expect that to continue throughout the course of the year as our business gets stronger and the markets get stronger. And quite honestly, we have more favorable comps. That's right. Rachel, just one other thing to build on what Mike and Phil were just talking about. When we look at our LSAG business, it was down 11% which was better than what we expected. The piece that's really been driving that down is the pharma market which is what we've been expecting. If we looked at the rest of the markets, they were much better than the down 11% with the exception of the diagnostics and clinical which is a small number. Yes. And Bill, just a final -- put a finer point on that, January came in as we expected. Yes. We were pleased with the results. It was between 1% and 2%. So but in line with kind of the seasonality and the mix that we saw, we would expect to see in Q1. So right now, it's on track. As we've talked about, our consumables business and ACG business have the greatest price realization followed by generally speaking, actually, we had a very good result in diagnostics and genomics in the quarter. And then we did see some mix but not anything out of the ordinary instrumentation side. So all in, we're on track for what we expected for the full year. Yes. Thanks, Patrick. Great question. And what I would say is a couple of things. We are on track to have more interest income than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year that $20 million and some of that in the first quarter as well and that's really a result of actually having better-than-expected cash flow in the first quarter and great work by the treasury team. I would say that the savings -- we're on track for the savings targets for the full year. And as I think about the year, it's still very early in the year and this provides us what I would say is more confidence in the guide. Yes, no change to what we said back in November. Q1 is a proof point for what we said. Yes, I would say we typically don't give all that information but it was down -- we were down 11%. It was down, puts 20%, in the quarter but that was better than expected, offset by 6% growth in our consumables business. If we look at the LSAG thinking for Q2, it's down low teens. So -- and a lot of that has to do with some of the timing associated with that $15 million shift. That's almost all capital equipment from Q1 -- from Q2 back into Q1. So if you look at it, it is in line with where we expect it to be. Correct, correct. Yes, yes. I think we're cautiously optimistic there. I'd say it's still within a range that we had before, so I don't want to call an inflection. But if you looked at the markets we were down that 9% was roughly down 20%-ish [ph] in pharma. So that continues to be the area of really around the globe but China is no different. The great thing is many of the other markets performed much better. So even when you think about like academia and government, that grew, so did our chem and advanced material business now grew very low single digits. And then our forensics in environmental was down low single digits. So you're actually starting to see the continued stabilization and then you'll get into very much easier compares in the back half of the year in China because that down 22% was down compared to up 12% last year. We had another strong compare in Q2 and then we actually started seeing the pretty significant declines year-on-year. And so there's reasons to be optimistic about that continued stabilization that Mike talked about but we're not ready yet to call an inflection. But when it happens, we'll take it. So small molecule on a global basis was down roughly 18%. And it was ex China, it was down 20% and down roughly 14% for China. So pretty consistent across the globe. I would say, in China, the big area in China that has been impacted is on the small molecule side, where we'll start to see better comps going forward after Q2. Our consumables business was pretty consistent across the globe in terms of growth. That's right. Thanks, Mike. And as you said, our NGS QC portfolio from an instrument and consumable side actually grew mid-single digits in the quarter which was very nice. The genomics chemistry side that we referenced in the prepared remarks was down. We faced some very difficult comps. We had a couple of companies that reorganized and exited some businesses. They had some lifetime buys at the end of Q1. I would expect that the performance of that to improve starting in the second half of the year. Doug, this is Bob. I'll take that last one. We'll tell you when we get to Q4 and what I would say but your math is -- in all seriousness, your math is spot on as usual. I think one of the things that we look at is, we look at it a couple of different ways. I think the way to look at it is that first half, second half kind of looking at seasonality, that's probably more instructive given kind of the changes in the growth rates. And when you look at it, as you noticed -- as you mentioned, it is in line with our historical seasonality. And when you look at the growth rates, you're right, we are expecting growth in the back half of the year. A lot of that is, in fact, the easier the compares. And when we actually look at -- what I would ask you to take a look at also is a 2-year stack basis relative to implied Q1 and first half and second half. And what you would see there is a much more smooth number that we also looked at as well. So as usual, you're spot on there. Yes, that's a good question. It's a little of both, Josh. So Q2 is relatively intact for what we had originally thought with the exception of that small movement of the China business, that's roughly a point of core growth from Q1 and Q2 switching. What I would say is Q1 also had a beat into it and what we're taking is some of that out of the second half of the year. And so the takeaway is Q2 is spot on from where we expected it to be, absent that kind of shifting the timing shift of China and then the Q2 or the rest of Q1 kind of the beat really helps us in the second half of the year. No, if you looked at the sequential number, it's going to be roughly the same as what we had in Q1. Luke, this is Bob. Just real quick. You're right. If I look at DGG, it actually was improvement year-over-year but it was down and it was really a result of that margin or the volume. I would say also there was an element of mix in LSAG and I would expect that to continue to improve. The cost actions that we took weren't fully actualized all and as expected in Q1. So we'll have the full impact of those as well in Q2 throughout. So I would expect an improvement over the course of the year as volumes grow up in both LSAG and DGG. Yes, if I look at Q2 guide, we're still expecting, if I looked at the end market pharma down double-digits academia and government down low single digits really as a result of some of that timing shift, diagnostics and clinical down mid-singles and chemical and advanced materials, down high single digits and food about the same. Both of those are, as a result of some of the shift also in the China business from Q2 back into Q1 and then environmental and forensics kind of mid-single-digit decline."

And a part of that demand has really been driven by the lab-wide enterprise services offerings, where we're able to help customers as they're navigating their own economic situation really helping them optimize their entire lab operation. And our portfolio offerings in this stage have allowed us to really facilitate that improvement in lab operations, lab efficiency and that's particularly important to those enterprise customers."

You have made a significant impact on Agilent, our customers and our team. I'd also like to welcome Angelica Riemann to this call. After leading our services division for the last 2.5 years, I can tell you she has the experience and the skill set to continue evolving ACG to align with the growing opportunities that the business has demonstrated in supporting the broad installed base and our enterprise customers. Expect to see continued great things ahead from Angelica and ACG. I've had the pleasure of meeting some of you on this call and I look forward to meeting and working with you all in the future. Agilent has a compelling story to tell and I'm excited by the possibilities that lie in front of us as we help our customers bring great signs to life. Yes. Thanks, Mike. And I think customers continue to be cautious globally. I think as we're stable -- what we're seeing a stability but no material improvement versus what we saw in the last half of last year. And in terms of the capital budget cycle in '24, this is the time we see it. It's pretty early in that cycle. But we've heard move in both directions, positive and negative but fewer customers expecting negative budgets. So we're watching and seeing how that goes. Yes. And I think if, Matt, as you just mentioned, we aren't assuming any inflection in our guide. That's been consistent. Actually, Q1 ended up being a little better than we anticipated. We kind of putting that money in the bank, so to speak. And if you look at it, we'll have now quarters of numbers that are relatively stable which is a very positive sign. And I think when we look at our funnel, it's also stable as well as the order funnel -- order forecast is what Mike just talked about as well. Yes. That's right, Mike. I think it's really a tale of two submarkets. We saw broad resilience in the advanced materials with sequential growth. And given the extremely tough compare and high 20s we had last year, it was truly a very impressive result from the teams. The chemical and energy side was -- we saw a decline but on a very tough compare of 10% but we did see a sequential improvement versus Q4 '23. Overall, I think our portfolio is extremely strong in this area. We have ability to cross and upsell across that. And of course, our strong services offerings have that value proposition. Yes. No, I think that's right, Mike. I think on the ACG side, we see a number of service -- our service contract business comes in strong under the ACG side but on the capital side, we're not seeing much. Yes. And I think what we see is as also consumables and services continue to outperform expectations in China, so that's kind of we expect that to continue. I think that's right, Mike. And I think as far as the quality of orders remains -- that remain in our backlog, nothing has changed. We've not seen any increase in cancellations and ex China the funnel continues to grow and that's led by the aftermarket business. I will say as a continuing theme, the deal closure times remain at an elevated levels but it's definitely stable and deal win rates have been consistent."

            "content": "Thanks, Parmeet and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. Before I review our first quarter results, I want to first acknowledge our news last week that I will be retiring at the end of the fiscal year and that Padraig McDonnell is Agilent's new Chief Operating Officer and will become CEO on May 1. It was a difficult decision to retire after almost 40 great years with this special company and in the role that I love, I will miss working with the One Agilent team. However, I must say it's a great feeling and quite gratifying to be handing over the CEO reins to a tremendously capable successor in Padraig. With Agilent operating from a position of strength and with a very promising long-term outlook. I have known Padraig for more than 20 years. I've worked closely with him during that time. He has always been completely committed to our customers and Agilent's success. He is a product of our culture, knows our company, team and markets and those have developed compelling business strategies, build winning teams and deliver exceptional results. Padraig has a strong track record result at every position he has held during his 26-year career at Agilent. I know he has the knowledge, leadership skills and customer focus that will be key to Agilent's success moving forward. I look forward to all of you seeing first-hand what a capable result driven leader we have in Padraig. Padraig would you like to say a few words? Thanks, Padraig. For today's call, I will take lead, covering the overview of our financial results, while next quarter, Padraig will take on these duties as the new CEO. Now, on to the Q1 results. We are pleased with the start of the year. The Agilent team continues its strong execution in a challenging market environment. The first quarter provided further evidence of our team's capabilities with revenue coming in better than expected at $1.66 billion. This represents a decline of 6.4% against a tough compare of 10% growth in Q1 of last year. The better-than-expected top line results and disciplined cost management drove higher-than-expected earnings per share of $1.29 down 6% from Q1 last year. Given the solid Q1 results and our continued view is slow but steady recovery throughout the year, we are maintaining our full year outlook that we shared with you in November. Key to our Q1 performance was the ongoing sequential stabilization we experienced in China and secular growth drivers in applied markets globally. From an end market perspective, our total pharma business is down 12% which was in line with our expectations. This falls 11% increase in the first quarter last year. While declining overall against a very strong Q1 of last year, our applied end markets were more resilient than expected and show sequential growth from the fourth quarter. In these markets, PFAS Solutions and Advanced Materials, including batteries and semiconductors were high bits for us. Geographically, both China and Europe finished Q1 better than expected, while revenue for the Americas was in line with expectations. Looking at performance by business unit, the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group delivered revenues of $846 million and down 11%. This is against a difficult compare of 10% growth last year. While still too early to call an overall market recovery, results were better than expected. Our diversified portfolio and broad end market coverage helped drive the performance. We continue to experience a conservative environment for capital spending. But are better than expected, Q1 results were driven by consumables which grew mid-single digits, China and a better-than-expected performance in applied markets. During the quarter, we also completed the expansion of our Shanghai manufacturing facility as we continue to take steps to ensure our long-term leadership in China. We also made our first customer shipments for Agilent's newly released LC/MS offerings. Our latest highest sensitivity triple quad, the 6495D enables expanded and enhanced workflows, including for PFAS. This, in addition to Revident, the first of a new generation of LC/Q-TOF systems that combine a new architecture with enhanced instrument intelligence for maximize operation time and productivity. The Agilent CrossLab Group posted revenue of $405 million. This is up 5% with growth across all regions except China. Our contracts business led the way with double-digit growth overall, led by strength in enterprise service contracts. This performance highlights the continued strength and resiliency of our business. Connect rates for both services and consumables continue to improve. This is a result of our focused strategy to deliver end-to-end customer value while also building a larger recurring revenue business. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group delivered revenue of $407 million, down 6% core. Our pathology-related businesses and our NGS QC portfolio grew mid-single digits which was more than offset by declines in NGS chemistries and NASD. NASD declined low double digits as expected. This is because a very tough compare of 22% growth driven by significant volume last year from a single commercial program. We continue to be encouraged with our long-term prospects due to the increasing number of programs across a range of indications many of them target large patient populations. The DGG team continues to innovate and deliver differentiated solutions for our customers. In the quarter, we induced a new ProteoAnalyzer system. The new platform simplifies and improves the efficiency of analyzing complex protein mixtures. And processes that are central to analytical workflows across the pharma, biotech, food analysis and academia sectors. From an overall Agilent perspective, we recently achieved World Economic Forum recognition for operations of Waldbronn, Germany. This site was named a Global Lighthouse for implementing innovation that boost productivity, output and quality. This marks the second Global Lighthouse award for us after seeing the recognition for our Singapore facility two years ago. Agilent is the only life science tools company to be recognized as a Global Lighthouse. Agilent recently achieved a top 5 ranking in the Barron's list of 100 most sustainable companies. In addition, we are included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index globally and in North America for the ninth year in a row. Looking ahead, we expect the current market environment to persist through the first half, we expect a slow and steady improvement in the second half of the year. We will continue taking actions that will make us stronger and position us well for the future. We will maintain our approach to prioritize investing for growth with a focus on execution and driving productivity. Our better-than-expected Q1 results and my confidence the Agilent team reinforced our view for the full year. Bob will now provide the details on our results as well as our outlook for Q2. After Bob's comments, I will rejoin for some closing remarks. And now, Bob, over to you. Thanks, Bob. Today marks my 37th and final earnings call with all of you. Time does truly fly by. I want to first thank you for your support and engagement over the years. I have to say it has been a tremendous honor serving as Agilent's CEO and represent the achievements of the One Agilent team to all of you and the broader investor community. In 2015, we launched the then new Agilent with a goal to transform Agilent into a leading life science and diagnostics company. We had ambitious goals to drive long-term shareholder value creation with significantly stepped up financial results delivered by an unmatched One Agilent team working together in a truly differentiated and compelling company culture. I couldn't be proud of the Agilent team and what we've accomplished together over the last 9 years. While current market conditions remain challenging, the long-term promise of growth remains with end markets power buying investments to improve the human condition. On the Agilent front, we've never been in a stronger position to continue to capitalize on opportunities to serve our customers within the market and deliver differentiated financial results. It's been a pleasure to work with all of you over the years. I will miss it. While at the same time, I know that you will enjoy working with Padraig in the years ahead. Like me, I know you'll be impressed with Padraig's knowledge of our industry and our business. As I noted earlier, he knows how to develop compelling business strategies, build winning teams and deliver exceptional results. His track record of success during his Agilent leadership journey speaks for itself and have no doubt, it will continue in his new role. While this is my last earnings call with you, I'm certain that the best is yet to come for Agilent. Thank you. And now over to you, Parmeet for the Q&A. I'll tag team with Bob on this. So as you saw in our prepared remarks, Q1 came in as expected for the NASD business. And we are in a situation where we've had, I think, the broadest number of clinical programs and such. So we're very active. The volume is less commercial this year as we pointed out in the script as well versus clinical. And Bob, I know we've been talking a lot with the team about the outlook for the year, particularly with some of our customers who are resequencing some of the clinical programs into '25. And Bob, I think it's also fair to say that this is not a byproduct of overcapacity in the industry or a significant change in in-sourcing. It's really how some of our customers are reacting to really the IRAC. Yes. Great question, Derik. Obviously, top of mind, within Agilent, as we mentioned, Q1 came in where we thought it would. But what's the outlook? And Padraig, I know you've just spending a lot of time with your team and customers talking about this exact question. Yes. I think what you shared with me earlier, Padraig, was the tone was more negative at this time last year. It's still not super positive yet and still a lot of caution but we're not seeing anything to cause us to change our outlook for the year. I think Bob -- thank you very much. I think, Bob, you had one. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Matt. And as we had a really, I think, a nice print to start off the year. A big part of that was the performance in China. Yes, we had a bit of a pull-in from Q2 from Lunar New Year but the business overall was better than expected. And to answer your question, we now have several quarters real orders, real revenue and the sequential growth, the numbers are real. So we're not seeing anything on the macro world that would also dramatically change what has continued to be a very challenging economic market in China. So what gives us confidence is the fact that we've had a number of quarters now, our predictability in the business. The numbers are coming in slightly better than we had anticipated. But again, I think it's more just the fact that there's ongoing run rate of business that gives us confidence on the outlook. And Bob, I know that you want to jump in on this one Padraig? Matt, thanks for your support of the ACG business over the years. And I want to use this opportunity to introduce our new ACG Group President. But first, I'd like to maybe have a two-part response probably and Bob, I think it's roughly about 65% just to make sure. So roughly about 65% of our total services business is in the contracts arena. And Angelica, maybe you could share your thoughts on really what's been driving the growth we're seeing in that contract business. And in times of tough economic times, the market times, the productivity help and driving productivity in the labs as a well-received offering we have. So, absolutely, Bob. Yes. So I'll do a tag team on this with Padraig. So as you may recall, we've talked earlier this year about these secular growth drivers in the applied markets. And we saw that pretty much across the globe. And I think what we're seeing again is the investments being made in advanced materials relative to the semiconductor supply chain and also the fab is driving productivity. We're seeing continued investment relative to battery, battery development, QA/QC. And I think we continue to see some real nice growth in the PFAS side of our environmental business. Started in the U.S., I think all those applied market secular drivers that we've been pointing to for, for some time, delivered in Q1. And I think our outlook remains the same that we're expecting there'll be a source of positivity for us in the overall CAM [ph] market space, albeit the chemical market is expected to remain subdued. Bob, if I cover headline on that, too, I'd just say that Q2 seasonality is as normal and the Q1 book-to-bill results are as our normal pattern. So again, we've been talking a lot about normalization of business flow. And I think we're seeing it in terms of the seasonal patterns and book-to-revenue situations. Bob, I think I recall correctly, outside of China, our biopharma business actually grew in the quarter. I don't think there's any new trends here. I think without going into the details of our product line, the small molecule side has really been in an area where we've talked about the year-on-year challenges there from the LC side. But Phil, I don't know if you want to jump in with any thoughts here but I don't think there's any real outstanding new trends here with perhaps the better-than-expected trends we saw in applied markets, particularly on advanced materials but maybe you have something else you want to add? Right. And to your question, Rachel, that dynamic in the pharma really speaks to pressure on the LC business. Well, I've been in this business for a while and it's always slow in January. And that's why we have the seasonality we talked about relative to Q2. So I don't think we're seeing any significantly different trends that we've seen historically. Padraig, I know that you're closer than I am but [indiscernible]. Both Padraig and I are in the conference and we're shaking our head, no. We've not heard anything about any potential stimulus. And what I can tell you is if it does happen, it's upside to our outlook. Bob, do you want to take that one? I know the team did a calculation on that because LSAG was down 11% but that includes our consumables business which was up. And then, we go into more favorable compares in Q3 and Q4. I think we've have raised it up a bit. It's still down... And Padraig, I know you want to jump in this as well. Yes, I think the story is a great. I think the story really was in pharma, Q1, the instrument and the CapEx side of things. But we're pleased with the start there. So I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that on the -- or we've seen the consumables, I think we're really pleased to see that because it really speaks to the lab activity being robust. So anything else you want to jump in on with? Thanks, Phil. I'm really glad you close with the comments about connect rates. We talked about that relative to our services business, we're also seeing a very strong positive trend on consumables as well which bodes well to our future in terms of recurring revenue business growth. I think I'll invite Bob in on this one but I think it's been sort of a tale of two cities. When we talk about our genomics business, there's really two pieces to it. The half of it's in QA/QC activities for NGS workflows and we're seeing really solid growth in the consumables on that side of things as well as you're starting to see signs of life on the CapEx, not the current because the call churn there yet but that's in a reasonably good shape. I think we've seen really in our U.S.-based genomics business, some really market challenges have been hitting us. And Bob, maybe you can elaborate on that? Yes, Jack, thanks for noticing that. That was a real bright spot for us. We actually grew, I think, 2% in the quarter. And this is -- we've been working on this thing for some time to really build out our portfolio and really change our market position in academia research and I think it's starting to show up in the numbers. I think stabilization really is what we're seeing which is the funding is there. And NIH is a relatively really small part of Agilent's business, so really is immaterial. But we're seeing universities have increasingly been funded through private sector. So the money is there. And even so, we saw money in China as well. So it was really a nice global story for us and we're fairly optimistic that, that kind of stabilization can be there for us for the rest of the year. Surely, absolutely. Go ahead, Doug. And Bob, I think that's why we really emphasized in the script, the word stabilization because as things, as we have kind of a stabilization, we're going to get a lift in the growth rate just by the comps as they go. Yes. I think we remain very interested in deploying capital in a balanced way which is inclusive of investing for in the business. And that speaks directly to we are interested in M&A. It's our build and buy growth strategy. I just have to say that the funnel pipeline is more robust than I've seen in a number of years and nothing to obviously announce but we're very much engaged. Yes. No, I'll have Padraig jump in as well. I think the business remains the same. I don't think it's any better or any worse. And so I think it's the normal kind of cadence of business. And that's why, as Bob just mentioned, when we're talking about the second half, we bank some of the beat to put again the second half because we've yet to see the second half materialize in terms of the order book which is typical at this time of the year. Yes. I think there's been an important point made here, elevated but we're not seeing the elongation. So they're stable but they're longer than they have been in the past. Yes. Thanks for that. So while it's maybe a surprise to many on the call and it was a surprise when I shared the news across the company because the Agilent team just knows how much I love working for this company and work with them. And it really was a hard-wall, really difficult decision for me but not been contemplating this for a while. And I pulled the Board into the discussion sort of communicating with them because we really wanted to make sure that they had enough time to really run a thorough and thoughtful selection process in which they were able to do. And in my mind, they came out with the best possible choice in selecting Padraig. But yes but this is something that I've been contemplating for a while and then try to engage in the Board about my timing and then I really want to make sure they had enough time to really pick the right successor and that's what they did. Thank you. It's going to be hard to step away. But I have to say, the [indiscernible] family was just too strong. We have a 6-month old -- 18-month old grandson and he will soon have a brother and sister so there's a lot going on, on the family side. And there's only one way I could make more time. So again, it's been a real pleasure to work with all of you on the call. Thanks, Paul. Yes, we do go way back to don't we and it's been great to work with you over those years, going way back to the CAG days in my prior role, I think we think this is a 4% to 6% kind of growth market, mid-singles. So we think that the kind of market growth that we're not experienced in the industry right now is the anomalies and this will be back to that 4% to 6% kind of long-term growth rate. Obviously, certain segments within that overall macro number, that big TAM will be growing faster than that and that's always a challenge to make sure that you pick those segments so you can actually beat that number. I think there's going to be some geographic mix. I mean, we've evolved our view of long-term growth into China because we actually expect some of the supply chain moves and other things that have been going on that you'll see a growth, more growth in Europe which has been more of a slower grower for us geographically. But we've been -- continue to be surprised how well we do. Our team does in Europe. I think you're going to expect to see Japan rejuvenate it, particularly, I think you can make the case of the semi industry which is going to return to some strength in Japan. But that's the beauty of this business is just the diversified nature of both the end markets and geographies. So that would be my last -- I guess, my final projection of long-term growth for the market in this role. But thanks, Paul. I appreciate the comments and looking forward to staying in touch."

We're seeing some bright spots around some of the secular areas in the applied markets, in the instrumentation which is driving the business forward but just support your comments there. Yes. Probably just one item there, Mike. I think we are seeing really good traction around our workflow development. So end-to-end solutions which obviously is also drives our services business as well. But around the consumables, the -- in most of our end markets, we've been pretty heavily focused on developing workflows and making our customers' lives easier and more integrated in our labs and that's showing some really good traction and that's reflected in solid connected attach rates in the consumable space."
