Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Heads of our Operating Divisions. Before we get started, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the tumultuous year that was 2020. It was a year that tested everything from our physical health to our mental state of mind to how we see one another is impacted our colleagues, our families, our communities around the world. They brought personal hardship and loss, stresses and challenges that none of us would have predicted a year ago. I believe we've learned a lot about ourselves and our society over the past year and while 2020 is behind us many issues and difficulties remain, but let's not forget 2020 also showed us that the world can work together towards a common goal to develop vaccines in order to solve a global problem. And for that, I'm both thankful and I remain optimistic about our future. Now onto the discussion of the quarter and year. We delivered an excellent fourth quarter in the midst of the pandemic. We grew organically. We picked up momentum and grew through acquisitions. We improved our productivity and raised our quality. We continued to invest in our bedrock culture. I'm extremely proud of how the team performed during the quarter and the full year. In our Brokerage segment, fourth quarter reported revenue growth was a positive 3.6%. Most of that or 3.1% was organic revenue growth. We executed on our cost containment playbook and further utilized our centers of excellence saving about $60 million in the quarter, helping drive our net earnings margin higher by 281 basis points and expanding our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 579 basis points and net earnings were up 33% and adjusted EBITDAC was up 30%, another fantastic quarter for the Brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and give you some sound bites about each of our brokerage units, starting with our PC operations. In U.S. retail, organic growth was strong at about 4.5%. New business and client retention was similar to last year's fourth quarter and mid-term policy modifications, including full policy cancellations, were slightly better than prior year levels. In our U.S. wholesale operations, risk placement services organic was about 5%, open brokerage organic was more than 20% due to strong renewals fueled by double digit rate increases. Our MGA programs binding businesses were up about 2%, retention was better sequentially, but as expected new business wins are still lagging given the economy. Moving to the UK, around 4.5% organic for the quarter in both our retail and specialty operations, new and lost business was consistent with prior year and special mention to our aviation team. They performed well in their largest quarter of the year helping clients navigate exposures that were down significantly, call it 30% to 40%, and rate increases that pushed premiums close to pre-COVID levels. Australia and New Zealand combined posted organic of about 1%. The spread between new and lost business was similar to last year, but we're not getting as much lift from rate and exposure as we had in previous years. And finally, our Canadian retail operations posted organic of 13%, another terrific new business quarter combined with a nice tick-up in client retention and strong rate environment. So, overall, our global PC operations posted 4.5% organic, which is a bit better than the 4% we discussed at our December Investor Day. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business, fourth quarter organic was around minus 2%, which is at the favorable end of what we thought during our December IR Day. Similar to the previous couple of quarters fees from consulting arrangements and special project work were down. However, revenue from our traditional health and welfare business continues to hold up, with slightly positive fourth quarter organic, which is an encouraging sign. So, when I bring PC and benefits together, total brokerage segment, organic of 3.1%, a really strong quarter in this environment. And even better when you consider the tough compare against the fourth quarter of 2019 of over 6%. Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market, starting the rate environment. Global PC rates continued to march higher during the fourth quarter and overall. Rate was up around 8% across our footprint. Rates in Canada led the way up more than 12%. The U.S. was up more than 8% with wholesale stronger than retail, including rate increases of 15% within our wholesale open brokerage operations, followed by the UK, including London Specialty at about 5% and Australia and New Zealand combined in the low single digits.  By line of business property and professional liability are up 12%, other casually lines are up mid-to-high single digits and worker's comp was flat to modestly positive. Not only are PC rates, continuing to rise terms and conditions are tightening and capacity is becoming increasingly constrained for some coverages. Nearly every area and line of business is firm or firming. And there are even a few lines that are very hard, like umbrella, cyber and public company D&O. So needless to say, it is a difficult PC environment. This is where our teams excel, helping businesses, many of which are still struggling, navigate the market through creative program design, shopping coverages, and altering programs with increasing deductibles or reduced limits to help their risk management programs fit their budgets. Looking forward, I see similar PC market conditions continuing in 2021. And while economic growth is coming, the pace of the recovery remains uncertain. So we remain laser-focused on what we can control, delivering the very best insurance and risk management advice. Now successfully doing this virtually more than ever before, constantly improving our high-quality customer service, engaging with new prospects and growing our new business pipeline. Thus far in January, full policy cancellations and other midterm policy adjustments are trending similar to January 2020. Although it's still early, we're seeing year-over-year, renewal premium increases at levels comparable to fourth quarter 2020. On the benefit side, the annual enrollment season is behind us. And for many of our clients we saw covered lives stabilize from last year's declines, while retention in new business were similar to pre-COVID levels. In addition, a few of our benefits consulting practices are seeing increased activity and engagements early on in the year. So, while there's a lot of year left, these early January indications give me further conviction that full year 2021 Brokerage segment organic will be even better than 3.2% we delivered in 2020. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions, following an active December, we finished the fourth quarter with 10 completed brokerage mergers representing about a $100 million of estimated annualized revenues. And we've announced a handful more so far in January, representing an additional $85 million of estimated annualized revenues. This includes The Bollington merger in the UK, which we think will close in early February after receiving regulatory approval this week. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us. And I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our M&A pipeline, we have 30 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $300 million of annualized revenues. We believe we are the platform of choice for successful entrepreneurs looking to take their business to the next level, by leveraging our niche expertise, our tools and data, in addition to being a great place for their employees to advance their careers. We expect to have a very active 2021, particularly in the U.S. due to concerns related to possible tax changes. So, to wrap up the Brokerage segment for the full year, we delivered 5.4% growth in revenue, 3.2%, all-in organic growth. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 418 basis points, fueled by cost savings of about $180 million. And we completed 27 mergers representing about $250 million of estimated annualized revenue, a fantastic year for the brokerage team. Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter, organic edged back into positive territory, nicely surpassing our December expectations of being down as much as 2%, with some positive lift due to increasing COVID-related workers' compensation claims and saw strong retention in new business. So we ended 2020 with full year organic of minus 2.7%. And this environment to close a year in which core claim counts were down double-digits for more than 10 months of the year. And after posting 10% organic decline in the second quarter alone is a just terrific recovery story. Going back to April in the beginning of the pandemic, we set our sites on delivering full year 2020 adjusted EBITDAC, similar to 2019, even with full year revenues forecasted to be down $38 million or more. And boy, that the team deliver, the team proactively manage this workforce carefully rebalanced claim loads across adjusters and implemented expense controls, ultimately driving 2020 adjusted EBITDAC of nearly $150 million, $4 million better than 2019. Being able to grow full year EBITDAC despite organic revenues that were backwards. It's just fantastic work by the risk management team. As we look forward, January claim counts are trending very similar to the fourth quarter with many clients operating still at partial capacity with new business sold in 2020, incepting over the next few quarters and still room for substantial job recovery. We believe full year 2021 organic will be closer to pre-COVID levels in the mid single-digit range. Let me wrap up with some comments regarding our unique and resilient Gallagher culture. Culture guides our organization, our people in both good times and even more so in demanding times. And I believe culture is the source of our perseverance, our determination, and our constant push for excellence. I'm extremely proud of our collective successes during 2020, but more importantly, how we came together to work as a team, even while physically apart, our culture has never been better and I believe we're ending 2021 even stronger. Okay, I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDoug Howell: Thanks Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll echo Pat's comments on great quarter and an excellent year. I too would like to extend my appreciation to the team. Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cost savings, provide some, a few observations from our CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. Then I'll do a vignette on our clean energy investments and finish with some thoughts on M&A, cash and liquidity. All right, let's turn to the earnings release, Page 6 to the brokerage EBITDAC table. You'll see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by about $85 million over last year's fourth quarter, resulting in about 580 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $60 million of cost savings relative to fourth quarter 2019 adjusted for merger. So underlying margin expansion was about 115 basis points on 3.1% all-in organic, which on its own is impressive. When you move to Page 8, in Risk Management segment, we grew EBITDAC a bit more than $4 million on slightly positive organic, resulting in about 190 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $5 million of cost savings relative to Q4 2019, which was moderated just a little by new client ramp-up costs. So underlying margins were up just a bit, that too is actually giving the flattish organic this quarter. Categories of fourth quarter savings for the combined brokerage and risk management segment were consistent with second and third quarter. Reduced travel, entertainment and advertising about $25 million, reduced consulting and professional fees $14 million, reduced outside labor and other workforce savings $16 million, office supplies, consumables, and occupancy costs about $10 million. So that total is around $65 million, which is consistent with what we said at our December IR Day. Now looking forward the pace of recovery isn't clear, we came into the year with another virus surge. Now maybe some positive cases coming down. Some areas are imposing more lockdowns yet others are loosening up. There's been some successes but mostly delays in a vaccine rollout. And now it's looking like more and more that's the stimulus might be caught in gridlock here in the U.S. Regardless of whether you're looking at half full or half empty glass, very few outlooks are expecting the business environment to be much different by the end of the first quarter. So for us, when it comes to first quarter 2021, we're inorganic in the 3% to 4% range, and we're seeing expense saving similar to fourth quarter 2020, call it another $600 million \u2013 excuse me, $60 million. If that happens, and we could again show margin expansion over about 500 basis points. Then looking towards second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, it gets a little more tricky when you do your models, because the slope of the recovery is still uncertain and we're getting through \u2013 we're already realizing substantial COVID induced expense savings beginning early in April of 2020. But if the recovery steps up in those quarters and we get back to organic of, say, high 4% or 5%, it does give us a path towards holding full year margins, especially if travel and entertainment remains limited. Now, all of this needs to be taken into context. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, we were expanding margins 50 to 75 basis points a year on organic in that 4% to 5% range. Then the COVID hits, we execute on our cost containment playbook, and still managed to grow organic 3% that pops margins over 400 basis points in the face of this global pandemic. So now what I'm saying is that we have a fighting chance to hold or even improve full year margins here in 2021 on the prospect of getting closer to pre-pandemic organic growth later in the year. To me, that's still about a bullish story as you could write. Now, if we move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website, on Page 2, the blue fourth quarter column, you'll see most of the items are consistent with what we provided during our December IR Day, and that's in the gray column. FX came in a $0.01 better and severance and integration costs also a $0.01 better when you compare that to the prior quarters. Also on Page 2 in the reddish column, we're now providing our quarterly look at 2021, a few comments. First, foreign exchange. With the U.S. dollar weakening and if it stays that way throughout the year, 2021 revenue could see $100 million tailwind in brokerage and $14 million in risk management. Wouldn't be much EPS impact within risk management, but could translate late into a $0.05 or so for our brokerage segment, and that would even be better on reported EBITDA. Second, amortization expense. We're currently forecasting a little over $100 million a quarter in brokerage, which includes all announced mergers to-date. You can see the role in revenues associated with all announced mergers to-date on Page 5. And then also don't forget to adjust your amortization expense in the second and later quarters to reflect any future M&A you might be including in your model. Third, when you look at M&A multiples shown on Page 2 on the last line of the table, like that said, we had an active December closing ten. Three of which were on the larger end of our typical tuck-in size. That pushed the multiple up a tuner so this year, but still creating a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple. More importantly, it brings some really terrific merger partners to the team letting us grow better together over the long-haul. When you move to Page 3 of the CFO commentary in the corporate table, when you compare our December IR Day estimates in the gray column with our fourth quarter results in the blue column, you posted favorable interest expense due to strong cash flows, we had better clean energy earnings, in line M&A expense and a slightly more favorable corporate line. Also on Page 3, we're now providing a first look at 2021 ranges for the corporate segment, and that's in the reddish column. Nothing surprising and there's no change on our outlook for clean energy, still in that $60 million to $75 million of annual after tax earnings we've provided during our IR Day. So this brings me to my vignette on clean energy. You read on Page 4, Note 5 of the CFO commentary document that these investments are winding down at the end of 2021, unless there's an extension. That means in 2022, we will have zero GAAP earnings. But remember, that would be more than replaced with substantial cash flow benefits. In other words, 2021 and prior years were the credit generation years when we report the GAAP benefit or P&L. But 2022 starts the cash harvest years, where we will get considerably larger cash benefits in our operating cash flows. Here's the shortcut way to think about how to compete those cash benefits. First, if you go to Page 14 of the earnings release about the seventh line down in our balance sheet, you\u2019ll read that we have a deferred tax asset of over $1 billion, mostly consisting of clean energy credit carry forwards. With one more year of credit generation, that asset should grow by another $100 million. So call it $1.1 billion of credit carry over is by the end of 2021. Then assuming 2022, we will begin using more credits than we\u2019ve been using thus far. How \u2013 third, then how fast we\u2019ll be using those credits will depend on how fast we grow our U.S. taxable income. But for this illustration, and if you assume a seven-year period, it might mean we\u2019d be harvesting about $125 million to $150 million in 2022 with that ramping up to say about $175 million to $200 million in 2028. It\u2019s a little odd that GAAP earnings go to zero and then the cash benefits become dramatically better, but that\u2019s just how it works. This is and has been a really important part of our story over the last decade. So I think it was worth some extra time today. All right, let me go on to some comments on cash in M&A. At December 31, available cash on hand was nearly $700 million. We have a significant untapped capacity in our \u2013 on our revolving credit facility. And we have another year ahead of us have really strong cash flows. That might mean that we would have perhaps two point \u2013 up to $2.5 billion of M&A capacity here in 2021. That\u2019s a terrific position as we come into our year that we see as perhaps the most active year ever in the brokerage M&A space. Okay. That\u2019s wraps up 2020 and we\u2019re positioned really well for 2021. Organic looks better, bolt-on M&A, it looks better. We have a decent chance of keeping a large chunk of our cost savings, assuming \u2013 harvesting cash flows from our clean energy initiatives. And most important, I can feel our team\u2019s excitement about coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever before. My thanks to them for another fantastic year. Back to you, Pat.\nJ. Gallagher: Thanks, Doug. Operator, let\u2019s go to questions and answers if we can.\nOperator: Thank you. The call is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening. My first question Doug, I appreciate the color by speaking provide on the expense savings. So as we continue to think about I guess coming out of COVID, I know last quarter, I believe you guys had said, right, kind of when things settled that half of the state could persist and maybe think about some level between half and the $60 million, I guess I\u2019m just talking about brokerage in kind of the middle two quarters of 2021. Do those figures, I guess I would assume that they still seem about right given where we sit today.\nDoug Howell: Yes, I think your recollection is right. It was I did say as, it\u2019s that there was a silver lining coming out of something so terrible, and that\u2019s we\u2019ve learned a lot about ourselves. I think that ultimately we think there\u2019s $125 million to $150 million of annual cost savings that we might, that we\u2019re pulling forward earlier into our continued march on margin improvement. As it emerges for the quarters this year, it really is a kind of a sensitive interplay between organic and then just really what happens with the economy. We\u2019ll follow our customer\u2019s expectations. We are learning that they are much more receptive now to virtual interactions allows to get our niche expertise at the point of sale, easier than jumping on an airplane or in spending days traveling. So we are learning a lot in that, but we will follow our customers\u2019 expectations. How that exactly plays out in the second and third and fourth quarters really depends on how fast organic moves from that 3% to 4% range up into maybe the 5% or 6% range.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the M&A environment, so you guys mentioned, right, you posed a couple of larger deals to end December, right. The two of us, the multiples on the $300 million of revenue within those 30 term sheets that you guys mentioned. Can you just give us a sense like kind of the skew are there any larger ones in there? Or is it more just kind of the typical smaller bolt-on deals that you guys focused on of late as well?\nDoug Howell: Yes, I would say that just clarifying that we had some larger tuck-in ones at the end of the December call in revenues that $20 million, $25 million range. The deal sheets that we\u2019re looking at right now, $300 million of revenue spread across 30, 35 term sheets, they\u2019re in the smaller range, nice local family owned entrepreneurial businesses. The range is lower than where we are right now for year. So I would see us back kind of more where we were in the second, third \u2013 first, second and third quarters.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then can you give us an update on Capsicum, your reinsurance business, I guess, where that sits at the end of the year. How that\u2019s been trending from both a growth and margin perspective?\nDoug Howell: Yes, it\u2019s doing really well. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the team. Pat can talk about some of the cultural excitement that we have on that. But financially, they\u2019re growing in double-digit still; their margins are north of 30%. We see terrific opportunities for that business.\nJ. Gallagher: As you know, this is my second go around. This was a lot better.\nElyse Greenspan: And then one last question, Doug. Is there a chance that there isn\u2019t any kind of extender bill that would extend your ability? I know you gave us a lot of helpful color assuming that you can\u2019t generate any credits beyond the end of this year. Is there a chance that there could be any extended bill or I guess, most likely not at this point?\nDoug Howell: Sure. I always think there\u2019s a chance. And I think that when Congress said about this, about helping us get better in burning some fossil fuel. They wanted help in making it better. So as long as we\u2019re going to be using it, let\u2019s make it better. So I think they see that, and I think they see the opportunity for this to continue to help innovate. So we hope that there\u2019s some \u2013 there are some proposed legislative changes that would \u2013 that possibly could make the extension happen. So we\u2019re hopeful for that. And we certainly are trying to get that message on everybody\u2019s desk that we can.\nElyse Greenspan: Hey, thanks, Doug and Pat for the color.\nJ. Gallagher: Thanks, Elyse.\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Thanks and good afternoon. Thinking about the sales pipeline, I\u2019ve been trying to contemplate, I guess, in my mind, clients would have hunkered down early on in COVID and been less likely to change brokers or to really contemplate a move like that. Does it feel like people are just getting more comfortable with the world we live in today and that\u2019s opening up or when we think about the past from 3% to 4% organic growth to 5% to 6% organic growth? Are we just waiting for the economy to improve and the shops to get in the arms so everyone can get back out there and living.\nJ. Gallagher: Well, Phil, this is Pat. There\u2019s a lot of answers to your question. So let me back up a little bit. First of all, did the clients hunker down? You start with March of last year and the answer, that\u2019s, yes. Having said that they have a lot of needs and a lot of requests, so we were running webinars around COVID return to work all kinds of different as cyber would have you blew my mind, thousands of people signed up. And it was not unusual for us to run a webinar with 5,000 attendees. I mean, I\u2019d never heard of such a thing. So there\u2019s a huge thirst for information, which helped our people, of course, know exactly some of the hot buttons that they should be talking to potential clients and to get out. And I was amazed. I really would have told you that I thought maybe new business would have hunkered down. I didn\u2019t think our lost business would increase because of that. In fact, it\u2019s amazing to me, that kind of new business that we did generate. So I think that it gives us a lot of confidence to sell the kind of business we sold last year. And you\u2019d get some fall over from 2019 into the first quarter, maybe a little in the second quarter, but everything from May on was really generated after the first of the year, so really a incredible new business year. Secondly, are we seeing the advent potentially of people beginning to come back into the businesses? I think, yes. I think we\u2019re seeing that there is going to end whether stimulus happens or not. I think businesses have learned how to do this tick just to look at your local restaurants. And I had a better a year ago, they weren\u2019t March, they might, they\u2019re not going to survive. Take out. It\u2019s not making them robust, but they\u2019re surviving and they\u2019re ready. I mean, in the Chicago land area, now we can go to restaurants again, they have very limited occupancy, but they are ready. They\u2019re welcoming. They want people back and people are excited about it. So I think the pent up demand for people to be able to go do things is also going to be helpful. Then lastly, let\u2019s not forget something. I\u2019ve told you guys this a thousand times, I don\u2019t like hard markets and I get it. They all look good on paper what have you, but they tick every customer off. And they\u2019re suffering through this right now, because they don\u2019t really have a choice. But they are going to shop. And we are there for them to understand that both our data capabilities, as well as our professional niche capabilities and our ability to work them through the process of taking more risk, becoming more self-insured, that's our bread and butter. We're better at that than anybody. So I think that, that is it's all of those combined that leads me to believe that we see a very robust new business year ahead in 2021 and 2022.\nPhil Stefano: Okay. Thanks. And switching gears a bit, I feel like the dividend is something that we don't really talk about, but I was a bit surprised by the extent of the raise in the past week or so. Is there a long-term growth rate that you target a payout ratio, or maybe you can just refresh our understanding on how you think about the dividend?\nJ. Gallagher: Yes, I mean, we just pop it up a little bit more yesterday. We did raise, I think it's an indication that our cash flows are very strong. We typically raise it a few cents and then maybe a little bit more and sit there for a year or so. But I think there was a vote of confidence by the board that said that let's take that dividend up just a little bit more this week. So we did that. And so we'll look at that every year, but we agreed with the observations that cash is strong. So let's increase the dividend.\nPhil Stefano: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.\nMike Zaremski: Good early evening. I guess first question on expenses, I know we've talked about this a lot but it's just \u2013 it's been phenomenal. And so I try to understand do you feel that a lot of these expenses that will persist are kind of more Gallagher\u2019s specific and it'll give you a leg up on your competitors, or like do you feel like a lot of these things are things that just your competitors are going to catch up to you eventually, you're just a kind of first mover. I know that's maybe a complicated question, but just trying to get a sense of whether this kind of gives you a advantage that'll persist versus peers or others just are going to kind of follow you guys, but just will take some time?\nDoug Howell: All right. So let's break this into a couple of things. Let me talk about who our competitor, 90% of the time we're competing with somebody that's smaller than us, right? So when you look at the \u2013 where are we really getting leverage? I think there we're getting leverage because of our scale, especially relative to that, but that level of competitive, the smaller ones that we compete with day in and day out. I think we have opportunities to continue to use our lower cost labor locations and our centers of excellence. I think our ability in order to rationalize our real estate footprint I think that we can buy goods and services cheaper. I think our ability to automate many of the interactions with the clients and with our own employees all of those things, I would say that Gallagher is positioned. We have a common agency management system in most of our countries, in most of our businesses. Those are things that we believe that we will continue to bring scale advantages versus our smaller competitors. How do I feel about it comparing to, let's say the other top 10 brokers, first of all, you got to pick the ones that have the culture that want to work together and make it happen. And then you've got to pick the ones that haven't already gone down this journey to see whether or not there yet or not. But we think that we're in really terrific place to continue to leverage our technologies and our scale compared to most of our competitions. So I don't know if they're catching up or if they're already there or they just don't have the culture to pull it off.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Doug. Did you more straight forward question, free cash flow for 2021, did you site kind of an estimate for what we should expect?\nDoug Howell: I didn't, but I said that we probably could do about up to $2.5 billion in M&A for this year. So if you break that apart, we've got $700 million on hand. And if you look at our operating cash flows being somewhere in the $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion range something like that, I think. And then you borrow a little bit more so that's how you get to the $2.5 billion.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And just lastly curious a broker that reported earnings earlier today, kind of actually talked about stepping on the gas on hiring and taking advantage of some of the M&A that's just taking place in the industry. Just curious, are you seeing any increased opportunities on the hiring side?\nJ. Gallagher: Definitely seeing opportunities from two areas, Doug mentioned that 90% of the time we compete, we compete with smaller brokers and the smaller brokers have the problem of just simply not having the capabilities that clients are starting to ask for. And these can be simple questions, like, how do I know? How do I know you just gave me the best deal? When I was out selling 30 years ago on a daily basis that would be answered by saying, I went to three carriers. This is the best price that does not float today. They want to know what you're doing with clients, what carriers are doing at, where the ranges are, what their loss ratio looks like to bear to others. They want detail, they want data. Smaller people can't do that. So what you've got is folks that are losing accounts to the likes of ourselves, and we're out telling them, why wouldn't you come to a place that's happy to pay you, for what you hunt and kill. And at the same time, you have all the support and the capabilities in the world. We can write any account of any size, no matter where it's located in the world and that's very attractive. And then of course, there's always opportunities as larger competitors, we clearly believe we offer a cultural difference.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question.\nGreg Peters: Good afternoon. Just a follow-up on Mike's question, I don't know, if I missed it in the prepared remarks. The free cash flow for 2020 was what?\nDoug Howell: For 2020, our free cash flow in operating \u2013 free operating cash flow be about $1.4 billion this year in the cash flow statement, when we file our 10-K in a week, you'll see it's around $1.4 billion.\nGreg Peters: And so you said the guidance for 2021 is $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Was there some one-time benefits that floats through in 2020 that you're not going to realize in 2021, otherwise I would normally expect the free cash flow to grow, if you're growing your top line and bottom line, I expect free cash flow to grow. And what am I missing?\nDoug Howell: I don't think it will appreciably change significantly in 2020 versus 2021, we will grow at \u2013 if we hold margins in there, we're going to grow based on not including acquisitions in that number. So if the cash flows off the acquisitions, we will also \u2013 that too\u2026\nGreg Peters: So then just to close the loop on your previous comments, when you said in 2022 that you'll drive, was it $125 million cash benefit from the pull down of the tax credit?\nDoug Howell: In 2022, yes?\nGreg Peters: I can assume whatever free cash flow growth I have off of 2021 on an operating basis. And then just add on an additional $125 million. Is that a fair way to think about it?\nDoug Howell: Yes, if you factor in mergers. Yes, that's a fair way.\nGreg Peters: Okay. The second question I had listen, I know you've comment on this before, and you were sort of dancing around it in the prepared remarks and the Q&A. But you just talked about an 8% rate increase across your entire footprint. And you talked about, terms and conditions being changed \u2013 changing. I'm just curious about your customers and how they're dialing up retentions reducing limits to offset the price. And I guess what I'm really trying to gauge is how does it look here at year end 2020 verse how it was looking at year end 2019?\nJ. Gallagher: Well, I think it's continuing to get stronger, Greg. This is Pat. I think that, look, if we're telling you that, basically we're seeing rate increases of around 8% and organic is about 3.5%. You see a 5% difference where to go. Well it went to modification of what the purchase \u2013 with the purchasers buying. And that's our job. I mean we sit down with these guys and say, men and women, and say, look here are your options, you had $250 million of limits last year. We could show you the stats that would be a very unusual claim to break the $150 million barrier. Do you need that extra $100 million? And we help them work through that. Retentions are a very big part of it. And a big part of it is, and this is where our history comes from, clients that enter self-insurance for the first time. I don't understand this, what's the deal. Well, why don't you take a $150,000 retention and you'll basically save ex on the transaction that you'll only have to pay, if you do have the claims. Now, let\u2019s really focus on loss control. So, I don\u2019t need to get too detailed with you, but that\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s what we do for a living.\nGreg Peters: Right. Well, I guess, what I was \u2013 I had assumed that the difference between the eight and the three was a combination of retentions, reduced limits and reduced economic activity, but maybe, I was overthinking there.\nJ. Gallagher: Okay. That\u2019s fair. That\u2019s fair. Yes, I look out the economic activity. That\u2019s fair.\nGreg Peters: Okay. The final \u2013 I guess the final thing and I know you\u2019ve been talking about M&A, but listen, the dirty little, not so big of a secret is the two \u2013 number two and number three are out there and the merger dance. And it feels like that is an opportunity for dislocation for customers being unhappy for you to bank new hires, et cetera. And so I guess from the time that they announced this thing back in March of last year to now, have you seen anything in the marketplace that\u2019s disruptive that you see as an opportunity or is the disruption, if there is any going come later in this process?\nJ. Gallagher: So Greg, let me, obviously, I\u2019m not going to talk about our competitors and I \u2013 but I\u2019ve said to you many times, change is good for us. And when we move to further consolidation of three players at the top end of the spectrum and our name happens to be one of them, there\u2019s lots and lots, and lots of opportunities along the lines of everything you\u2019re talking about. There\u2019s clients that have never really talked to Gallagher that we\u2019re going to have a shot at. I mean, if you go back in time and I went to the RIMS Conference 100 years ago, nobody came by our booth. We\u2019ve got 5,000 people that show up to our RIMS Conference virtually. I mean, there\u2019s interest. And so really, it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re in a very, very good position.\nGreg Peters: Got it. I probably got a little too cute on the question, sorry about that, but thanks for your answers.\nJ. Gallagher: Sure. Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nYaron Kinar: Hi, good evening. I guess my first question, just trying to tie the organic growth to margins next year. So, I would think there are different ways to get the 4% to 5% organic growth, and each of those potentially, has a very different impact on margins, namely, if you\u2019re getting more of that organic growth through rate versus exposure unit growth. So maybe, you can talk about that a little bit. And then on the flip side, I think in the past you used to talk about, of needing to get at least 3% organic in order to keep margins stable. How should we think about, let\u2019s say a 3% organic growth for \u2013 if you achieve that in 2021, what does that mean for margins?\nDoug Howell: All right. The workload, the difference in workload on a customer that is adding exposure units, i.e. adding vehicles or changing miles, isn\u2019t significant whether they\u2019re adding a couple of failures. So, the workload associated with a rate increase that comes from exposure units. Not that much more. If it comes from additional rate, that means we want to go out and shop more, we\u2019ll take a little bit more effort, but because of our efficiencies, we can do that at a pretty low cost month. So, just the number of policies or the exposure units or a modest rate increase or decrease doesn\u2019t change our workload that much. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that that would have a significant impact on margin if you\u2019re kind of in that 2% to 4% range on rates and exposures. When you\u2019re asking the next part of the question about when \u2013 where do we see the kind of the old tried and true line, if you grow organically 3%, is there margin lift in it? Yes, I think there is, is it \u2013 in this year in 2021, since we were up 400 basis points in margin this year alone, I think that\u2019d be pretty tough to get a 3%.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. So, beyond 2021 though, if you do achieve 3% organic growth, even though the bar is so much higher today, you can still achieve margin improvement even with that.\nDoug Howell: Yes. we\u2019ve moved that to 3% to 4% over the number of years. As our margins are getting over 30%, there\u2019s just not as much there to harvest as our technologies get rolled up. As our scale grows, we\u2019ll be able to have margin improvement on those tuck-in acquisitions that can come onto our chassis can use our technologies. It\u2019s really more about selling more than it is necessarily about making more margin. but there would be upward tick. Do I see that in at 3% organic growth in 2022? I don\u2019t know if we\u2019d have that much more margin expansion.\nYaron Kinar: Okay.\nDoug Howell: Do it for five years in a row. Sure, there could be some.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. And then was this step-up in Gallagher\u2019s margins was a good portion of that being retained. How do you think about the \u2013 about acquisitions and potential targets? I would think that the bar to clear there could be significantly higher that your margins are higher today.\nDoug Howell: If they\u2019re running good margins for the business that they\u2019re in and they show a prospect for growth, we\u2019ll buy them regardless of whether it\u2019s dilutive to all our margin if they come in. they are what they are and if we can improve their margins, terrific; if they\u2019re already at the upper end of the scale, then terrific. But they just happened to be in a space that requires a significant amount of service that maybe, it will say that their margins are 22%, but they have a good growth. We\u2019ll still buy them. And we\u2019ll let you know, we\u2019ve done that in the past, where we\u2019ve said a role in impact of acquisitions had X, Y, or Z impact on our margins.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Thank you.\nDoug Howell: Sure. Thanks, Yaron.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Montemaden with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question.\nDavid Montemaden: Thanks. Good evening. Just a question on P&C exposure units; in the press release, it sounded like, we\u2019re continuing to see an increase in exposure versus April and May 2020, which not a big surprise. but I guess I\u2019m wondering how exposure units were trending thus far this year relative to 4Q, obviously a tough comp year-over-year. but are we continuing to see an improvement in exposure units in 4Q or is it sort of flattened out thus far in January?\nJ. Gallagher: They\u2019re flat in January.\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think that we\u2019ve kind of bounced off the bottom. We\u2019re not seeing significant daily step-up. We are seeing \u2013 we look at our global positive endorsements that go through on our policies on every day. And we can see that that\u2019s still showing a nice upward trend similar to pre-pandemic, but you weren\u2019t seeing massive exposure unit growth a year ago in the \u2013 fourth quarter of 2019 or early into 2020. You weren\u2019t seeing it there. but there is a steady increase. There\u2019s been a bounce off the bottom and we would expect throughout 2021 and 2022 as the economy recovers that those exposure and this would go back up also, but not much different today than let\u2019s say, in December.\nDavid Montemaden: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then I\u2019m just \u2013 I guess I\u2019m wondering, after we\u2019ve gotten through some of the renewals here in January, I guess, are you seeing any movement on the commission rates? And I guess just conversations around contingents and supplementals, maybe, an update on how those are looking.\nJ. Gallagher: Yes. I think that commission rates and the like are solid. We\u2019re not having pressure from our carrier partners to try to diminish their payment to their distributors and as far as contingents and supplemental. So, we think we\u2019ll have a solid year, some growth this year.\nDavid Montemaden: Great, thank you.\nJ. Gallagher: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes of Truist. You may proceed with your question.\nMark Hughes: Thank you. Good afternoon.\nJ. Gallagher: Hi, Mark.\nMark Hughes: Why the rebound in risk management, I wonder if you could break that into pieces, more claims, more employees, new business. How does that shake out?\nJ. Gallagher: Yes. well, I think Doug, if you want to granular to the percent, I can\u2019t do that. but it\u2019s \u2013 you hit right on it, Mark. I mean, we\u2019ve got claims are recovering. We mentioned in our prepared remarks that COVID claims in particular have helped out. The economic activity people are adding more folks and those are the factors that produce claims. So, as we get people driving, as we get people going back to work, they will come back to more normal levels. And we don\u2019t hope to get more COVID claims, but they are filling a hole in the bucket right now.\nDoug Howell: And they had a terrific new business here, too. It\u2019s starting to incept. you saw that we had some. It\u2019s been a couple of million or a million or so on some new client ramp up costs as we transitioned to them. We\u2019ve got a solid outlook for this year of being back and been single digits maybe, this year. So that team has done a terrific job of new business wins too. Didn't hit a ton this year, but it will next year.\nMark Hughes: How are you thinking about the open-broker, it sounds like that was particularly strong in the fourth quarter. Is that continued into Q1?\nJ. Gallagher: Yes, it's continued. It's very strong, Mark. I mean, you understand wholesaling is a business that has an awful lot of market leverage up and down. So we were in a very firm property market, in particular our team. And this is \u2013 what's exciting about this is, these brokers do not want to go to wholesalers. It's not a friendly business in the sense that we're looking to give you one-third of our commission. So they're providing an unbelievable service to the brokerage community, with whom we trade about 15,000 in the United States alone. And those people need help and we're giving them help and that's why along with rate. So we're getting at both in item count and rate just by being ready to be very, very helpful.\nMark Hughes: Thank you.\nJ. Gallagher: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome, [Managing Director]. You may proceed with your question.\nPaul Newsome: Good afternoon. I wanted to ask, tell me a little bit more about your comment, about the lack of shopping by the customers. I mean, I think of a hard market is one with increased shopping, but one of your comments seem to square with every company I cover where the retention levels seem to be really unchanged through the last couple of years. Why do you think we haven't seen the increase in shopping? Why do you think the customers seem to be just kind of taking rate and moving on?\nJ. Gallagher: Well, Paul, again my comment was predicated on two things. To start within the pandemic, I didn't think customers would be having people knocking on their door as much as they do right now. And as much as they did in 2019. And I think that as they started to ferret their way through, what's going to go on in this pandemic themselves, they were willing to very much hunker down and say, I've got a good insurance program, this is where it is. I don't have \u2013 I've got to be considering my own survival tactics. And I surmised there'd be less shopping of our existing business. Now I was right a little bit. It certainly didn't stop shopping. It wasn't like everything came to a grounding halt. But if you're a good broker and we've got really good competition in this market. In our hard market, you early on explained to your client that if you are unhappy with hard market and you want to be really unhappier, shop the hell out of it, because you're going to get slaughtered. And in fact hard market shopping does decreased, pardon me. Unfortunately, as things ease up a bit, people are unhappy and it tends to increased shopping. So right now we're in a very firm and firming market, and people understand that they need our expertise. And it also does scare some of those little competitors that we compete with 90% of the time out of being so bold as to say they can do better than we do, pretty tough to prove it.\nDoug Howell: Yes, I think there's a flight to quality. I think that when you sit down and look at what you get from Gallagher, get more and how do you get more from us? You get price, you get service, you get access, you get creativity, you get innovation. It's pretty hard to leave that if you don't have competition knocking on the door that can offer that. So I think it's a different era from when you and I were cutting our teeth Paul, that it basically as small, small brokers competing with small brokers offering kind of the same thing, you get so much more from Gallagher today, than you ever got before.\nJ. Gallagher: And another thing piling in on that. Once you show someone how to get through these days and primarily by doing what we do so well, which is help people deal with assuming risk, bringing Gallagher Bassett into help pay the claims, mitigating those claims and showing them that in the long term, they've really garnered a lot more control of their destiny. You never lose those clients. A client that moves from the traditional first dollar purchase into any form of self-insurance pooling with other public entities, moving into a group, captive doing their own single parent captive, taking a large retention on their worker's comp in a very heavy employee state. Once you do that for them, it shifts the game completely.\nPaul Newsome: Makes sense. Switching to a different topic. Obviously with the change in the quick tax rates potentially going away, we're probably looking at a change in how we value your company, plus on earnings, more of something else like free cash flow. I guess my question is, is free cash flow the right number, is operating cash flow the right number. I'm just curious is I know their customer usually get intertwined with yours in the measurements and what's your theory on how we should measure cash flow if we have the proper way to do it?\nDoug Howell: Yes. Great. I think that's a terrific question. And all right, first, I still believe that EBITDA gives a good proxy for how to value a broker. Then you just have to back off the cash taxes paid. And interest expense, of course, and the cash tax was paid, an interest shield on that. But if you basically start with EBITDA, you're going to get pretty close to the way, and that's been a traditional way. So what does that mean for Gallagher is that we've said this for years, we're still pay taxes. People sometimes think that we're not paying our fair share. That's not the case at all. We've still pay taxes. It runs about, I said this, if you go back to when tax changed that we are \u2013 we think that we're going to pay in that 5% to 6% to 7% of EBITDA range just as a proxy. We're probably at that same range, even if tax rates go up to 28% from 21%, it would be a book rate differential. It wouldn't really be a cash difference. If the Biden tax measures were put in place, it might cost us 10 million bucks a year in taxes, more Paul, but it wouldn't be a huge number. The value of tax credits become more valuable if tax rates go up. So really for Gallagher to take our EBITDA, back off our CapEx, back off our interest expense and put in 7% or 8% for cash taxes paid and you get pretty close to the cash flow amount for Gallagher. I might've missed something in there, but I think I got most of the pieces in that, but I would start with EBITDA still.\nPaul Newsome: Fantastic. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Paul.\nJ. Gallagher: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. You may proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Good evening. One small question, one big one. Are the claims that you're seeing recover in Gallagher basket, sorry, Gallagher Bassett. Are any of those, like just late reported claims that occurred earlier, or that just now you're seeing more claims because of COVID or because of rising economic activity?\nJ. Gallagher: More claims rising out of better economic activity. And the addition of COVID claims, which was a category that didn't exist a year ago.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. And then bigger picture, Pat, you talked about Gallagher's ability to write any clients to actually win those clients. Didn't need to a more extensive set of consulting services comparable to the brokers that are bigger than you?\nJ. Gallagher: Yes, we do. [indiscernible] I\u2019m sorry when it was?\nMeyer Shields: No. When you said we do, is that we \u2013 the Gallagher has those services or needs them in the same proportion?\nJ. Gallagher: No. No. We do. We've got them. I mean, Doug was going to go down the line. If you take a look at our verticals, our niche capabilities, I mean, we don't stand second to anybody and I can go through the list of those. We provided every time we get a chance, but, you take a public sector client anywhere in the world, you take a college or university we had some great college and university wins in the last month. Names that if I throw them out, which I won't today, you'd go, wow. And I'm talking on a global basis. We'll be probably the largest provider of college and university risk management advice in Australia. So you're not going to be winning those types of accounts. We're very \u2013 we've gotten much stronger in terms of our benefits capabilities. When you take a look at what we do on the consulting work for health and welfare alone, but also all the other human resource needs. I mean, we're clearly a top three consultant in that regard. So, no, I mean, look, we know that over 90% of our business falls include, defined niches, which we have expertise that we think is frankly, better than our large competitors.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much.\nJ. Gallagher: Thanks, Meyer.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I was just hoping, is there any way you can help frame for us what the ceiling on the brokerage organic growth \u2013 brokerage organic margin \u2013 brokerage margin might be?\nJ. Gallagher: Phil, that's a tough question. I'd rather not, but I think that the answer is, it's just such an interplay between organic service expectation by our clients, and then in underlying inflation too that we face every day and certain of that. Right now, we're in a low wage inflation environment. We've kind of been in a low wage inflation environment since really 2007, 2008. We're getting more efficient with scale. Technology costs are coming down; on the other hand there are costs that more specific technical expertise costs more. Getting smarter people on your payroll that can handle some of the really, really technical aspects of what's going on, systems there's cost inflation and systems right now, so it's a tough, tough answer, but you're seeing the brokerage business somehow is running around 30 points plus or minus two points right now. That's the way it's running. You look across Austin and the other large Publix, and you look at the PE owned firms. There's a number around 30% plus or minus a couple of p0oints there.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Fair enough. I figured I'd give it a try. Thank you.\nJ. Gallagher: Thanks Phil.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, you have reached your...\nJ. Gallagher: I think that's all our questions, yes.\nOperator: Yes. I would like to turn it back over to you, Mr. Gallagher for closing remarks.\nJ. Gallagher: Thanks. And thank you again, everyone for joining us this afternoon. We mentioned this in our prepared remarks, but we delivered an excellent quarter and full year, and we all know how difficult the economic environment was. So I would like to thank all of our Gallagher professionals around the globe for being flexible, working hard and never losing focus on our job at hand. I'm competent that we can deliver another great year of financial performance in 2021, and truly believe that as an enterprise, we are just getting started. So thanks for being with us folks. We appreciate it.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Doug Howell",
            "content": "Thanks Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll echo Pat's comments on great quarter and an excellent year. I too would like to extend my appreciation to the team. Today, I'll begin with some comments on our cost savings, provide some, a few observations from our CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. Then I'll do a vignette on our clean energy investments and finish with some thoughts on M&A, cash and liquidity. All right, let's turn to the earnings release, Page 6 to the brokerage EBITDAC table. You'll see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by about $85 million over last year's fourth quarter, resulting in about 580 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $60 million of cost savings relative to fourth quarter 2019 adjusted for merger. So underlying margin expansion was about 115 basis points on 3.1% all-in organic, which on its own is impressive. When you move to Page 8, in Risk Management segment, we grew EBITDAC a bit more than $4 million on slightly positive organic, resulting in about 190 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. Within that, we realized about $5 million of cost savings relative to Q4 2019, which was moderated just a little by new client ramp-up costs. So underlying margins were up just a bit, that too is actually giving the flattish organic this quarter. Categories of fourth quarter savings for the combined brokerage and risk management segment were consistent with second and third quarter. Reduced travel, entertainment and advertising about $25 million, reduced consulting and professional fees $14 million, reduced outside labor and other workforce savings $16 million, office supplies, consumables, and occupancy costs about $10 million. So that total is around $65 million, which is consistent with what we said at our December IR Day. Now looking forward the pace of recovery isn't clear, we came into the year with another virus surge. Now maybe some positive cases coming down. Some areas are imposing more lockdowns yet others are loosening up. There's been some successes but mostly delays in a vaccine rollout. And now it's looking like more and more that's the stimulus might be caught in gridlock here in the U.S. Regardless of whether you're looking at half full or half empty glass, very few outlooks are expecting the business environment to be much different by the end of the first quarter. So for us, when it comes to first quarter 2021, we're inorganic in the 3% to 4% range, and we're seeing expense saving similar to fourth quarter 2020, call it another $600 million \u2013 excuse me, $60 million. If that happens, and we could again show margin expansion over about 500 basis points. Then looking towards second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, it gets a little more tricky when you do your models, because the slope of the recovery is still uncertain and we're getting through \u2013 we're already realizing substantial COVID induced expense savings beginning early in April of 2020. But if the recovery steps up in those quarters and we get back to organic of, say, high 4% or 5%, it does give us a path towards holding full year margins, especially if travel and entertainment remains limited. Now, all of this needs to be taken into context. In 2017, 2018 and 2019, we were expanding margins 50 to 75 basis points a year on organic in that 4% to 5% range. Then the COVID hits, we execute on our cost containment playbook, and still managed to grow organic 3% that pops margins over 400 basis points in the face of this global pandemic. So now what I'm saying is that we have a fighting chance to hold or even improve full year margins here in 2021 on the prospect of getting closer to pre-pandemic organic growth later in the year. To me, that's still about a bullish story as you could write. Now, if we move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website, on Page 2, the blue fourth quarter column, you'll see most of the items are consistent with what we provided during our December IR Day, and that's in the gray column. FX came in a $0.01 better and severance and integration costs also a $0.01 better when you compare that to the prior quarters. Also on Page 2 in the reddish column, we're now providing our quarterly look at 2021, a few comments. First, foreign exchange. With the U.S. dollar weakening and if it stays that way throughout the year, 2021 revenue could see $100 million tailwind in brokerage and $14 million in risk management. Wouldn't be much EPS impact within risk management, but could translate late into a $0.05 or so for our brokerage segment, and that would even be better on reported EBITDA. Second, amortization expense. We're currently forecasting a little over $100 million a quarter in brokerage, which includes all announced mergers to-date. You can see the role in revenues associated with all announced mergers to-date on Page 5. And then also don't forget to adjust your amortization expense in the second and later quarters to reflect any future M&A you might be including in your model. Third, when you look at M&A multiples shown on Page 2 on the last line of the table, like that said, we had an active December closing ten. Three of which were on the larger end of our typical tuck-in size. That pushed the multiple up a tuner so this year, but still creating a nice arbitrage to our trading multiple. More importantly, it brings some really terrific merger partners to the team letting us grow better together over the long-haul. When you move to Page 3 of the CFO commentary in the corporate table, when you compare our December IR Day estimates in the gray column with our fourth quarter results in the blue column, you posted favorable interest expense due to strong cash flows, we had better clean energy earnings, in line M&A expense and a slightly more favorable corporate line. Also on Page 3, we're now providing a first look at 2021 ranges for the corporate segment, and that's in the reddish column. Nothing surprising and there's no change on our outlook for clean energy, still in that $60 million to $75 million of annual after tax earnings we've provided during our IR Day. So this brings me to my vignette on clean energy. You read on Page 4, Note 5 of the CFO commentary document that these investments are winding down at the end of 2021, unless there's an extension. That means in 2022, we will have zero GAAP earnings. But remember, that would be more than replaced with substantial cash flow benefits. In other words, 2021 and prior years were the credit generation years when we report the GAAP benefit or P&L. But 2022 starts the cash harvest years, where we will get considerably larger cash benefits in our operating cash flows. Here's the shortcut way to think about how to compete those cash benefits. First, if you go to Page 14 of the earnings release about the seventh line down in our balance sheet, you'll read that we have a deferred tax asset of over $1 billion, mostly consisting of clean energy credit carry forwards. With one more year of credit generation, that asset should grow by another $100 million. So call it $1.1 billion of credit carry over is by the end of 2021. Then assuming 2022, we will begin using more credits than we've been using thus far. How \u2013 third, then how fast we'll be using those credits will depend on how fast we grow our U.S. taxable income. But for this illustration, and if you assume a seven-year period, it might mean we'd be harvesting about $125 million to $150 million in 2022 with that ramping up to say about $175 million to $200 million in 2028. It's a little odd that GAAP earnings go to zero and then the cash benefits become dramatically better, but that's just how it works. This is and has been a really important part of our story over the last decade. So I think it was worth some extra time today. All right, let me go on to some comments on cash in M&A. At December 31, available cash on hand was nearly $700 million. We have a significant untapped capacity in our \u2013 on our revolving credit facility. And we have another year ahead of us have really strong cash flows. That might mean that we would have perhaps two point \u2013 up to $2.5 billion of M&A capacity here in 2021. That's a terrific position as we come into our year that we see as perhaps the most active year ever in the brokerage M&A space. Okay. That's wraps up 2020 and we're positioned really well for 2021. Organic looks better, bolt-on M&A, it looks better. We have a decent chance of keeping a large chunk of our cost savings, assuming \u2013 harvesting cash flows from our clean energy initiatives. And most important, I can feel our team's excitement about coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever before. My thanks to them for another fantastic year. Back to you, Pat. Yes, I think your recollection is right. It was I did say as, it's that there was a silver lining coming out of something so terrible, and that's we've learned a lot about ourselves. I think that ultimately we think there's $125 million to $150 million of annual cost savings that we might, that we're pulling forward earlier into our continued march on margin improvement. As it emerges for the quarters this year, it really is a kind of a sensitive interplay between organic and then just really what happens with the economy. We'll follow our customer's expectations. We are learning that they are much more receptive now to virtual interactions allows to get our niche expertise at the point of sale, easier than jumping on an airplane or in spending days traveling. So we are learning a lot in that, but we will follow our customers' expectations. How that exactly plays out in the second and third and fourth quarters really depends on how fast organic moves from that 3% to 4% range up into maybe the 5% or 6% range. Yes, I would say that just clarifying that we had some larger tuck-in ones at the end of the December call in revenues that $20 million, $25 million range. The deal sheets that we're looking at right now, $300 million of revenue spread across 30, 35 term sheets, they're in the smaller range, nice local family owned entrepreneurial businesses. The range is lower than where we are right now for year. So I would see us back kind of more where we were in the second, third \u2013 first, second and third quarters. Yes, it's doing really well. We couldn't be more pleased with the team. Pat can talk about some of the cultural excitement that we have on that. But financially, they're growing in double-digit still; their margins are north of 30%. We see terrific opportunities for that business. Sure. I always think there's a chance. And I think that when Congress said about this, about helping us get better in burning some fossil fuel. They wanted help in making it better. So as long as we're going to be using it, let's make it better. So I think they see that, and I think they see the opportunity for this to continue to help innovate. So we hope that there's some \u2013 there are some proposed legislative changes that would \u2013 that possibly could make the extension happen. So we're hopeful for that. And we certainly are trying to get that message on everybody's desk that we can. Thanks, Elyse. All right. So let's break this into a couple of things. Let me talk about who our competitor, 90% of the time we're competing with somebody that's smaller than us, right? So when you look at the \u2013 where are we really getting leverage? I think there we're getting leverage because of our scale, especially relative to that, but that level of competitive, the smaller ones that we compete with day in and day out. I think we have opportunities to continue to use our lower cost labor locations and our centers of excellence. I think our ability in order to rationalize our real estate footprint I think that we can buy goods and services cheaper. I think our ability to automate many of the interactions with the clients and with our own employees all of those things, I would say that Gallagher is positioned. We have a common agency management system in most of our countries, in most of our businesses. Those are things that we believe that we will continue to bring scale advantages versus our smaller competitors. How do I feel about it comparing to, let's say the other top 10 brokers, first of all, you got to pick the ones that have the culture that want to work together and make it happen. And then you've got to pick the ones that haven't already gone down this journey to see whether or not there yet or not. But we think that we're in really terrific place to continue to leverage our technologies and our scale compared to most of our competitions. So I don't know if they're catching up or if they're already there or they just don't have the culture to pull it off. I didn't, but I said that we probably could do about up to $2.5 billion in M&A for this year. So if you break that apart, we've got $700 million on hand. And if you look at our operating cash flows being somewhere in the $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion range something like that, I think. And then you borrow a little bit more so that's how you get to the $2.5 billion. For 2020, our free cash flow in operating \u2013 free operating cash flow be about $1.4 billion this year in the cash flow statement, when we file our 10-K in a week, you'll see it's around $1.4 billion. I don't think it will appreciably change significantly in 2020 versus 2021, we will grow at \u2013 if we hold margins in there, we're going to grow based on not including acquisitions in that number. So if the cash flows off the acquisitions, we will also \u2013 that too... In 2022, yes? Yes, if you factor in mergers. Yes, that's a fair way. All right. The workload, the difference in workload on a customer that is adding exposure units, i.e. adding vehicles or changing miles, isn't significant whether they're adding a couple of failures. So, the workload associated with a rate increase that comes from exposure units. Not that much more. If it comes from additional rate, that means we want to go out and shop more, we'll take a little bit more effort, but because of our efficiencies, we can do that at a pretty low cost month. So, just the number of policies or the exposure units or a modest rate increase or decrease doesn't change our workload that much. So, I wouldn't say that that would have a significant impact on margin if you're kind of in that 2% to 4% range on rates and exposures. When you're asking the next part of the question about when \u2013 where do we see the kind of the old tried and true line, if you grow organically 3%, is there margin lift in it? Yes, I think there is, is it \u2013 in this year in 2021, since we were up 400 basis points in margin this year alone, I think that'd be pretty tough to get a 3%. Yes. we've moved that to 3% to 4% over the number of years. As our margins are getting over 30%, there's just not as much there to harvest as our technologies get rolled up. As our scale grows, we'll be able to have margin improvement on those tuck-in acquisitions that can come onto our chassis can use our technologies. It's really more about selling more than it is necessarily about making more margin. but there would be upward tick. Do I see that in at 3% organic growth in 2022? I don't know if we'd have that much more margin expansion. Do it for five years in a row. Sure, there could be some. If they're running good margins for the business that they're in and they show a prospect for growth, we'll buy them regardless of whether it's dilutive to all our margin if they come in. they are what they are and if we can improve their margins, terrific; if they're already at the upper end of the scale, then terrific. But they just happened to be in a space that requires a significant amount of service that maybe, it will say that their margins are 22%, but they have a good growth. We'll still buy them. And we'll let you know, we've done that in the past, where we've said a role in impact of acquisitions had X, Y, or Z impact on our margins. Sure. Thanks, Yaron. Yes. I think that we've kind of bounced off the bottom. We're not seeing significant daily step-up. We are seeing \u2013 we look at our global positive endorsements that go through on our policies on every day. And we can see that that's still showing a nice upward trend similar to pre-pandemic, but you weren't seeing massive exposure unit growth a year ago in the \u2013 fourth quarter of 2019 or early into 2020. You weren't seeing it there. but there is a steady increase. There's been a bounce off the bottom and we would expect throughout 2021 and 2022 as the economy recovers that those exposure and this would go back up also, but not much different today than let's say, in December. And they had a terrific new business here, too. It's starting to incept. you saw that we had some. It's been a couple of million or a million or so on some new client ramp up costs as we transitioned to them. We've got a solid outlook for this year of being back and been single digits maybe, this year. So that team has done a terrific job of new business wins too. Didn't hit a ton this year, but it will next year. Yes, I think there's a flight to quality. I think that when you sit down and look at what you get from Gallagher, get more and how do you get more from us? You get price, you get service, you get access, you get creativity, you get innovation. It's pretty hard to leave that if you don't have competition knocking on the door that can offer that. So I think it's a different era from when you and I were cutting our teeth Paul, that it basically as small, small brokers competing with small brokers offering kind of the same thing, you get so much more from Gallagher today, than you ever got before. Yes. Great. I think that's a terrific question. And all right, first, I still believe that EBITDA gives a good proxy for how to value a broker. Then you just have to back off the cash taxes paid. And interest expense, of course, and the cash tax was paid, an interest shield on that. But if you basically start with EBITDA, you're going to get pretty close to the way, and that's been a traditional way. So what does that mean for Gallagher is that we've said this for years, we're still pay taxes. People sometimes think that we're not paying our fair share. That's not the case at all. We've still pay taxes. It runs about, I said this, if you go back to when tax changed that we are \u2013 we think that we're going to pay in that 5% to 6% to 7% of EBITDA range just as a proxy. We're probably at that same range, even if tax rates go up to 28% from 21%, it would be a book rate differential. It wouldn't really be a cash difference. If the Biden tax measures were put in place, it might cost us 10 million bucks a year in taxes, more Paul, but it wouldn't be a huge number. The value of tax credits become more valuable if tax rates go up. So really for Gallagher to take our EBITDA, back off our CapEx, back off our interest expense and put in 7% or 8% for cash taxes paid and you get pretty close to the cash flow amount for Gallagher. I might've missed something in there, but I think I got most of the pieces in that, but I would start with EBITDA still. Thanks, Paul."

            "name": "J. Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the Heads of our Operating Divisions. Before we get started, I'd like to make a few comments regarding the tumultuous year that was 2020. It was a year that tested everything from our physical health to our mental state of mind to how we see one another is impacted our colleagues, our families, our communities around the world. They brought personal hardship and loss, stresses and challenges that none of us would have predicted a year ago. I believe we've learned a lot about ourselves and our society over the past year and while 2020 is behind us many issues and difficulties remain, but let's not forget 2020 also showed us that the world can work together towards a common goal to develop vaccines in order to solve a global problem. And for that, I'm both thankful and I remain optimistic about our future. Now onto the discussion of the quarter and year. We delivered an excellent fourth quarter in the midst of the pandemic. We grew organically. We picked up momentum and grew through acquisitions. We improved our productivity and raised our quality. We continued to invest in our bedrock culture. I'm extremely proud of how the team performed during the quarter and the full year. In our Brokerage segment, fourth quarter reported revenue growth was a positive 3.6%. Most of that or 3.1% was organic revenue growth. We executed on our cost containment playbook and further utilized our centers of excellence saving about $60 million in the quarter, helping drive our net earnings margin higher by 281 basis points and expanding our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 579 basis points and net earnings were up 33% and adjusted EBITDAC was up 30%, another fantastic quarter for the Brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and give you some sound bites about each of our brokerage units, starting with our PC operations. In U.S. retail, organic growth was strong at about 4.5%. New business and client retention was similar to last year's fourth quarter and mid-term policy modifications, including full policy cancellations, were slightly better than prior year levels. In our U.S. wholesale operations, risk placement services organic was about 5%, open brokerage organic was more than 20% due to strong renewals fueled by double digit rate increases. Our MGA programs binding businesses were up about 2%, retention was better sequentially, but as expected new business wins are still lagging given the economy. Moving to the UK, around 4.5% organic for the quarter in both our retail and specialty operations, new and lost business was consistent with prior year and special mention to our aviation team. They performed well in their largest quarter of the year helping clients navigate exposures that were down significantly, call it 30% to 40%, and rate increases that pushed premiums close to pre-COVID levels. Australia and New Zealand combined posted organic of about 1%. The spread between new and lost business was similar to last year, but we're not getting as much lift from rate and exposure as we had in previous years. And finally, our Canadian retail operations posted organic of 13%, another terrific new business quarter combined with a nice tick-up in client retention and strong rate environment. So, overall, our global PC operations posted 4.5% organic, which is a bit better than the 4% we discussed at our December Investor Day. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business, fourth quarter organic was around minus 2%, which is at the favorable end of what we thought during our December IR Day. Similar to the previous couple of quarters fees from consulting arrangements and special project work were down. However, revenue from our traditional health and welfare business continues to hold up, with slightly positive fourth quarter organic, which is an encouraging sign. So, when I bring PC and benefits together, total brokerage segment, organic of 3.1%, a really strong quarter in this environment. And even better when you consider the tough compare against the fourth quarter of 2019 of over 6%. Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market, starting the rate environment. Global PC rates continued to march higher during the fourth quarter and overall. Rate was up around 8% across our footprint. Rates in Canada led the way up more than 12%. The U.S. was up more than 8% with wholesale stronger than retail, including rate increases of 15% within our wholesale open brokerage operations, followed by the UK, including London Specialty at about 5% and Australia and New Zealand combined in the low single digits.  By line of business property and professional liability are up 12%, other casually lines are up mid-to-high single digits and worker's comp was flat to modestly positive. Not only are PC rates, continuing to rise terms and conditions are tightening and capacity is becoming increasingly constrained for some coverages. Nearly every area and line of business is firm or firming. And there are even a few lines that are very hard, like umbrella, cyber and public company D&O. So needless to say, it is a difficult PC environment. This is where our teams excel, helping businesses, many of which are still struggling, navigate the market through creative program design, shopping coverages, and altering programs with increasing deductibles or reduced limits to help their risk management programs fit their budgets. Looking forward, I see similar PC market conditions continuing in 2021. And while economic growth is coming, the pace of the recovery remains uncertain. So we remain laser-focused on what we can control, delivering the very best insurance and risk management advice. Now successfully doing this virtually more than ever before, constantly improving our high-quality customer service, engaging with new prospects and growing our new business pipeline. Thus far in January, full policy cancellations and other midterm policy adjustments are trending similar to January 2020. Although it's still early, we're seeing year-over-year, renewal premium increases at levels comparable to fourth quarter 2020. On the benefit side, the annual enrollment season is behind us. And for many of our clients we saw covered lives stabilize from last year's declines, while retention in new business were similar to pre-COVID levels. In addition, a few of our benefits consulting practices are seeing increased activity and engagements early on in the year. So, while there's a lot of year left, these early January indications give me further conviction that full year 2021 Brokerage segment organic will be even better than 3.2% we delivered in 2020. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions, following an active December, we finished the fourth quarter with 10 completed brokerage mergers representing about a $100 million of estimated annualized revenues. And we've announced a handful more so far in January, representing an additional $85 million of estimated annualized revenues. This includes The Bollington merger in the UK, which we think will close in early February after receiving regulatory approval this week. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us. And I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our M&A pipeline, we have 30 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $300 million of annualized revenues. We believe we are the platform of choice for successful entrepreneurs looking to take their business to the next level, by leveraging our niche expertise, our tools and data, in addition to being a great place for their employees to advance their careers. We expect to have a very active 2021, particularly in the U.S. due to concerns related to possible tax changes. So, to wrap up the Brokerage segment for the full year, we delivered 5.4% growth in revenue, 3.2%, all-in organic growth. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 418 basis points, fueled by cost savings of about $180 million. And we completed 27 mergers representing about $250 million of estimated annualized revenue, a fantastic year for the brokerage team. Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter, organic edged back into positive territory, nicely surpassing our December expectations of being down as much as 2%, with some positive lift due to increasing COVID-related workers' compensation claims and saw strong retention in new business. So we ended 2020 with full year organic of minus 2.7%. And this environment to close a year in which core claim counts were down double-digits for more than 10 months of the year. And after posting 10% organic decline in the second quarter alone is a just terrific recovery story. Going back to April in the beginning of the pandemic, we set our sites on delivering full year 2020 adjusted EBITDAC, similar to 2019, even with full year revenues forecasted to be down $38 million or more. And boy, that the team deliver, the team proactively manage this workforce carefully rebalanced claim loads across adjusters and implemented expense controls, ultimately driving 2020 adjusted EBITDAC of nearly $150 million, $4 million better than 2019. Being able to grow full year EBITDAC despite organic revenues that were backwards. It's just fantastic work by the risk management team. As we look forward, January claim counts are trending very similar to the fourth quarter with many clients operating still at partial capacity with new business sold in 2020, incepting over the next few quarters and still room for substantial job recovery. We believe full year 2021 organic will be closer to pre-COVID levels in the mid single-digit range. Let me wrap up with some comments regarding our unique and resilient Gallagher culture. Culture guides our organization, our people in both good times and even more so in demanding times. And I believe culture is the source of our perseverance, our determination, and our constant push for excellence. I'm extremely proud of our collective successes during 2020, but more importantly, how we came together to work as a team, even while physically apart, our culture has never been better and I believe we're ending 2021 even stronger. Okay, I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thanks, Doug. Operator, let's go to questions and answers if we can. As you know, this is my second go around. This was a lot better. Thanks, Elyse. Well, Phil, this is Pat. There's a lot of answers to your question. So let me back up a little bit. First of all, did the clients hunker down? You start with March of last year and the answer, that's, yes. Having said that they have a lot of needs and a lot of requests, so we were running webinars around COVID return to work all kinds of different as cyber would have you blew my mind, thousands of people signed up. And it was not unusual for us to run a webinar with 5,000 attendees. I mean, I'd never heard of such a thing. So there's a huge thirst for information, which helped our people, of course, know exactly some of the hot buttons that they should be talking to potential clients and to get out. And I was amazed. I really would have told you that I thought maybe new business would have hunkered down. I didn't think our lost business would increase because of that. In fact, it's amazing to me, that kind of new business that we did generate. So I think that it gives us a lot of confidence to sell the kind of business we sold last year. And you'd get some fall over from 2019 into the first quarter, maybe a little in the second quarter, but everything from May on was really generated after the first of the year, so really a incredible new business year. Secondly, are we seeing the advent potentially of people beginning to come back into the businesses? I think, yes. I think we're seeing that there is going to end whether stimulus happens or not. I think businesses have learned how to do this tick just to look at your local restaurants. And I had a better a year ago, they weren't March, they might, they're not going to survive. Take out. It's not making them robust, but they're surviving and they're ready. I mean, in the Chicago land area, now we can go to restaurants again, they have very limited occupancy, but they are ready. They're welcoming. They want people back and people are excited about it. So I think the pent up demand for people to be able to go do things is also going to be helpful. Then lastly, let's not forget something. I've told you guys this a thousand times, I don't like hard markets and I get it. They all look good on paper what have you, but they tick every customer off. And they're suffering through this right now, because they don't really have a choice. But they are going to shop. And we are there for them to understand that both our data capabilities, as well as our professional niche capabilities and our ability to work them through the process of taking more risk, becoming more self-insured, that's our bread and butter. We're better at that than anybody. So I think that, that is it's all of those combined that leads me to believe that we see a very robust new business year ahead in 2021 and 2022. Yes, I mean, we just pop it up a little bit more yesterday. We did raise, I think it's an indication that our cash flows are very strong. We typically raise it a few cents and then maybe a little bit more and sit there for a year or so. But I think there was a vote of confidence by the board that said that let's take that dividend up just a little bit more this week. So we did that. And so we'll look at that every year, but we agreed with the observations that cash is strong. So let's increase the dividend. Definitely seeing opportunities from two areas, Doug mentioned that 90% of the time we compete, we compete with smaller brokers and the smaller brokers have the problem of just simply not having the capabilities that clients are starting to ask for. And these can be simple questions, like, how do I know? How do I know you just gave me the best deal? When I was out selling 30 years ago on a daily basis that would be answered by saying, I went to three carriers. This is the best price that does not float today. They want to know what you're doing with clients, what carriers are doing at, where the ranges are, what their loss ratio looks like to bear to others. They want detail, they want data. Smaller people can't do that. So what you've got is folks that are losing accounts to the likes of ourselves, and we're out telling them, why wouldn't you come to a place that's happy to pay you, for what you hunt and kill. And at the same time, you have all the support and the capabilities in the world. We can write any account of any size, no matter where it's located in the world and that's very attractive. And then of course, there's always opportunities as larger competitors, we clearly believe we offer a cultural difference. Well, I think it's continuing to get stronger, Greg. This is Pat. I think that, look, if we're telling you that, basically we're seeing rate increases of around 8% and organic is about 3.5%. You see a 5% difference where to go. Well it went to modification of what the purchase \u2013 with the purchasers buying. And that's our job. I mean we sit down with these guys and say, men and women, and say, look here are your options, you had $250 million of limits last year. We could show you the stats that would be a very unusual claim to break the $150 million barrier. Do you need that extra $100 million? And we help them work through that. Retentions are a very big part of it. And a big part of it is, and this is where our history comes from, clients that enter self-insurance for the first time. I don't understand this, what's the deal. Well, why don't you take a $150,000 retention and you'll basically save ex on the transaction that you'll only have to pay, if you do have the claims. Now, let's really focus on loss control. So, I don't need to get too detailed with you, but that's really \u2013 that's what we do for a living. Okay. That's fair. That's fair. Yes, I look out the economic activity. That's fair. So Greg, let me, obviously, I'm not going to talk about our competitors and I \u2013 but I've said to you many times, change is good for us. And when we move to further consolidation of three players at the top end of the spectrum and our name happens to be one of them, there's lots and lots, and lots of opportunities along the lines of everything you're talking about. There's clients that have never really talked to Gallagher that we're going to have a shot at. I mean, if you go back in time and I went to the RIMS Conference 100 years ago, nobody came by our booth. We've got 5,000 people that show up to our RIMS Conference virtually. I mean, there's interest. And so really, it's \u2013 we're in a very, very good position. Sure. Thanks, Greg. They're flat in January. Yes. I think that commission rates and the like are solid. We're not having pressure from our carrier partners to try to diminish their payment to their distributors and as far as contingents and supplemental. So, we think we'll have a solid year, some growth this year. Thanks, David. Hi, Mark. Yes. well, I think Doug, if you want to granular to the percent, I can't do that. but it's \u2013 you hit right on it, Mark. I mean, we've got claims are recovering. We mentioned in our prepared remarks that COVID claims in particular have helped out. The economic activity people are adding more folks and those are the factors that produce claims. So, as we get people driving, as we get people going back to work, they will come back to more normal levels. And we don't hope to get more COVID claims, but they are filling a hole in the bucket right now. Yes, it's continued. It's very strong, Mark. I mean, you understand wholesaling is a business that has an awful lot of market leverage up and down. So we were in a very firm property market, in particular our team. And this is \u2013 what's exciting about this is, these brokers do not want to go to wholesalers. It's not a friendly business in the sense that we're looking to give you one-third of our commission. So they're providing an unbelievable service to the brokerage community, with whom we trade about 15,000 in the United States alone. And those people need help and we're giving them help and that's why along with rate. So we're getting at both in item count and rate just by being ready to be very, very helpful. Thanks Mark. Well, Paul, again my comment was predicated on two things. To start within the pandemic, I didn't think customers would be having people knocking on their door as much as they do right now. And as much as they did in 2019. And I think that as they started to ferret their way through, what's going to go on in this pandemic themselves, they were willing to very much hunker down and say, I've got a good insurance program, this is where it is. I don't have \u2013 I've got to be considering my own survival tactics. And I surmised there'd be less shopping of our existing business. Now I was right a little bit. It certainly didn't stop shopping. It wasn't like everything came to a grounding halt. But if you're a good broker and we've got really good competition in this market. In our hard market, you early on explained to your client that if you are unhappy with hard market and you want to be really unhappier, shop the hell out of it, because you're going to get slaughtered. And in fact hard market shopping does decreased, pardon me. Unfortunately, as things ease up a bit, people are unhappy and it tends to increased shopping. So right now we're in a very firm and firming market, and people understand that they need our expertise. And it also does scare some of those little competitors that we compete with 90% of the time out of being so bold as to say they can do better than we do, pretty tough to prove it. And another thing piling in on that. Once you show someone how to get through these days and primarily by doing what we do so well, which is help people deal with assuming risk, bringing Gallagher Bassett into help pay the claims, mitigating those claims and showing them that in the long term, they've really garnered a lot more control of their destiny. You never lose those clients. A client that moves from the traditional first dollar purchase into any form of self-insurance pooling with other public entities, moving into a group, captive doing their own single parent captive, taking a large retention on their worker's comp in a very heavy employee state. Once you do that for them, it shifts the game completely. Thanks, Paul. More claims rising out of better economic activity. And the addition of COVID claims, which was a category that didn't exist a year ago. Yes, we do. [indiscernible] I'm sorry when it was? No. No. We do. We've got them. I mean, Doug was going to go down the line. If you take a look at our verticals, our niche capabilities, I mean, we don't stand second to anybody and I can go through the list of those. We provided every time we get a chance, but, you take a public sector client anywhere in the world, you take a college or university we had some great college and university wins in the last month. Names that if I throw them out, which I won't today, you'd go, wow. And I'm talking on a global basis. We'll be probably the largest provider of college and university risk management advice in Australia. So you're not going to be winning those types of accounts. We're very \u2013 we've gotten much stronger in terms of our benefits capabilities. When you take a look at what we do on the consulting work for health and welfare alone, but also all the other human resource needs. I mean, we're clearly a top three consultant in that regard. So, no, I mean, look, we know that over 90% of our business falls include, defined niches, which we have expertise that we think is frankly, better than our large competitors. Thanks, Meyer. Phil, that's a tough question. I'd rather not, but I think that the answer is, it's just such an interplay between organic service expectation by our clients, and then in underlying inflation too that we face every day and certain of that. Right now, we're in a low wage inflation environment. We've kind of been in a low wage inflation environment since really 2007, 2008. We're getting more efficient with scale. Technology costs are coming down; on the other hand there are costs that more specific technical expertise costs more. Getting smarter people on your payroll that can handle some of the really, really technical aspects of what's going on, systems there's cost inflation and systems right now, so it's a tough, tough answer, but you're seeing the brokerage business somehow is running around 30 points plus or minus two points right now. That's the way it's running. You look across Austin and the other large Publix, and you look at the PE owned firms. There's a number around 30% plus or minus a couple of p0oints there. Thanks Phil. I think that's all our questions, yes. Thanks. And thank you again, everyone for joining us this afternoon. We mentioned this in our prepared remarks, but we delivered an excellent quarter and full year, and we all know how difficult the economic environment was. So I would like to thank all of our Gallagher professionals around the globe for being flexible, working hard and never losing focus on our job at hand. I'm competent that we can deliver another great year of financial performance in 2021, and truly believe that as an enterprise, we are just getting started. So thanks for being with us folks. We appreciate it."

It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Also on the call today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We delivered a very strong third quarter. Despite the current global health crisis and the related economic slowdown resulting from COVID-19, our teams continue to execute at the highest levels. While we continue to place health and safety first, we are selling new business, we are servicing and retaining our clients, we continue to look at merger and acquisition opportunities and our bedrock culture keeps us working together even while physically apart. These are times when our global capabilities, niche expertise and product specialists support our local professionals as they help our customers navigate these challenging times. I\u2019d like to thank our 30,000-plus Gallagher professionals for their efforts and relentless focus on delivering the very best Insurance Brokerage, Consulting and Risk Management services our customers. That is the Gallagher way. Moving to our third quarter financial performance. We grew our combined Brokerage and Risk Management revenues in the third quarter organically and through mergers and acquisitions, and together with our expense control efforts, delivered excellent growth in EBITDAC and net earnings. These results demonstrate our operating flexibility, which has enabled us to quickly adjust our expense base, optimize our workforce, improve our productivity while also raising our quality. Let me break down our results further, starting with our brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was a positive 8.3%. Of that, more than half or 4.2% was organic revenue growth. We did have some favorable timing, I\u2019ll discuss that more in a minute. Net earnings margin was up 334 basis points, and adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 632 basis points to 33.4%. Net earnings up 37% and adjusted EBITDAC up 32%, so another excellent quarter during a global pandemic, a fantastic job by the team. Let me walk you around the world and give you some sound bites about each of our brokerage units, and I\u2019ll start with our P/C operations. In U.S. retail, another strong quarter with organic growth of about 4%. We saw solid new business and slightly better retention versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Rate increases are more than offsetting exposure unit declines, midterm policy modifications, including full policy cancellations, are similar to prior year levels. And our U.S. wholesale operations, risk placement services, organic was 8% and our open brokerage business even better than that, while our MGA program binding businesses returned to positive organic in the quarter. Hereto, rate increases are more than offsetting exposure unit declines. Moving to the UK. Around 2% base organic with stronger growth in our London specialty business due to firmer pricing. In Australia and New Zealand combined, also around 2% organic, with New Zealand slightly stronger than Australia. New business is down a touch in Australia and up in New Zealand. Rate increases there remain positive, but not enough to offset exposure decline. And finally, our Canadian retail operations posted organic of 8%, another terrific new business quarter and stable client retention. So overall, our global P/C operations reported about 4% organic in the quarter, again, an excellent result in a difficult environment and on the higher end of our mid-September expectations. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business, third quarter organic was positive 6%. This includes a large life insurance pension funding product sale that we expected to close in the fourth quarter. Otherwise, new consulting and special project work remains soft, while covered lives under employer-sponsored health plans continue to be more resilient than headline unemployment numbers. So when I bring P/C and benefits together, organic of 4.2% and even allowing for the big benefits win, a great quarter. Looking forward to our fourth quarter. First, recall we had a terrific fourth quarter last year, 6% plus organic, so we\u2019re starting off with a tough compare. Second, I just discussed some favorable timing here in the third quarter, so I don\u2019t see us hitting 4% again. But thus far in October, P/C retentions, new business, full policy cancellations and other midterm policy adjustments are in line to slightly better than the third quarter, so perhaps we can read nicely in the 2% to 3% range. That would deliver a full year 2020 around 3% organic, which will be a great year in this environment. While there is still a lot of economic and governmental uncertainty which makes forecasting organic a challenge, we can control what we spend. We\u2019ve demonstrated over the last seven months that we can execute on our cost containment playbook that makes us highly confident we can deliver another quarter and full year of really strong EBITDAC growth. Now let me give you an update on the P/C rate environment. Rate again continued to move higher around the globe during the third quarter. Globally, caught up nearly 7% with tighter terms and conditions and increasingly restrained capacity. By geography, Canada has seen the greatest rate increases, up more than 9%; the U.S. is up about 8%; followed by the UK, including London specialty at about 6%; and Australia and New Zealand, around 3%. By line of business, property remains the strongest, up 12%; next is professional liability, up over 10%; other casualty lines are up 5% to 10%, with umbrella rate increases at least twice that level; and workers\u2019 compensation is flat. So while P/C rates are moving higher, the total amount of premium increases our clients are paying are more modest. This is a result of reduced exposure units, higher deductibles, lower limits and clients opting out of coverages. Looking forward, October results are already indicating continued increases during the fourth quarter, and the carriers in the face of catastrophe, the pandemic, rising casualty loss cost, low investment returns, are making a case for firm rates to persist. But remember, that\u2019s where we excel. Our job is to make sure our clients get a well-structured insurance program at a fair price. Regardless, it is certainly a more difficult market today than last quarter, and we are seeing some pockets of a hard market in certain lines and geographies. I see that continuing into 2021, next year, organic should be better than we are seeing this year play out. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We completed five brokerage mergers during the third quarter at fair multiples. I\u2019d like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our M&A pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $350 million of annualized revenues, and our pipeline continues to grow. Difficult market conditions in the pandemic are further highlighting the need for expertise and data-driven tools. Our platform is an excellent fit for entrepreneurs looking to support their current clients, use our tools and data to grow their businesses and advance their employees\u2019 careers. Right now, it feels like it will be a more active finish to the year as merger prospects have concerns over possible 2021 tax change. Next, I\u2019d like to move to our risk management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic revenue at minus 5.3% was a bit better than what we said at our September IR day. This is a really nice sequential improvement from second quarter organic being down nearly 10%. And our risk management team also did a fantastic job managing its workforce and controlling costs, delivering third quarter adjusted EBITDAC higher than last year by $1 million. Looking forward, we are seeing October claim counts trending similar to September. While we have experienced a steady climb out of the second quarter bottom, many clients are still operating at partial capacity in claim counts have not yet fully rebounded to last year\u2019s levels. So we\u2019re seeing fourth quarter organic revenues in our Risk Management segment, similar or slightly better than third quarter. And just like our Brokerage segment, we expect to grow our EBITDAC again in the fourth quarter due to expense savings. That means we should deliver on our goal of full year 2020 adjusted EBITDAC coming in better than 2019. That\u2019s just an amazing job by the team. Before I pass it to Doug, I\u2019ll finish with some comments on our bedrock culture. Despite the pandemic challenges, our global colleagues, together as a team, continued to deliver the very best service, expertise and advice to our clients. I believe it\u2019s our unique Gallagher culture that is guiding our team through these challenging times. Specifically, I\u2019m reminded of tenet number 20 of the Gallagher way, we run to our clients\u2019 problems, not away from them. Since my grandfather started the company more than 90 years ago, our people have been solving problems and working hard for clients in both easier and more difficult times. And I can tell you this about our culture, it will guide us through the global pandemic, hurricanes, wildfires and any other obstacle in front of us. Throughout Gallagher\u2019s history, we have emerged as a better, more cohesive company. I believe we will emerge from today\u2019s difficult environment stronger than ever. Okay. I\u2019ll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Like Pat said, another excellent quarter. I, too, would like to extend my appreciation to all of our Gallagher colleagues around the globe, what a remarkable job you are doing in these challenging times, servicing our clients, generating new business, all the while executing our cost control playbook. Today, I\u2019ll begin with some comments on organic and the interplay with our cost saving. That seemed to get a lot of questions during our July earnings call and again during our September Investor Day call, so I\u2019ll spend a little more time on that today. I will then provide a few observations from our CFO Commentary document and finish with some thoughts on M&A, cash and liquidity. So all right, let\u2019s go to the earnings release, Page 4, to the brokerage organic table. Now as Pat said, a great quarter with 4.2% all in organic, which equates to about $50 million of organic growth. Then, when you turn to Page 6 to the brokerage EBITDAC table, you see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by $105 million this quarter. So how do we deliver that $105 million on $50 million of organic? First, about $13 million of EBITDAC came from M&A, net of divestitures. Next, a bit over $30 million came from that $50 million of organic. So that means we saved about $60 million from our cost control playbook. From a margin perspective, all in, we grew adjusted EBITDAC margin about 630 basis points. And then when you do the math, you\u2019ll see that even without the additional expense savings, we expanded margin about 150 basis points, which is impressive in and by itself. In the Risk Management segment, a little easier to compute. Revenues were backwards about $10 million, but EBITDAC grew about $1 million, so cost savings were about $11 million. Combine both segments, you get about $70 million of cost savings, which is at the top end of our estimates provided during our September IR Day and close to what we saved in the second quarter. Let me give you a breakdown of these savings: reduced travel, entertainment and advertising, down about $26 million; reduced consulting and professional fees, down $15 million; reduced outside labor and other workforce actions, $14 million; reduced office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs, about $11 million; and reduced employee benefit and medical plan costs about $4 million. Now when I look towards the fourth quarter, we\u2019re starting to see a slight increase in our producers traveling more to see clients and prospects. We are executing on some targeted marketing and advertising programs and our medical plan utilization continues to return to pre-pandemic levels. But even with that, we\u2019re still seeing savings in that $65 million to $70 million range relative to last year, again, given pro forma affects the roll-in mergers. Now moving to the CFO Commentary document we posted on our investor website. On Page 2, most of the items are consistent with what we provided to you during our September Investor Day. Then on Page 3, in total, the Corporate segment came in about $0.02 better than the midpoint of our September estimate. The interest and banking line, about $0.01 favorable, the acquisition cost line also slightly favorable. The corporate adjusted line, that\u2019s in line with our September midpoint, and you\u2019ll also see we have a small adjustment for a onetime tax expense related to Brexit. We described that a little bit more in Footnote 6 on that same page. Then in terms of clean energy, third quarter came in a bit better, and you\u2019ll also see our fourth quarter estimate is also a bit better. Then on Page 4, you\u2019ll see that we provided our first look at our 2021 estimates based on the preliminary forecasting from our utility partners. It looks like 2021 could be a lot like we\u2019re seeing here this year. And then when you get back to Page 14 of the earnings release, you\u2019ll see that we have about $1 billion of credit carryforwards on our balance sheet at September 30. Remember, those credits are fully earned. And while we are using some currently, the big return comes between 2022 and, say, 2028, when we will use those credits and thereby harvest about $150 million to $200 million of annual cash. Sure, book or GAAP earnings of $60 million to $65 million will go away in 2022, but instead, we\u2019ll have that $150 million to $200 million of cash earnings in those years. As for M&A, you heard Pat say, we have a really strong pipeline. I think there could be a flurry of activity between now and year-end, given what could happen with taxes. So we\u2019re really well positioned for that. We have more than $1.6 billion of liquidity, consisting of available cash on hand of nearly $550 million and more than $1 billion of borrowing power on our revolving credit facility. Okay. Those are my comments. Thanks to the team for another great quarter. I think we are well positioned to pull off a terrific 2020. Back to you, Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Doug. And operator, I think we\u2019re ready for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The call is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nPhil Stefano: Yes, thanks. So I\u2019ll start with a quick numbers question. The timing impact of the large life pension fund product. Did that have any margin bump to it in the quarter or any onetime impact there?\nDoug Howell: No more or less than any of our other business. That was in that $30 million. We had $50 million of organic growth. It included the onetime or the sale that we have there. And if you assume about 60 points of margin on that business, you get about $30 million. So no more or less than what the other business has.\nPhil Stefano: Okay, got it. And so, Pat, I think it was in your initial comments you made the remark that next year organic should be better than we\u2019re seeing this year play out. And I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the extent to which stimulus plays a role in that and how government support might be a moving mechanism or at least how you felt that impacted you through 2020 to use as a \u2013 for us to contemplate in 2021?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I think for sure, in 2020, in terms of a pressure release for our clients, as we got into the summer, it was huge. I mean it just \u2013 it made a huge difference in terms of giving businesses an ability to keep their employees and to keep their businesses going. And quite honestly, to pay their insurance bills. So I do hope and do believe that stimulus will be brought about in the new year. And I think that, again, will be viewed as a very strong positive for the economy and for our individual businesses. I can\u2019t put a specific number on that, Phil. But anything that keeps the economy chugging along, as you well know, our entire business is predicated on exposure units.\nPhil Stefano: Yes. Okay. And the last one I got for you, and it\u2019s an unfair question, so I apologize. But we are getting a lot of questions from our end about the concept of brokerage margin expansion and the extent to which expectations should be up, flat or down for next year. And I mean, it\u2019s something of a crystal ball question, depending on how the economy unfolds and such, but I know that this question is something that\u2019s important to investors\u2019 minds. So if you have any thoughts about how we should contemplate this, it would be appreciated.\nDoug Howell: All right. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an unfair question or not, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s an easy answer. So let me see if I can help you with that. Let\u2019s take a couple of things that we know. First, as I said in my prepared remarks, we should be able to hold most of the expense savings that we\u2019re seeing here in the third quarter when we hit our fourth quarter \u2013 in our fourth quarter right now. Then the next question is, let\u2019s go out one more quarter, let\u2019s say, to first quarter 2021. Absent a miracle, I just don\u2019t see that quarter much different than what we\u2019re seeing here in the fourth quarter. So let\u2019s say that we can hold $60 million to $70 million of that, the savings that we\u2019re seeing now. Let\u2019s invest. Now you\u2019ve got to jump way out to 2022. So let\u2019s just go to 2022. I think that we\u2019re turning the pandemic adversity into a real advantage for Gallagher. We\u2019ve learned a lot in the short period about our business and how our clients are operating, so over the next 15 months, we believe a good portion of those savings that we\u2019re seeing now could become permanent. So let\u2019s call that half or $30 million. So that leaves really what happens in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021 to fill in. The answer to that, I believe, kind of lies somewhere in between. I should have a better answer when we get to our December IR Day, but we\u2019ll stick to the $60 million to $70 million or $65 million to $70 million, we\u2019ll figure that out here over the next six weeks and have a better answer for you in December. Regardless, if you get out to 2022, we believe there could be over $100 million of savings, annualized savings, that we might not have realized by 2022 had there not been a pandemic. So it has pulled together our efforts to relook at our business and change some of the ways that we operate. So there will be permanent savings there relative to where we would have gotten on our own, let\u2019s say, without a pandemic, by 2022. How that actually emerges in 2021? I\u2019ll have a better idea as we go through our budget and planning process over the next six weeks. So I hope that helps, it gets you a part way. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a complete answer, but that\u2019s what we know right now.\nPhil Stefano: That\u2019s better than I hoped for. Thank you. It\u2019s perfect.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Phil.\nOperator: Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening. My first question, I guess, kind of picking up on that margin question. So that kind of helps us think through the expenses, but then the second portion, is that, Pat alluded to, organic revenue growth in 2021, he feels like should be better than 2020, right, which you guys essentially end up at around 3%? And so this quarter, right you saw about 150 basis points of margin improvement off of your organic revenue growth. So how do we think of that component of the margin, right? So you\u2019re growing organically over 3% next year, what\u2019s the component of underlying margin improvement that we should think about adding on to whatever expenses can be utilized?\nDoug Howell: I think that you\u2019ll see \u2013 if we hit 3% of organic growth next year, absent all these savings, there\u2019s a 0.5 point to 3.25 point of margin expansion in that 3% number next year. If it\u2019s 4%, maybe we get back closer to a full point, which isn\u2019t all that dissimilar to what we are running pre-pandemic. Now if you draw a line between 2017, we are marching up in margin every year. And you draw that line out to 2022, whatever you would have gotten in 2022, add another $100 million, $120 million of savings to that, and you\u2019ll get pretty close to where we think the margin would be in 2022. So our March forward hasn\u2019t changed on the base organic piece.\nElyse Greenspan: Was there anything though then that was one-off that you saw 150 basis points this quarter? I mean, obviously, there could be quarterly seasonality on, I guess, 4% organic growth or 3% ex the onetime item?\nDoug Howell: Well, I think when we\u2019re at 4.2% organic this quarter, I think you did \u2013 we would see over 1 point of margin expansion. That\u2019s probably not out of whack for other quarters in the past where it\u2019s 4.2%, but nothing that really pops out at me. We did have some headcount savings in there. Our hiring hasn\u2019t been as robust as it has in the past. Raises have been deferred a little bit though. That might influence a little bit, but there\u2019s nothing onetime in there that I would point to.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then a couple of questions on M&A. The first one, I believe at your last IR Day was alluded to some \u2013 like modestly larger deals, I want to say in the $25 million range, that you thought could come to fruition. By looking at the activity this quarter, that hasn\u2019t happened. So are those some of the deals, I guess, that you guys alluded to that maybe could come to fruition in the fourth quarter as deals get done in advance of potential track changes?\nDoug Howell: That\u2019s right. There are two nice $25 million revenue acquisitions that were nearly done with due diligence on. We\u2019ve had Board approval on it, and we hope to get them wrapped up between now and the end of the year.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then my last question. So as we think about larger M&A, it\u2019s been a few years, like Gallagher expanded internationally, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the UK. And so if you guys are going to consider another larger transaction, Doug, you alluded to the debt capacity as well as cash that you have, if there is a sizable deal in the market that perhaps you chose to use more of your equity than you have in the recent times, would there be certain metrics, be it revenue, earnings accretion or something that you guys would be looking to, if it was a more sizable transaction that potentially required the use of your own equity?\nDoug Howell: Yes. We do the traditional review of that to make sure that it wasn\u2019t dilutive that there were synergies that could take out of it. But really, to be honest, Elyse, we like our tuck-in merger strategy. This is our opportunity to pick every single one that wants to join the family. We have that. We have fair multiples on those that we\u2019re paying for them. We integrate much better into one another. We like our small tuck-in strategy at this point, and there\u2019s lots and lots of opportunity for that, so.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I think that\u2019s a key point, Elyse. This is Pat. When you look at the top 100 in business insurance in the United States alone that doesn\u2019t recognize the rest of the world, you still have another 19,000 to 25,000, maybe even 30,000 firms out there that are not in that top 100. And a good portion of those are still owned by baby boomers. So our \u2013 the opportunity to do these tuck-ins is just way, way greater than the large play.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, thank you. I appreciate all the colors. Thanks, guys.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Elyse.\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Peters: Good afternoon. Just a couple of follow-on questions. If you were pointing to, I think, Page 5 or 6 of your press release \u2013 6, where you go through the adjusted EBITDAC margin. And I think through the nine months Doug, you reported a 33.6% EBITDAC margin on an adjusted basis. And I know you\u2019re doing a good job of chronicling how much of the savings are going to \u2013 should extend themselves beyond just the opportunity you\u2019ve had this year. At what point do you hit that threshold where you can\u2019t grow margins because you have to invest in the business? Or put it another way, at some point, you can\u2019t turn this into a 50% margin business or maybe you can, you just haven\u2019t mapped it out for us yet.\nDoug Howell: No, Greg. Listen, trees don\u2019t grow to the moon. I think that there are plateaus when you reach them. I think when you get into that 30% to 32% type range as an annual margin in a brokerage segment across the globe, that\u2019s a pretty fair margin to have. But scale does bring advantages. And this is a \u2013 the brokerage business is showing that size can be helpful, especially with size in the same fairway that you\u2019re playing. If you can get more acquisitions that are right down the middle of the fairway, using the technologies that we\u2019ve developed, using our offshore centers of excellence, our centralization that we\u2019ve worked on for 15 years, we think that there\u2019s still terrific opportunity for us to roll in and have nice, steady margin improvement. If we\u2019re growing over 3% or 4%, well, I think it can be \u2013 you can eke out a little margin just because of scale. And some of it depends on wage inflation, too. I mean we are a people company, and we are lucky that after the Great Recession that wage inflation remained in check. Perhaps here in the pandemic, we\u2019ll keep wage inflation in check a little bit. But we are a people company, so raises are something that we want to give. And so \u2013 but if we can keep wage inflation in check, I think that you can eke out some margins.\nGreg Peters: Just as a follow-up to that comment, when do wage or salary increases typically happen for staff? Is that a beginning of the year event to midyear event? When does that generally hit?\nDoug Howell: Kind of late second quarter, early third quarter. It\u2019s a little bit later this year. We\u2019ll do that here in December.\nGreg Peters: Got it. In the balance sheet, I noticed that the premiums and fees receivable jumped up from year-end. And I\u2019m just curious if you \u2013 if there\u2019s anything in that increase that is troublesome or if that\u2019s expected, on plan, or just some color behind that. Then, the numbers I\u2019m looking at are, on the balance sheet, the 6,702.5 versus the 5,419.2.\nDoug Howell: Yes. Okay. Good question. First of all, we look at our cash receipts every day. We\u2019re not having any slowdown at all from client premium payments coming in, so we don\u2019t have a liquidity issue there. And again, I just looked at the report at 2:00 this afternoon, and our October is equal \u2013 since the pandemic, our cash flows have been equally, if not better, than what they were in pre-pandemic time. So that isn\u2019t it. We do have some \u2013 as we have a reinsurance operation, now you can get some significant reinsurance premiums that flow through that can cause some of that to be a little more volatile on that, but there is nothing there that I would \u2013 that is at all indicative of any type of slowdown in payments by our customers in that.\nGreg Peters: So in other words, DSOs have remained fairly stable this year relative to previous year?\nDoug Howell: Yes. That\u2019s right.\nGreg Peters: Got it. I guess the final question, I know you\u2019ve already provided a lot of commentary around M&A, but I can\u2019t help myself but go back to that well. First of all, Pat, when you\u2019re talking culture, I know it\u2019s very important to you. Are you \u2013 when you\u2019re looking at M&A opportunities, are you willing to consider M&A that has a slower organic growth profile? Or, put it another way, is the deals that you\u2019ve done in the last couple of years, have they boosted your \u2013 have they been a net gain to organic revenue on a consolidated basis? Or has it been neutral or been a headwind? Does that make sense?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, it certainly hasn\u2019t been a headwind. And the nice thing about tuck-ins, Greg, is that if you get the right folks on, sometimes they can be terrifically accretive. But by and large, I think when you add all this, it\u2019s probably right in line with the rest of our organization. And we\u2019re seeing lots of opportunities, but again, you followed us for years. It\u2019s not brain surgery, culture is absolutely critical. And I\u2019d like to sound more sophisticated, we try to find people who care about their people, love this business and run a good business. If they can\u2019t make money for themselves, they\u2019re not going to make money for us and our shareholders. But once they cross that hurdle, it\u2019s really got to be about, are they going to fit culturally and are they going to really be able to take advantage of the things that we bring to the table? And I think you\u2019ve heard me talk about this before. I tell them that when we bring them here to Rolling Meadows or they joined one of our offices out there, we open the curtain and show them the candy store. And they\u2019re like, \"Wow, I\u2019ve got all this to work with now?\" And when that happens, it opens up, in many instances, accounts that are local to them, and we\u2019re very strong in our local communities. We want to help them build that strength and accounts that they never had a chance to touch because of their size are now open to them because really, there\u2019s nothing that we can\u2019t help them tackle. And frankly, that gets them excited. So for us, are they going to stay? Do they love selling insurance, which I know sounds crazy, but there are some of us that were born to do that? And the fact is those people end up being with us a long time, building great businesses having a great time doing it. And it really does come down to cultural fit.\nGreg Peters: Right. Well, I know you\u2019ve described it before. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve used the word \u2013 the phrase candy store with me, but it doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t used it before.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: But you understood what I meant, right, Greg.\nGreg Peters: Absolutely.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: There you go.\nGreg Peters: So the final piece on M&A, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of stuff going around the election, anticipation of maybe a change in tax cuts in the \u2013 tax rates in the U.S., et cetera, that may lead to accelerating deal flow. Are you seeing any activity in Europe? Are you seeing any change in the flow of potential deals outside the U.S.?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes. And I\u2019ll tell you why. It\u2019s exactly what we told you in 14 when we did our transactions in the UK, Australia and Canada, in particular, and now in Europe and Latin America. Once we\u2019ve got a platform that gives people confidence that we\u2019re really there to stay, then the smaller broker has something to look at, that is not just getting a new name or changing where they send their reports, they get the benefit of the fact that we\u2019ve got scale, we\u2019ve got brand recognition and we have capabilities. So yes, our pipeline in the UK, our pipeline in Australia, Latin America, New Zealand and Continental Europe are stronger than they\u2019ve ever been.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thank you for the answers.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: And our next question is from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, great. Maybe we could talk about Risk Management a little bit. I think from the prepared remarks, it sounded like claims counts were \u2013 are continuing to improve, but still down. Maybe you can put some numbers around work comp and GL. Are those still down kind of double digits year-over-year? What are you guys \u2013 any update on the outlook for the Risk Management segment? I mean margins improved more than what you thought, probably. Maybe can you talk why margins improved more than expected as well?\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think the question is what type of claims? I think the more difficult claims that are rising, the kind of the churn business is still down, maybe 20% to 30% on the small, but we don\u2019t make a lot of money off of those anyway, so they\u2019re kind of low margin. So that doesn\u2019t hurt us so much. I think we have had a little bit of boost in settling claims that have risen because of COVID. And so our complicated claims, they\u2019re still there. And so that has helped this business be more resilient. If you think about it, it might be more of a lost revenue story than it is a lost profit story as you can see by the margin. So the advantage we have is that we\u2019ve held on pretty well, being only down 5% this quarter on a revenue basis. As we get a vaccine, as things start to improve, you will have that business come back in and hopefully be up nicely in the positive organic space next year.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Maybe stepping back and thinking about brokerage again, one of your competitors today I think kind of hinted at maybe pricing had reached a point that had reached its limit. At least, there\u2019s definitely some businesses that are experiencing some fairly high double-digit rate increases. And I think that your competitor alluded to maybe the carriers have \u2013 some are getting enough freight and maybe we\u2019re at peak freight. Any thoughts about kind of what you\u2019re hearing and seeing from the carriers? And it feels like there\u2019s some new capital coming into the space as well.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, there\u2019s clearly new capital coming in, and I will tell you that there is zero interest from the people that \u2013 the partners we\u2019re talking to at modifying rate increases at all. I mean they\u2019re not getting any rate of return on new invested dollars. Social inflation is killing them. Lines of coverage that have been under attack for years while the market stayed soft are raising their \u2013 continuing to raise their head. This is \u2013 I see nothing in the way of softening or stopping the momentum. Now remember, again, we tried to give you some detail in our prepared remarks, workers\u2019 compensation is about flat. They make good money on workers\u2019 comp. Workers\u2019 comp is competitive in the United States, and our clients benefit from that. And remember, our job is to make sure we do everything we can for our clients to make sure the hard market doesn\u2019t cripple. So it\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting here and saying, \"Hey, this is \u2013 it\u2019s getting harder by the minute.\" But I can tell you, when you talk to the people that are the actual providers of capital, they\u2019re not seeing light at the end of the tunnel being yahoo we\u2019re back to soften, that\u2019s for sure.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Great. And just lastly, just making sure, there\u2019s nothing supplementals and contingents that was unusual this quarter?\nDoug Howell: No. No. Not this quarter. Not this year at all, as a matter of fact.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you very much.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is with Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Shanker: Yes. Good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my call.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Josh.\nJosh Shanker: So I was curious, historically, I guess, for a number of years, we\u2019ve been in a middling market, and I think that benefits brokers who have a lot of visibility on pricing and maybe it disadvantages carriers and the negotiation with the client. As things are perhaps changing, is there any benefit being given to the carriers in that negotiation, where the client demand or you\u2019ve encouraged some more competitive fee structure from the broker? Is there any renegotiation going on at that level?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Fees are one of the things that always happen. And this is \u2013 since 2006, in the United States, in particular, we\u2019ve been completely transparent with our clients on what we make. And we are not feeling huge pressure on the income that we make for the extra work that we\u2019re doing today. And that\u2019s another reason when you look at fees and what have you, that even if rates were up 25%, you\u2019re not going to see our revenue jump 25%. That wouldn\u2019t be a fair transaction. But at the same time, there\u2019s a lot more work, and it\u2019s our expertise now that we\u2019re selling that sells a lot better in a hard market than it does a soft market. If it\u2019s in a soft market, the person down the street that hangs a shingle out can get you five quotes. We\u2019re not getting five quotes today. And you better work hard with somebody who\u2019s got some real dedicated inside clear understanding of your business that can differentiate your risk and your approach to risk to that underwriting community or you\u2019re going to get whacked. And so our services are more valuable than ever. And you\u2019re right, we went for about 10 years. And you\u2019ll recall in my conversations on these conference calls, I always alluded to the fact that I don\u2019t like hard markets. And everybody would say were \u2013 and when the rates were up 1%, down 2%, up 3%, sideways, flat, that was perfect for clients. It gave them a chance to choose. It gave us a chance to be able to say this market or that one put them together this way, build the tower this way, and it was really another way to show our expertise. Now this is a time where we\u2019ve got to give good counsel, and they\u2019ve got to understand that in many respects, it\u2019s a seller\u2019s market. And we\u2019ll get them through it. No, it won\u2019t last forever, but now is the time to make sure you\u2019re partnering with someone that knows what they\u2019re doing. And we\u2019re getting paid.\nJosh Shanker: That\u2019s very clear. And then on Gallagher Bassett, can you talk about throughput of workers\u2019 comp claims and what the marketplace is shaping up to be with lower employment or with a work at home and how that changes the services you provide there?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, the services we provide there, Josh, they\u2019re not different in the sense that if you have a workers\u2019 comp claim, we\u2019re going to handle it. There\u2019s all kinds of protocols, state by state, rules, regulations, et cetera. There are fewer claims when you\u2019re not in the office, you\u2019re not in the factory, you\u2019re working from home. There are clearly fewer claims and fewer accidents. And when economic activity regains itself and people come back to the places of work, we expect that those claims will reflect that. But in terms of how you deal with someone that gets hurt, it\u2019s \u2013 we still have to file those state rules, and we still have to adjust and adjudicate the claim, which we think, if you use Gallagher Bassett, will give you a better outcome.\nJosh Shanker: And in terms of flow of claims incidences?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I\u2019m sorry, you broke up, Josh, what was that?\nJosh Shanker: Claims incidents during the pandemic, how is that shaping up?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Incidents are down, significantly down. That\u2019s the whole reason \u2013 when we talk about claim counts, that\u2019s incidents.\nJosh Shanker: Yes. Yes. And so does that change the service or the fees? They say, well, look, we don\u2019t \u2013 in terms of your interaction with the clients for Gallagher Bassett, does that change what you can charge or change the negotiation at all? Or is it a typically a fee for service?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No. No. No. It doesn\u2019t at all.\nJosh Shanker: Okay, great. Thanks, Josh.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nYaron Kinar: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. A few timing questions, if I could. One, you\u2019re talking about M&A maybe being a little bit \u2013 is the pipeline being robust here as we head into 2021 because of the potential tax impact there? Do you think that could mean that there\u2019s a bit of a lull in M&A as we enter 2021?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I don\u2019t think so. I mean, when I look at it, it really is a very interesting market, which is why you see, it was not that long ago that there were very few billion-dollar brokers. Today, there\u2019s about 11 or 12 of us. By that, I mean revenue. That\u2019s why private equity has been so prevalent in the business, which is good for us because private equity is smart money telling the investment community, we\u2019re a great bet. But the fact is, there are thousands and thousands of independent agents and brokers that ultimately have a chance to capitalize their life\u2019s work, and I think that\u2019s not going to stop.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then could you remind us when in 2021 do the 2011 clean coal plant sunset \u2013 does the tax credit sunset?\nDoug Howell: Okay, there\u2019s two answers to that. Our plants that we operate will sunset mostly in late November, early December, absent an extension. For those plants that we don\u2019t operate at our Chem Mod affiliate that we own a substantial piece of that gets a royalty of, those could stop production sometime more in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter. It just depends on \u2013 it\u2019s 10 years from the date that they were placed in service. So if they were placed in service before December of 2011, then they would be \u2013 they would sunset a little bit earlier. So that\u2019s why on Page 5 of the CFO Commentary, you\u2019ll see that our royalty income is just \u2013 we\u2019re forecasting that just to be down a little bit relative to 2020 because some of those will sunset just a little bit earlier.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. Okay. And those last couple of months of the year don\u2019t tend to be very large months from a clean coal perspective, right?\nDoug Howell: It can be. If you get a cold December, you can \u2013 the southern plants that are dependent on baseboard heat, electric heat, would be. And again, I can\u2019t miss the opportunity to reinforce, just because $60 million to $70 million of GAAP earnings go away, that\u2019s \u2013 right away, we\u2019ll flip in 2022 into harvesting all the credits that we\u2019ve been generating over the last 10 years. So that\u2019s \u2013 you might almost double the amount of earnings on a cash basis versus then on a GAAP basis at that time.\nYaron Kinar: Right. And then final timing question. The contract that you\u2019ve pulled forward into the third quarter in Brokerage, does that get renewed in the third quarter of next year?\nDoug Howell: Well, first of all, I wouldn\u2019t say we pulled it forward. They just got it closed sooner. So that was a great work by the guys that have been working on that product for a lot. That\u2019s going to be an occasional sale. I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s something that would repeat year in and year out. It would be another customer that would happen to see the real smarts in this product and decide to close it in third quarter next year. But that would be hitting us. It\u2019s a little bit more elephant hunting on that, so call it that \u2013 if you close one every 18 months, that would be great, but who knows. It\u2019s a terrific product that\u2019s getting some momentum. So we might see it a little bit more frequently, but I\u2019d be happy with one of those every 18 months.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. Thank you.\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Yaron.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Tunis: Hey, thanks. Good evening. I just had one. So employee benefits, I might have missed this, Pat, but I thought you said it was plus 6%, but that included the one-off transaction.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: That\u2019s right.\nRyan Tunis: What was the organic, excluding that within the employee benefits unit?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hold on.\nDoug Howell: Flat to 2%. I mean, so let\u2019s call it 1.3%, if I look at my notes.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then just looking for an update, obviously, that is a business that economically impacted at a lot of the other brokers. We\u2019ve had three quarters \u2013 kind of three quarters in the recession. Are you learning anything new that would change your organic outlook for employee benefits? Or is it still kind of the same story you\u2019ve been talking about in previous quarters at the mid-quarter updates?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I think the thing that\u2019s probably most beneficial to our business that we learned. And first of all, thanks for the question, Ryan. When we look at the business in general and say, what have we learned over the last seven, eight months about what can happen, how this business can be run, where people can do it? How expertise can be exported around the world? I mean, we\u2019ve got experts in verticals that are world-class. And you want to try to get them to a prospect or a client, you can use up a whole day or two days of travel. Today, they can drop in by video call and bam, they\u2019re there and people accept that. So we\u2019ve learned a lot, and there\u2019s lots of opportunities for our business because of that. But I think probably the thing that reemphasizes why we\u2019re so high on the benefits businesses, even in this pandemic and even with the recession that hit, the amount of employees that stay employed, the employers holding on to their people, it\u2019s incredible. I mean we thought in March and April, get ready, the floor is going to drop out, everybody is going to let everybody go. And of course, I\u2019m being facetious. But the fact is, this war for talent, ongoing long term, what\u2019s your product? I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re making big steel drums, you\u2019re a people business. And people are holding on to their folks and our censuses by count have not dropped through the floor. And people are saying \u2013 and as we come out of this, to me, it just makes that business even better, which demands incredible expertise to balance all the costs and all the covers and to make sure that you are, in fact, providing what the employees need, but that you also make sure through communication that they understand that they\u2019re better off with you. So it\u2019s \u2013 basically, it\u2019s really put us in a spot to want to double down on that business.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. Understood, thanks.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: And our last question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: Great. Thanks. Just a small question. I just \u2013 I feel like I missed the amount of the employee benefits contract that was signed earlier than expected. Have you given quantification on the actual revenue?\nDoug Howell: No, we really haven\u2019t. I think you can probably do the math. It was about $12 million to $15 million, so\u2026\nMeyer Shields: Okay. I can do the math now.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks for making it easy, teacher.\nMeyer Shields: The second question, I know there\u2019s been sort of a long-term strategy at Gallagher of moving clients along to self-insurance over time. Has the pandemic interrupted that at all?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No. I mean, in fact, if anything, it\u2019s made it more of a crucial conversation because it\u2019s crunching businesses. And when the economy is good and employees are being hired and there\u2019s fight over employees over \u2013 because of a full employment, those times are heady times for many, many people. And yes, financially, we can always point out to those businesses why considering a large self-insured retention, bringing Gallagher Bassett in, getting better outcomes on your claims, makes for better control of not only your insurance purchase, but your entire risk management program, and we do a good job of selling that. You put a buyer against the wall, they\u2019re all ears, and we\u2019re really good at moving people first dollar cover into a form of risk management, risk retention, group captives, et cetera. That is our \u2013 that\u2019s our heritage.\nDoug Howell: Typically, when you have increasing pricing, an account that customer that had really good loss experience is more willing to look to build self as a component of their program being through self insurance. And as prices go up, that gets their attention. And we do a lot of workers\u2019 comp in this, and workers\u2019 comp has had rate cuts recently. It\u2019s flat right now. I think that if workers\u2019 comp goes hard, I think you\u2019ll see considerably more folks with good experience or companies wanting to look at alternative risk transfer.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well Doug hit on something, Meyer, I think this has been the dilemma that really wasn\u2019t talked about during that eight to ten-year period where the market was relatively soft or was flat. When the market starts to firm, one of the dilemmas for the insurance carriers is they need the entire base to give then more rate. The better units of risk look to move out of that buying community. And so now you\u2019re taking from the insuring community their better units of risk, leaving them to fight over what is maybe not the best units and even needing more rate. And that is when the competition thins because there just aren\u2019t thousands of people that can do what we do.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. No, that makes perfect sense. And that was very helpful. Final question, and I may have just been modeling this incorrectly. But the investment income in the brokerage, the investment income and net gains on divestitures ticked up something like $3 million from the second quarter to the third quarter. Should we expect that sort of seasonality? Or is that just random now?\nDoug Howell: All right. So there\u2019s two questions there. What happened with investment income, right, what you\u2019re saying?\nMeyer Shields: Yes.\nDoug Howell: Well, listen, first, some of that \u2013 some of the numbers running through there has to do with our premium finance business down in Australia and New Zealand. But let me give you the punch line on it because we are down somewhat in investment income, just in true investment income that is \u2013 that we earn on the premium trust accounts, et cetera, we are down probably in the third quarter somewhere around $4 million, $3.5 million from where we were last year. So you wouldn\u2019t be seeing that right.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Meyer.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now return the call back over to Pat for any closing remarks.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you very much. Let me give you just a quick comment. Again, thanks, everybody, for joining us this afternoon. We delivered an excellent quarter in first nine months of the year in the face of a difficult economic environment. And again, I\u2019d like to thank our 32,000-plus Gallagher professionals for their relentless efforts and dedication. I remain confident that we can deliver another outstanding year of financial performance and successfully navigate these challenging times. Thank you, again, for being with us. We really appreciate it.\nOperator: And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you, and have a good day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Doug Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Like Pat said, another excellent quarter. I, too, would like to extend my appreciation to all of our Gallagher colleagues around the globe, what a remarkable job you are doing in these challenging times, servicing our clients, generating new business, all the while executing our cost control playbook. Today, I'll begin with some comments on organic and the interplay with our cost saving. That seemed to get a lot of questions during our July earnings call and again during our September Investor Day call, so I'll spend a little more time on that today. I will then provide a few observations from our CFO Commentary document and finish with some thoughts on M&A, cash and liquidity. So all right, let's go to the earnings release, Page 4, to the brokerage organic table. Now as Pat said, a great quarter with 4.2% all in organic, which equates to about $50 million of organic growth. Then, when you turn to Page 6 to the brokerage EBITDAC table, you see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by $105 million this quarter. So how do we deliver that $105 million on $50 million of organic? First, about $13 million of EBITDAC came from M&A, net of divestitures. Next, a bit over $30 million came from that $50 million of organic. So that means we saved about $60 million from our cost control playbook. From a margin perspective, all in, we grew adjusted EBITDAC margin about 630 basis points. And then when you do the math, you'll see that even without the additional expense savings, we expanded margin about 150 basis points, which is impressive in and by itself. In the Risk Management segment, a little easier to compute. Revenues were backwards about $10 million, but EBITDAC grew about $1 million, so cost savings were about $11 million. Combine both segments, you get about $70 million of cost savings, which is at the top end of our estimates provided during our September IR Day and close to what we saved in the second quarter. Let me give you a breakdown of these savings: reduced travel, entertainment and advertising, down about $26 million; reduced consulting and professional fees, down $15 million; reduced outside labor and other workforce actions, $14 million; reduced office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs, about $11 million; and reduced employee benefit and medical plan costs about $4 million. Now when I look towards the fourth quarter, we're starting to see a slight increase in our producers traveling more to see clients and prospects. We are executing on some targeted marketing and advertising programs and our medical plan utilization continues to return to pre-pandemic levels. But even with that, we're still seeing savings in that $65 million to $70 million range relative to last year, again, given pro forma affects the roll-in mergers. Now moving to the CFO Commentary document we posted on our investor website. On Page 2, most of the items are consistent with what we provided to you during our September Investor Day. Then on Page 3, in total, the Corporate segment came in about $0.02 better than the midpoint of our September estimate. The interest and banking line, about $0.01 favorable, the acquisition cost line also slightly favorable. The corporate adjusted line, that's in line with our September midpoint, and you'll also see we have a small adjustment for a onetime tax expense related to Brexit. We described that a little bit more in Footnote 6 on that same page. Then in terms of clean energy, third quarter came in a bit better, and you'll also see our fourth quarter estimate is also a bit better. Then on Page 4, you'll see that we provided our first look at our 2021 estimates based on the preliminary forecasting from our utility partners. It looks like 2021 could be a lot like we're seeing here this year. And then when you get back to Page 14 of the earnings release, you'll see that we have about $1 billion of credit carryforwards on our balance sheet at September 30. Remember, those credits are fully earned. And while we are using some currently, the big return comes between 2022 and, say, 2028, when we will use those credits and thereby harvest about $150 million to $200 million of annual cash. Sure, book or GAAP earnings of $60 million to $65 million will go away in 2022, but instead, we'll have that $150 million to $200 million of cash earnings in those years. As for M&A, you heard Pat say, we have a really strong pipeline. I think there could be a flurry of activity between now and year-end, given what could happen with taxes. So we're really well positioned for that. We have more than $1.6 billion of liquidity, consisting of available cash on hand of nearly $550 million and more than $1 billion of borrowing power on our revolving credit facility. Okay. Those are my comments. Thanks to the team for another great quarter. I think we are well positioned to pull off a terrific 2020. Back to you, Pat. No more or less than any of our other business. That was in that $30 million. We had $50 million of organic growth. It included the onetime or the sale that we have there. And if you assume about 60 points of margin on that business, you get about $30 million. So no more or less than what the other business has. All right. I don't know if it's an unfair question or not, but I don't know if it's an easy answer. So let me see if I can help you with that. Let's take a couple of things that we know. First, as I said in my prepared remarks, we should be able to hold most of the expense savings that we're seeing here in the third quarter when we hit our fourth quarter \u2013 in our fourth quarter right now. Then the next question is, let's go out one more quarter, let's say, to first quarter 2021. Absent a miracle, I just don't see that quarter much different than what we're seeing here in the fourth quarter. So let's say that we can hold $60 million to $70 million of that, the savings that we're seeing now. Let's invest. Now you've got to jump way out to 2022. So let's just go to 2022. I think that we're turning the pandemic adversity into a real advantage for Gallagher. We've learned a lot in the short period about our business and how our clients are operating, so over the next 15 months, we believe a good portion of those savings that we're seeing now could become permanent. So let's call that half or $30 million. So that leaves really what happens in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021 to fill in. The answer to that, I believe, kind of lies somewhere in between. I should have a better answer when we get to our December IR Day, but we'll stick to the $60 million to $70 million or $65 million to $70 million, we'll figure that out here over the next six weeks and have a better answer for you in December. Regardless, if you get out to 2022, we believe there could be over $100 million of savings, annualized savings, that we might not have realized by 2022 had there not been a pandemic. So it has pulled together our efforts to relook at our business and change some of the ways that we operate. So there will be permanent savings there relative to where we would have gotten on our own, let's say, without a pandemic, by 2022. How that actually emerges in 2021? I'll have a better idea as we go through our budget and planning process over the next six weeks. So I hope that helps, it gets you a part way. I don't know if it's a complete answer, but that's what we know right now. I think that you'll see \u2013 if we hit 3% of organic growth next year, absent all these savings, there's a 0.5 point to 3.25 point of margin expansion in that 3% number next year. If it's 4%, maybe we get back closer to a full point, which isn't all that dissimilar to what we are running pre-pandemic. Now if you draw a line between 2017, we are marching up in margin every year. And you draw that line out to 2022, whatever you would have gotten in 2022, add another $100 million, $120 million of savings to that, and you'll get pretty close to where we think the margin would be in 2022. So our March forward hasn't changed on the base organic piece. Well, I think when we're at 4.2% organic this quarter, I think you did \u2013 we would see over 1 point of margin expansion. That's probably not out of whack for other quarters in the past where it's 4.2%, but nothing that really pops out at me. We did have some headcount savings in there. Our hiring hasn't been as robust as it has in the past. Raises have been deferred a little bit though. That might influence a little bit, but there's nothing onetime in there that I would point to. That's right. There are two nice $25 million revenue acquisitions that were nearly done with due diligence on. We've had Board approval on it, and we hope to get them wrapped up between now and the end of the year. Yes. We do the traditional review of that to make sure that it wasn't dilutive that there were synergies that could take out of it. But really, to be honest, Elyse, we like our tuck-in merger strategy. This is our opportunity to pick every single one that wants to join the family. We have that. We have fair multiples on those that we're paying for them. We integrate much better into one another. We like our small tuck-in strategy at this point, and there's lots and lots of opportunity for that, so. Thanks, Elyse. No, Greg. Listen, trees don't grow to the moon. I think that there are plateaus when you reach them. I think when you get into that 30% to 32% type range as an annual margin in a brokerage segment across the globe, that's a pretty fair margin to have. But scale does bring advantages. And this is a \u2013 the brokerage business is showing that size can be helpful, especially with size in the same fairway that you're playing. If you can get more acquisitions that are right down the middle of the fairway, using the technologies that we've developed, using our offshore centers of excellence, our centralization that we've worked on for 15 years, we think that there's still terrific opportunity for us to roll in and have nice, steady margin improvement. If we're growing over 3% or 4%, well, I think it can be \u2013 you can eke out a little margin just because of scale. And some of it depends on wage inflation, too. I mean we are a people company, and we are lucky that after the Great Recession that wage inflation remained in check. Perhaps here in the pandemic, we'll keep wage inflation in check a little bit. But we are a people company, so raises are something that we want to give. And so \u2013 but if we can keep wage inflation in check, I think that you can eke out some margins. Kind of late second quarter, early third quarter. It's a little bit later this year. We'll do that here in December. Yes. Okay. Good question. First of all, we look at our cash receipts every day. We're not having any slowdown at all from client premium payments coming in, so we don't have a liquidity issue there. And again, I just looked at the report at 2:00 this afternoon, and our October is equal \u2013 since the pandemic, our cash flows have been equally, if not better, than what they were in pre-pandemic time. So that isn't it. We do have some \u2013 as we have a reinsurance operation, now you can get some significant reinsurance premiums that flow through that can cause some of that to be a little more volatile on that, but there is nothing there that I would \u2013 that is at all indicative of any type of slowdown in payments by our customers in that. Yes. That's right. Yes. I think the question is what type of claims? I think the more difficult claims that are rising, the kind of the churn business is still down, maybe 20% to 30% on the small, but we don't make a lot of money off of those anyway, so they're kind of low margin. So that doesn't hurt us so much. I think we have had a little bit of boost in settling claims that have risen because of COVID. And so our complicated claims, they're still there. And so that has helped this business be more resilient. If you think about it, it might be more of a lost revenue story than it is a lost profit story as you can see by the margin. So the advantage we have is that we've held on pretty well, being only down 5% this quarter on a revenue basis. As we get a vaccine, as things start to improve, you will have that business come back in and hopefully be up nicely in the positive organic space next year. No. No. Not this quarter. Not this year at all, as a matter of fact. Okay, there's two answers to that. Our plants that we operate will sunset mostly in late November, early December, absent an extension. For those plants that we don't operate at our Chem Mod affiliate that we own a substantial piece of that gets a royalty of, those could stop production sometime more in the late third quarter or early fourth quarter. It just depends on \u2013 it's 10 years from the date that they were placed in service. So if they were placed in service before December of 2011, then they would be \u2013 they would sunset a little bit earlier. So that's why on Page 5 of the CFO Commentary, you'll see that our royalty income is just \u2013 we're forecasting that just to be down a little bit relative to 2020 because some of those will sunset just a little bit earlier. It can be. If you get a cold December, you can \u2013 the southern plants that are dependent on baseboard heat, electric heat, would be. And again, I can't miss the opportunity to reinforce, just because $60 million to $70 million of GAAP earnings go away, that's \u2013 right away, we'll flip in 2022 into harvesting all the credits that we've been generating over the last 10 years. So that's \u2013 you might almost double the amount of earnings on a cash basis versus then on a GAAP basis at that time. Well, first of all, I wouldn't say we pulled it forward. They just got it closed sooner. So that was a great work by the guys that have been working on that product for a lot. That's going to be an occasional sale. I don't think that it's something that would repeat year in and year out. It would be another customer that would happen to see the real smarts in this product and decide to close it in third quarter next year. But that would be hitting us. It's a little bit more elephant hunting on that, so call it that \u2013 if you close one every 18 months, that would be great, but who knows. It's a terrific product that's getting some momentum. So we might see it a little bit more frequently, but I'd be happy with one of those every 18 months. Thanks, Yaron. Flat to 2%. I mean, so let's call it 1.3%, if I look at my notes. No, we really haven't. I think you can probably do the math. It was about $12 million to $15 million, so... Typically, when you have increasing pricing, an account that customer that had really good loss experience is more willing to look to build self as a component of their program being through self insurance. And as prices go up, that gets their attention. And we do a lot of workers' comp in this, and workers' comp has had rate cuts recently. It's flat right now. I think that if workers' comp goes hard, I think you'll see considerably more folks with good experience or companies wanting to look at alternative risk transfer. All right. So there's two questions there. What happened with investment income, right, what you're saying? Well, listen, first, some of that \u2013 some of the numbers running through there has to do with our premium finance business down in Australia and New Zealand. But let me give you the punch line on it because we are down somewhat in investment income, just in true investment income that is \u2013 that we earn on the premium trust accounts, et cetera, we are down probably in the third quarter somewhere around $4 million, $3.5 million from where we were last year. So you wouldn't be seeing that right. Thanks, Meyer."

            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings call. Also on the call today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We delivered a very strong third quarter. Despite the current global health crisis and the related economic slowdown resulting from COVID-19, our teams continue to execute at the highest levels. While we continue to place health and safety first, we are selling new business, we are servicing and retaining our clients, we continue to look at merger and acquisition opportunities and our bedrock culture keeps us working together even while physically apart. These are times when our global capabilities, niche expertise and product specialists support our local professionals as they help our customers navigate these challenging times. I'd like to thank our 30,000-plus Gallagher professionals for their efforts and relentless focus on delivering the very best Insurance Brokerage, Consulting and Risk Management services our customers. That is the Gallagher way. Moving to our third quarter financial performance. We grew our combined Brokerage and Risk Management revenues in the third quarter organically and through mergers and acquisitions, and together with our expense control efforts, delivered excellent growth in EBITDAC and net earnings. These results demonstrate our operating flexibility, which has enabled us to quickly adjust our expense base, optimize our workforce, improve our productivity while also raising our quality. Let me break down our results further, starting with our brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was a positive 8.3%. Of that, more than half or 4.2% was organic revenue growth. We did have some favorable timing, I'll discuss that more in a minute. Net earnings margin was up 334 basis points, and adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 632 basis points to 33.4%. Net earnings up 37% and adjusted EBITDAC up 32%, so another excellent quarter during a global pandemic, a fantastic job by the team. Let me walk you around the world and give you some sound bites about each of our brokerage units, and I'll start with our P/C operations. In U.S. retail, another strong quarter with organic growth of about 4%. We saw solid new business and slightly better retention versus last year's third quarter. Rate increases are more than offsetting exposure unit declines, midterm policy modifications, including full policy cancellations, are similar to prior year levels. And our U.S. wholesale operations, risk placement services, organic was 8% and our open brokerage business even better than that, while our MGA program binding businesses returned to positive organic in the quarter. Hereto, rate increases are more than offsetting exposure unit declines. Moving to the UK. Around 2% base organic with stronger growth in our London specialty business due to firmer pricing. In Australia and New Zealand combined, also around 2% organic, with New Zealand slightly stronger than Australia. New business is down a touch in Australia and up in New Zealand. Rate increases there remain positive, but not enough to offset exposure decline. And finally, our Canadian retail operations posted organic of 8%, another terrific new business quarter and stable client retention. So overall, our global P/C operations reported about 4% organic in the quarter, again, an excellent result in a difficult environment and on the higher end of our mid-September expectations. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business, third quarter organic was positive 6%. This includes a large life insurance pension funding product sale that we expected to close in the fourth quarter. Otherwise, new consulting and special project work remains soft, while covered lives under employer-sponsored health plans continue to be more resilient than headline unemployment numbers. So when I bring P/C and benefits together, organic of 4.2% and even allowing for the big benefits win, a great quarter. Looking forward to our fourth quarter. First, recall we had a terrific fourth quarter last year, 6% plus organic, so we're starting off with a tough compare. Second, I just discussed some favorable timing here in the third quarter, so I don't see us hitting 4% again. But thus far in October, P/C retentions, new business, full policy cancellations and other midterm policy adjustments are in line to slightly better than the third quarter, so perhaps we can read nicely in the 2% to 3% range. That would deliver a full year 2020 around 3% organic, which will be a great year in this environment. While there is still a lot of economic and governmental uncertainty which makes forecasting organic a challenge, we can control what we spend. We've demonstrated over the last seven months that we can execute on our cost containment playbook that makes us highly confident we can deliver another quarter and full year of really strong EBITDAC growth. Now let me give you an update on the P/C rate environment. Rate again continued to move higher around the globe during the third quarter. Globally, caught up nearly 7% with tighter terms and conditions and increasingly restrained capacity. By geography, Canada has seen the greatest rate increases, up more than 9%; the U.S. is up about 8%; followed by the UK, including London specialty at about 6%; and Australia and New Zealand, around 3%. By line of business, property remains the strongest, up 12%; next is professional liability, up over 10%; other casualty lines are up 5% to 10%, with umbrella rate increases at least twice that level; and workers' compensation is flat. So while P/C rates are moving higher, the total amount of premium increases our clients are paying are more modest. This is a result of reduced exposure units, higher deductibles, lower limits and clients opting out of coverages. Looking forward, October results are already indicating continued increases during the fourth quarter, and the carriers in the face of catastrophe, the pandemic, rising casualty loss cost, low investment returns, are making a case for firm rates to persist. But remember, that's where we excel. Our job is to make sure our clients get a well-structured insurance program at a fair price. Regardless, it is certainly a more difficult market today than last quarter, and we are seeing some pockets of a hard market in certain lines and geographies. I see that continuing into 2021, next year, organic should be better than we are seeing this year play out. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We completed five brokerage mergers during the third quarter at fair multiples. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our M&A pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $350 million of annualized revenues, and our pipeline continues to grow. Difficult market conditions in the pandemic are further highlighting the need for expertise and data-driven tools. Our platform is an excellent fit for entrepreneurs looking to support their current clients, use our tools and data to grow their businesses and advance their employees' careers. Right now, it feels like it will be a more active finish to the year as merger prospects have concerns over possible 2021 tax change. Next, I'd like to move to our risk management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic revenue at minus 5.3% was a bit better than what we said at our September IR day. This is a really nice sequential improvement from second quarter organic being down nearly 10%. And our risk management team also did a fantastic job managing its workforce and controlling costs, delivering third quarter adjusted EBITDAC higher than last year by $1 million. Looking forward, we are seeing October claim counts trending similar to September. While we have experienced a steady climb out of the second quarter bottom, many clients are still operating at partial capacity in claim counts have not yet fully rebounded to last year's levels. So we're seeing fourth quarter organic revenues in our Risk Management segment, similar or slightly better than third quarter. And just like our Brokerage segment, we expect to grow our EBITDAC again in the fourth quarter due to expense savings. That means we should deliver on our goal of full year 2020 adjusted EBITDAC coming in better than 2019. That's just an amazing job by the team. Before I pass it to Doug, I'll finish with some comments on our bedrock culture. Despite the pandemic challenges, our global colleagues, together as a team, continued to deliver the very best service, expertise and advice to our clients. I believe it's our unique Gallagher culture that is guiding our team through these challenging times. Specifically, I'm reminded of tenet number 20 of the Gallagher way, we run to our clients' problems, not away from them. Since my grandfather started the company more than 90 years ago, our people have been solving problems and working hard for clients in both easier and more difficult times. And I can tell you this about our culture, it will guide us through the global pandemic, hurricanes, wildfires and any other obstacle in front of us. Throughout Gallagher's history, we have emerged as a better, more cohesive company. I believe we will emerge from today's difficult environment stronger than ever. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thanks, Doug. And operator, I think we're ready for questions. Well, I think for sure, in 2020, in terms of a pressure release for our clients, as we got into the summer, it was huge. I mean it just \u2013 it made a huge difference in terms of giving businesses an ability to keep their employees and to keep their businesses going. And quite honestly, to pay their insurance bills. So I do hope and do believe that stimulus will be brought about in the new year. And I think that, again, will be viewed as a very strong positive for the economy and for our individual businesses. I can't put a specific number on that, Phil. But anything that keeps the economy chugging along, as you well know, our entire business is predicated on exposure units. Thanks, Phil. I think that's a key point, Elyse. This is Pat. When you look at the top 100 in business insurance in the United States alone that doesn't recognize the rest of the world, you still have another 19,000 to 25,000, maybe even 30,000 firms out there that are not in that top 100. And a good portion of those are still owned by baby boomers. So our \u2013 the opportunity to do these tuck-ins is just way, way greater than the large play. Thanks, Elyse. Well, it certainly hasn't been a headwind. And the nice thing about tuck-ins, Greg, is that if you get the right folks on, sometimes they can be terrifically accretive. But by and large, I think when you add all this, it's probably right in line with the rest of our organization. And we're seeing lots of opportunities, but again, you followed us for years. It's not brain surgery, culture is absolutely critical. And I'd like to sound more sophisticated, we try to find people who care about their people, love this business and run a good business. If they can't make money for themselves, they're not going to make money for us and our shareholders. But once they cross that hurdle, it's really got to be about, are they going to fit culturally and are they going to really be able to take advantage of the things that we bring to the table? And I think you've heard me talk about this before. I tell them that when we bring them here to Rolling Meadows or they joined one of our offices out there, we open the curtain and show them the candy store. And they're like, \"Wow, I've got all this to work with now?\" And when that happens, it opens up, in many instances, accounts that are local to them, and we're very strong in our local communities. We want to help them build that strength and accounts that they never had a chance to touch because of their size are now open to them because really, there's nothing that we can't help them tackle. And frankly, that gets them excited. So for us, are they going to stay? Do they love selling insurance, which I know sounds crazy, but there are some of us that were born to do that? And the fact is those people end up being with us a long time, building great businesses having a great time doing it. And it really does come down to cultural fit. But you understood what I meant, right, Greg. There you go. Yes. And I'll tell you why. It's exactly what we told you in 14 when we did our transactions in the UK, Australia and Canada, in particular, and now in Europe and Latin America. Once we've got a platform that gives people confidence that we're really there to stay, then the smaller broker has something to look at, that is not just getting a new name or changing where they send their reports, they get the benefit of the fact that we've got scale, we've got brand recognition and we have capabilities. So yes, our pipeline in the UK, our pipeline in Australia, Latin America, New Zealand and Continental Europe are stronger than they've ever been. Thanks, Greg. Well, there's clearly new capital coming in, and I will tell you that there is zero interest from the people that \u2013 the partners we're talking to at modifying rate increases at all. I mean they're not getting any rate of return on new invested dollars. Social inflation is killing them. Lines of coverage that have been under attack for years while the market stayed soft are raising their \u2013 continuing to raise their head. This is \u2013 I see nothing in the way of softening or stopping the momentum. Now remember, again, we tried to give you some detail in our prepared remarks, workers' compensation is about flat. They make good money on workers' comp. Workers' comp is competitive in the United States, and our clients benefit from that. And remember, our job is to make sure we do everything we can for our clients to make sure the hard market doesn't cripple. So it's not like I'm sitting here and saying, \"Hey, this is \u2013 it's getting harder by the minute.\" But I can tell you, when you talk to the people that are the actual providers of capital, they're not seeing light at the end of the tunnel being yahoo we're back to soften, that's for sure. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Josh. Fees are one of the things that always happen. And this is \u2013 since 2006, in the United States, in particular, we've been completely transparent with our clients on what we make. And we are not feeling huge pressure on the income that we make for the extra work that we're doing today. And that's another reason when you look at fees and what have you, that even if rates were up 25%, you're not going to see our revenue jump 25%. That wouldn't be a fair transaction. But at the same time, there's a lot more work, and it's our expertise now that we're selling that sells a lot better in a hard market than it does a soft market. If it's in a soft market, the person down the street that hangs a shingle out can get you five quotes. We're not getting five quotes today. And you better work hard with somebody who's got some real dedicated inside clear understanding of your business that can differentiate your risk and your approach to risk to that underwriting community or you're going to get whacked. And so our services are more valuable than ever. And you're right, we went for about 10 years. And you'll recall in my conversations on these conference calls, I always alluded to the fact that I don't like hard markets. And everybody would say were \u2013 and when the rates were up 1%, down 2%, up 3%, sideways, flat, that was perfect for clients. It gave them a chance to choose. It gave us a chance to be able to say this market or that one put them together this way, build the tower this way, and it was really another way to show our expertise. Now this is a time where we've got to give good counsel, and they've got to understand that in many respects, it's a seller's market. And we'll get them through it. No, it won't last forever, but now is the time to make sure you're partnering with someone that knows what they're doing. And we're getting paid. Well, the services we provide there, Josh, they're not different in the sense that if you have a workers' comp claim, we're going to handle it. There's all kinds of protocols, state by state, rules, regulations, et cetera. There are fewer claims when you're not in the office, you're not in the factory, you're working from home. There are clearly fewer claims and fewer accidents. And when economic activity regains itself and people come back to the places of work, we expect that those claims will reflect that. But in terms of how you deal with someone that gets hurt, it's \u2013 we still have to file those state rules, and we still have to adjust and adjudicate the claim, which we think, if you use Gallagher Bassett, will give you a better outcome. I'm sorry, you broke up, Josh, what was that? Incidents are down, significantly down. That's the whole reason \u2013 when we talk about claim counts, that's incidents. No. No. No. It doesn't at all. Thank you. I don't think so. I mean, when I look at it, it really is a very interesting market, which is why you see, it was not that long ago that there were very few billion-dollar brokers. Today, there's about 11 or 12 of us. By that, I mean revenue. That's why private equity has been so prevalent in the business, which is good for us because private equity is smart money telling the investment community, we're a great bet. But the fact is, there are thousands and thousands of independent agents and brokers that ultimately have a chance to capitalize their life's work, and I think that's not going to stop. That's right. Hold on. I think the thing that's probably most beneficial to our business that we learned. And first of all, thanks for the question, Ryan. When we look at the business in general and say, what have we learned over the last seven, eight months about what can happen, how this business can be run, where people can do it? How expertise can be exported around the world? I mean, we've got experts in verticals that are world-class. And you want to try to get them to a prospect or a client, you can use up a whole day or two days of travel. Today, they can drop in by video call and bam, they're there and people accept that. So we've learned a lot, and there's lots of opportunities for our business because of that. But I think probably the thing that reemphasizes why we're so high on the benefits businesses, even in this pandemic and even with the recession that hit, the amount of employees that stay employed, the employers holding on to their people, it's incredible. I mean we thought in March and April, get ready, the floor is going to drop out, everybody is going to let everybody go. And of course, I'm being facetious. But the fact is, this war for talent, ongoing long term, what's your product? I don't care if you're making big steel drums, you're a people business. And people are holding on to their folks and our censuses by count have not dropped through the floor. And people are saying \u2013 and as we come out of this, to me, it just makes that business even better, which demands incredible expertise to balance all the costs and all the covers and to make sure that you are, in fact, providing what the employees need, but that you also make sure through communication that they understand that they're better off with you. So it's \u2013 basically, it's really put us in a spot to want to double down on that business. Thanks, Ryan. Thanks for making it easy, teacher. No. I mean, in fact, if anything, it's made it more of a crucial conversation because it's crunching businesses. And when the economy is good and employees are being hired and there's fight over employees over \u2013 because of a full employment, those times are heady times for many, many people. And yes, financially, we can always point out to those businesses why considering a large self-insured retention, bringing Gallagher Bassett in, getting better outcomes on your claims, makes for better control of not only your insurance purchase, but your entire risk management program, and we do a good job of selling that. You put a buyer against the wall, they're all ears, and we're really good at moving people first dollar cover into a form of risk management, risk retention, group captives, et cetera. That is our \u2013 that's our heritage. Well Doug hit on something, Meyer, I think this has been the dilemma that really wasn't talked about during that eight to ten-year period where the market was relatively soft or was flat. When the market starts to firm, one of the dilemmas for the insurance carriers is they need the entire base to give then more rate. The better units of risk look to move out of that buying community. And so now you're taking from the insuring community their better units of risk, leaving them to fight over what is maybe not the best units and even needing more rate. And that is when the competition thins because there just aren't thousands of people that can do what we do. Thank you very much. Let me give you just a quick comment. Again, thanks, everybody, for joining us this afternoon. We delivered an excellent quarter in first nine months of the year in the face of a difficult economic environment. And again, I'd like to thank our 32,000-plus Gallagher professionals for their relentless efforts and dedication. I remain confident that we can deliver another outstanding year of financial performance and successfully navigate these challenging times. Thank you, again, for being with us. We really appreciate it."

Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin. \nJ. Gallagher: Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Also on the call today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We delivered an excellent second quarter. Despite the economic deterioration caused by COVID-19, our teams are executing at the highest levels while we continue to place health and safety first. We are servicing our clients. We're selling new business. We continue to look at merger and acquisition opportunities, and our bedrock culture keeps our teams working together even while physically apart. I would like to thank our 33,000 Gallagher professionals around the globe for their constant and tireless focus on delivering the very best insurance brokerage, consulting and risk management services to our customers. More than ever, these are times when our global capabilities and resources support our local professionals as they help our customers navigate these challenging times and still generate strong new business. That really truly is the Gallagher way. \n Moving to our second quarter financial performance. We grew our combined Brokerage and Risk Management revenues in the second quarter organically and through mergers and acquisitions. And together with our expense control actions, delivered excellent growth in EBITDAC and net earnings. This demonstrates that our investments over the last decade have enabled us to quickly adjust our workforce and expense base, increase the utilization of our centers of excellence, efficiently work remotely, improve our productivity while always raising our quality. \n Let me break down our results further, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was a positive 6.2% and even a bit better at 7.6% when leveling for foreign exchange. Of that, 2.1% was organic revenue growth. Net earnings margin was up 364 basis points, and adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded by 635 basis points to 32.6%. Doug will provide some additional details on our expense control efforts, which was primarily responsible as we drove net earnings up 38% and adjusted EBITDAC up 34%. Clearly, a very strong quarter and pointed the team execute in a difficult environment. \n Let me give you some sound bites about each of our brokerage units around the world. Starting in the U.S., our retail P&C business held up very well during the quarter, delivering organic growth of about 4%. Still strong new business generation, a small drop in retention and nonrecurring business, rate increases offset exposure unit declines, cancellations were not up over first quarter levels, and midterm policy modifications were still a net positive, but a bit lower than first quarter levels.\n All-in, we are seeing similar trends in our domestic wholesale operations, but a bit of a tale of two cities. Our open brokerage business had mid-teens organic growth benefiting from strong new business and rate. Our MGA program binding businesses were backwards about 5%, resulting from a slowdown in programs like transportation, amateur sports and construction. However, when we look at June alone, our MGA and program businesses were showing improvement over the lower in activity -- over the lower activity seen in April and May. We had an excellent quarter in Canada at more than 5% organic driven by strong new business and higher rates. The U.K. delivered 4% organic, and Australia and New Zealand were closer to flat, where we are not seeing as much tailwind from rate. So exposure declines are weighing just a little bit more on our organic. So overall, our global PC operations reported about 4% organic in a quarter, a really strong result in a difficult environment. \n Moving to our benefits business. As anticipated, we saw some second quarter weakness, down about 3% on an organic basis. New consulting and special project work declined in addition to a decrease in covered lives on renewal business, but we are not seeing covered lives decreasing as much as the headline unemployment numbers. So when I bring our PC and benefits together, the 2.1% organic here in the second quarter came in pretty close to where we thought it would be at our June Investor Day. \n Looking forward, so far in July, nearly every metric we are monitoring is trending better than the second quarter.\n Accordingly, based on what we're seeing today, we think third quarter brokerage organic and expense saves will be similar to the second quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, if the economy continues to recover, feels like organic would equal or even be a bit better than the third quarter, and we should be able to continue to deliver cost containment as well. Still a lot of economic and governmental uncertainty, but that is where we are forecasting today.\n Before I leave the Brokerage segment, let me go a bit deeper on the PC pricing environment. PC pricing continued to move higher around the globe, with most geographies reporting 5% or greater price increases, tighter terms and conditions and somewhat restrained capacity. By line of business, property remains the strongest, up more than 10%. Next is professional liability, up over 7%. Other casualty lines are up 5% to 10%, with umbrella rate increases at least twice that level, and workers' comp is flat to down 2%. \n By geography, Canada is seeing the greatest price increases up more than 8%. The U.S. is up about 7%, followed by the U.K., including London Specialty at about 6% and Australia and New Zealand between 2% and 3%. So PC pricing is up across the board, but client premium changes are more modest due to lower exposure units, higher deductible, reduced limits and clients opting out of coverages. \n Looking forward, I see rates continuing to increase within an already firm market and early indications from July point to continued increases in the third quarter. Before the pandemic began, loss costs were outpacing rate and I see just as strong a case for underwriters to push for even more rate in this environment. \n It is certainly a more difficult market today, but not yet a hard market because most risks can still find a home.\n Jumping to mergers and acquisitions. We completed 4 brokerage mergers during the second quarter at fair multiples. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. While second quarter mergers were lower than normal, the number of conversations with potential merger partners is picking up so far in the third quarter. Difficult market conditions and the pandemic are further highlighting the need for expertise and data-driven tools. Our platform is an excellent fit for entrepreneurs looking to support their current clients, use our tools and data to grow their businesses and advance their employees' careers. \n As I look at our M&A pipeline, we have about 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $300 million or so of revenue. Based on the activity we are experiencing in July, we are optimistic we will return to more normal levels of merger activity later this year.\n Next, I'd like to move to our risk management segment. Second quarter revenue was in line with the guidance we provided at our June IR Day, with reported revenues down about 8.8% and organic down about 9.6%. This reflects a dramatic pullback in new claims arising due to higher unemployment and a reduction in overall business activity, offset somewhat by an increase in COVID-related claims. We think April was the worst of it, and I'm encouraged that claim counts in the latter half of the quarter and into July improved off the lows. However, new claims arising are still well below pre-COVID levels. Our risk management team also did a terrific job on cost containment. Adjusted EBITDAC was only $2.7 million lower in the quarter relative to last year and margins held which is also right in line with our expectation. It takes a little longer to turn this ship versus our Brokerage segment. So we would expect to see third quarter EBITDAC improve relative to second quarter and then as our expense actions are fully realized, even greater improvement in the fourth quarter, leading to full year adjusted EBITDAC at least equal to 2019, just a fantastic job by the team to adjust our expense base and rebalance claim loads across adjusters while maintaining our client service and quality levels. So when I combine our core Brokerage and Risk Management segments together, despite the unprecedented economic challenges, we grew our adjusted revenues 5.3% and grew our net earnings and adjusted EBITDAC about 30%. That's truly an excellent quarter. \n But before I turn it over to Doug, let me finish with some comments on our bedrock culture. When times are tough, teams can either break apart or band together. Since my grandfather started the company in 1927, we have consistently expected every leader in associated Gallagher to live our culture, talk about our culture and promote our culture. Culture matters. Culture prevails. Culture is important in the best time, but even more important during challenging times. Our team is together. We respect and support one another. No one is an island. There are no second class citizens. We learn from each other. Everyone is important. For those of you that have followed Gallagher since we came public more than 35 years ago, you'll recognize those statements as just a few of the 25 tenets of the Gallagher way. This document puts our core values in new words, which shapes and then guides our culture, and we believe in it because it matters to us. We live it every day, and it's guiding us through these challenging times. I believe we will emerge on the other side even stronger than we were before.\n Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? \nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Like Pat said, solid top line growth and truly remarkable bottom line performance. Our combined Brokerage and Risk management adjusted EBITDAC is up nearly 30% over second quarter last year. Many thanks to all of our colleagues around the globe for continuing to [indiscernible] on our cost control efforts, all the while continuing to deliver unique insights and high-quality service that our clients need even more in these times. Today, I'll spend most of my time on our expense savings, give you some comments using the CFO commentary document and then finish with thoughts on cash, M&A and liquidity. \n All right. Let's go to the earnings release, Pages 4 and 7. You'll see both the Brokerage and Risk Management segments expanded adjusted EBITDAC margins this quarter. Our Brokerage segment reduced compensation and operating costs by about $60 million versus prior year when you adjust that for roll-in impact of mergers closed after March 31, 2019. In the Risk Management segment, the savings amounted to about $14 million. So in total, we were able to adjust our expense base by about $74 million during the second quarter. That's at the top end of our estimates that we provided in April and again at our June IR Day. \n Let me give you a breakdown of these savings. We reduced travel, entertainment and advertising by about $24 million. We reduced technology consulting and professional fees, $14 million, reduced outside labor and other workforce actions, saved about $13 million. We saved on office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs of about $12 million and lower medical plan utilization by our employees saved about $11 million.\n When I look towards the third quarter, I think savings will be in the $65 million to $70 million range relative to last year, again adjusting for roll-in mergers. This is a bit lower than second quarter, simply because our production staff is beginning to travel to see clients and prospects. We are increasing our advertising costs again. And in June, we did see a reversion to pre-pandemic levels of our employees utilizing our medical plan. As for the fourth quarter, that all depends on what happens with organic. If we're at plus 2% or plus 3% organic, then our producers are likely traveling more and we may restart some of our postponed investments, and thus, we wouldn't see as much savings in areas like technology, consulting and professional fees. But if organic is flattish, we'd expect to see a similar level of savings as the third quarter.\n Okay. Let's go to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our IR website. \n On Page 2, most of the items are fairly straightforward and consistent with what we provided to you in our June IR Day. There's 2 items to highlight, which basically offset one another. First, foreign exchange in our Brokerage segment was slightly unfavorable this quarter, call it about $0.01; and second, in the Brokerage segment amortization, that came in about $0.01 favorable, again, offsetting the FX.\n Flipping to Page 3 to the corporate segment table. Relative to the midpoint of the guidance we provided at our June IR Day, interest in banking came in about $0.01 or so favorable. The acquisition line came in just a little bit less than $0.01, but still favorable. The corporate line is about $0.01 unfavorable, but you'll read in footnote 3, that was simply due to foreign exchange rates bouncing around. In the quarter. \n Finally, clean energy was $0.01 below the midpoint of the range due to mild temperatures, more use of natural gas and weaker electricity consumption due to COVID. Hot July has started off a strong third quarter, but we are still seeing natural gas prices on the lower end and lower economic activity could likely dampen generation later in the second half of the year. So we have lowered a bit our full year range to $60 million to $70 million net after tax earnings. But let's not forget the $1 billion of tax credit carryforwards we have on our balance sheet. That's effectively a receivable from the government that should allow us to pay lower cash taxes for many years to come. \n All right. Let me wrap up with some comments on cash, M&A and liquidity. Our customer cash receipts were strong during the quarter, rebounding in May and June after a slight slowdown in early April. So far, in July, we're tracking back to prepandemic levels. So we don't see any concerns at this time. As of today, we have more than $1.3 billion of liquidity, consisting of available cash on hand of nearly $275 million and we have access to over $1 billion on our revolving credit facility. As for M&A, as Pat mentioned, we did complete 4 acquisitions during the quarter. A couple were tax-free exchanges. So we used a little of our stock but even then with an average multiple paid below 8x, there was a nice arbitrage to our own trading multiple. More importantly, our pipeline is really heating up. So we could have a strong finish to the year and a strong start early next year.\n Okay. Those are my comments. A great quarter by the team for them to continue growing revenues and executing on cost containment. Let's keep the economy from another clench we should pull off an excellent full year. Back to you, Pat. \nJ. Gallagher: Thank you, Doug. Operator, let's go to questions and answers. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming in from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question, Pat, or maybe this is, I guess, for Doug, is on the expense saves. So I guess I have a few questions here, but the first one is, you guys expanded your brokerage margin by 6.2%. So what I think maybe gets a little bit lost in the numbers and if we adjust out the save on 2% organic revenue growth, if my math is right, you saw around 120 basis points of margin improvement. So am I thinking about that correctly? And then I guess there's just some pretty good just margin improvement in your business away from just the base. Or am I missing something there? \nDouglas Howell: No, you have it about right. I think that's right. We had -- no, we didn't give raises this quarter. So that would have dampened to 1.2% a little bit, but you're looking at it the right way. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then I think you guys -- you just provided some good color in terms of the save that we could see in the third and potentially the fourth quarter. If I remember from your June Investor Day, you had said that kind of post-COVID that about half of the saves, I believe, could persist on an ongoing basis? I just -- given you provided some updated figures, I wanted to make sure that guidance still exists today? \nDouglas Howell: Yes. I think probably when we looked at it 6 weeks ago, that probably would have been about right. I think right now, we are learning a lot as a result of this crisis, and we are finding ways to deliver service and advice clearly more cost effectively than prepandemic. But I think what matters in the end is what we spend will be highly correlated at least to how our clients' prospects and underwriting partners expect us to do business. That will determine really how much we travel, how much we communicate virtually. Do they want to be entertained anymore? How much do we advertise? And how do we advertise in the market? And then also it drives what investments in technology and technical resources we are -- that we need in order to service and compete in the market. It also goes further when you look at what it takes to attract and retain talent. That will dictate a lot on how we leverage our work-from-home capabilities, maybe where we locate our offices, how we configure them. And then also a little impact how we train, develop and mentor our folks. So that will influence the ultimate cost savings. And then also, one thing I have to say as being experts in employee benefits, we truly hope that our employees get back to utilizing our medical health and welfare plans. We need everybody to be doing their prevented exams and getting the services they need. Nothing good comes from delays in getting your medical treatment. And that saved us several million dollars this quarter. So when I bring it all back together, over the long term, could we be saving $30 million to $40 million a quarter after we adjust the real estate footprint as we adjust postage express, office occupancy cost, maybe hire some of the external resources that we were using externally. Yes, maybe we could get to that number. So it wasn't far off as a guess, but it will really depend a little bit on how our clients' prospects and underwriting partners want us to do business. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the organic side, Pat, I think you said that the third quarter brokerage organic seems to be trending in line with the Q2, which is a little bit better than your June Investor Day. And then we've been hearing from some peers that there are some lags in some of the businesses, right, so the third quarter could be worse than the second quarter? And [indiscernible] is that business mix that's helping the Q3? Is it incremental pricing? Just a little bit more color on how you see the third quarter transpiring. \nJ. Gallagher: Well, first of all, Elyse, as you know, July is a very big month for us. So it's a good bellwether. And we had a very, very strong July. And so I think as we sit here today, if things don't completely fall off the table in August and September, we feel just exactly the way we phrase it today. \nOperator: And now our next question is from Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nMichael Zaremski: First question. What -- in terms of leverage levels, where could you go to temporarily with the rating agencies if there was kind of something chunkier or larger? Could you go to a -- kind of a materially higher level for a year or 2 and then kind of work its way down if something became available? \nDouglas Howell: Yes. I think they'd be receptive to that. I think we've seen that with other brokers. So that would seem reasonable that they would be willing to accommodate that. Do we have the appetite to do that? We probably won't push our debt ratios very much at all, but I think they could be willing to listen to that. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. And along the same lines then, like -- so in terms of kind of making inroads into maybe the mid- to large account space as a result of the merger that's taking place. Is it more of kind of winning RFPs as the clients look for a new potentially to find another broker because they've consolidated to one? Or is it more hiring or both? And if it's the RFP process, is that taking place more kind of next year when the account comes up for renewal after the merger? \nJ. Gallagher: Well, Mike, this is Pat. I think you touched on a very good subject. But let me go back to our genesis. I mean Gallagher Bassett was started in 1962, basically, to take care of the claims for Petrus Foods with a Fortune 100 company at that time. So we've been in the large account risk management business since the 60s. Now over the past number of years, we've gotten much, much stronger in that business as well, both on the claims service side as well as on the brokerage side. And yes, I think that the fact that the 4 top players are going to consolidate to 3 is clearly giving us more opportunities. And as I said, our capabilities have gotten stronger and stronger, and we feel really good about our chances to expand that business. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. Great. And just lastly, back to Elyse's question, given just a phenomenal quarter in terms of margins. So again it sounds like, Doug, to your answer about kind of -- there was margin improvement beyond just the expense savings. And Doug, it sounded like you were saying that there was over 100 basis points of margin improvement beyond it. And it sounded like that could recur unless business kind of gets back to usual in terms of entertainment and more people feeling comfortable, employees feeling comfortable going back to the doctor's offices. And so it sounds like that kind of underlying net of expense save positive trend could continue? \n I guess it's just -- it's, I think, sell-side estimates, as we know, haven't come up enough because it's just -- it's such a great margin improvement during what is fairly muted organic growth times. So I want to make sure we're understanding. \nDouglas Howell: All right. So first of all, let's go back. What do we think in the future? In the third quarter, we think they're going to be $65 million to $70 million of savings. We won't give some of that back up because there are some costs coming back into the structure. In the fourth quarter, might be closer to a $60 million to $70 million. We might have to give back another $5 million there somewhere. But that's the way we sit today. The margin expansion that Elyse talked about is 2 things is we did have some strength in our supplementals and contingents this quarter, which probably drove a little bit of that margin expansion. Longer term, we think we're learning a lot about our business. And so I think there could be opportunities here for us to do things differently because our clients' expectations have changed in this 4 month period. And the question is, will they stay that way? Or will they expect to see 5 people showing up for a meeting for an hour? Or are they okay with our industry experts not getting on a plane, traveling a day for a half hour presentation. We're finding some really good success in that, that we can put our niche experts at the point of sale, and our customers are much more willing to accept a virtual face-to-face versus a real face-to-face. So there is going to be some savings on that, that survives. So margin expansion, we've always said it's hard to expand margins if it's below 3%. And we are okay at 2% with a little strength in supplementals and contingents. We got a point of margin expansion out of it in the near term. I think it would be pretty hard to post 2% organic growth for the next 3% and expand margins a percentage point a year. I think that would be difficult. Get us over 3%, we can hold in there, get us over 5% -- 4% or 5%, we'll expand them. So I don't see that changing much from what we provided in the past. But there's opportunity there, but -- yes, I think that this in the near term, 1% organic -- or excuse me, margin expansion on 2% organic is a pretty darn good quarter. \nOperator: Our next question is from Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. \nPhil Stefano: Yes. I was hoping you could give a little thoughts on contingents and supplementals to the extent that you have any forward view into them. I guess were there any catch-ups in first quarter or second quarter that we should kind of try to normalize out? In my mind, in this 606 world, the contingents and supplementals will be a bit more flat than maybe what we've seen or at least actual versus what I've expected. \nDouglas Howell: Yes. I think there's probably a little bit -- a small, little bit of catch-up in the second quarter. A lot of these things get paid in the first quarter. We have like hundreds and hundreds of contingent commission contracts and even several hundred supplemental contracts. So we probably will have some positive development in our second quarter a little bit, but might be targeting a couple million bucks on announcement. So the team does a really good job of making estimates. I think what happens in the future because of the pandemic, loss ratios are hanging in there pretty well. So -- and it's -- our cost and value that we deliver right now. I think that we're earning our contingents and earning our supplementals, and I think we've got a pretty fair series of contracts. I think the carriers -- yes, that will hold up well with the carriers. So I don't see anything out of the ordinary in this. \nPhil Stefano: Okay. Look, just to go back to the expense saves, and I don't want to beat this too much. But I guess, in my mind, thinking about the $60 million to $70 million we can expect third quarter, fourth quarter and then the idea that bringing this all together, maybe we could be $30 million or $40 million a quarter, who knows what the normal looks like moving forward. Can you give us a sense for how quickly that gap closes? And is 2020 a pivotal year where things back come back relatively quickly? Or does it really depend on the economy and shelter-in-place and the fallout of COVID in all those ways? \nDouglas Howell: Probably more of the second. It is highly dependent on that. I wish I had a crystal ball, and I think all of us would kind of hope that they come back a little bit faster because that means the economy gets back to zooming, people are back to work. I don't mean zooming face-to-face. I mean, the economy is moving fast and forward. Guys, I think you want to have some expenses coming back in to our number. \nJ. Gallagher: Phil, let me hit that too, this is Pat. We haven't gone to see a client in 3 months. That isn't going to hold up. So there will be bump in your models full of no travel, no face-to-face, no entertainment, no new people. We're writing a lot of new business, and we're going to service that business. And there is pressure in the field to take a trip to see a client. We do have clients that are back at work now saying to come see us. And we've got very stringent restrictions for health and safety reasons about whether we're even letting our people do that. Believe me, we get a vaccine, and our people are going back [indiscernible], myself included. I haven't been on the ground this long since I was 11 years old. \nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. \nRyan Tunis: I guess just thinking about the third quarter organic thinking it's going to be somewhat similar to this. Behind that, what are you assuming organic revenue growth is going to be for employee benefits to get about 2% again? \nDouglas Howell: I think it'd be much the same as what we've got now. I don't see a lot of difference between the third quarter and the second quarter for our P&C business or our benefits business. So it was back about 3% this quarter. \nRyan Tunis: And at this point, workers' comp revenues were down what, you said 10% through mid-June, correct? \nDouglas Howell: Rates are down 2-ish, maybe 3%, something like that. But if you talk about exposure units being down, I can probably dig that out here for you in a second, but let me work on that. \nRyan Tunis: So what I'm getting at is I'm just trying to understand why ultimately you're not going to have some convergence of the employee benefits, which is only down 3%. And obviously, you're still collecting on furloughed workers, COBRA, that type of thing in the workers comp, that's just based on level of payroll. So we're down like 10 on exposures in workers' comp, I'm trying to understand why we wouldn't think that health and benefits will be down a bit more in the third quarter. \nDouglas Howell: Well, I think that it might have to do with the mix of our business, too. As you know, we look at this in high, medium and low impact industries. And when we look at that, and stack it up. We have a lot of business that's in very low impact industries. So right now, you're not seeing the decreases in workers' comp and benefits in those industries at this point, even the medium categories, we're not seeing it. So there could be a convergence on it. \nJ. Gallagher: A big part of the drop in benefits is also related to project work and onetime stuff that we do when the economy is robust. Then people are willing to spend and come in and help me communicate with my people. Right now, they're more willing to not necessarily communicate as well. They'll take that burden on themselves. So it's projects and things like that, that also diminished in the quarter that we'll have to see a return to prior growth to get that kind of project work back. But the underlying health and welfare business does probably look more like work comp. \nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then, Pat, I guess my follow-up is, is it still safe to say that pricing increases are offsetting exposure declines? \nJ. Gallagher: Yes. \nRyan Tunis: So is it fair to say then that essentially, on average, accounts are renewing at basically a flat premium? \nJ. Gallagher: Or down because one of our key jobs is to help those clients in a difficult environment navigate what they spend. So people will take limits down. You had a $100 million umbrella this renewal or this expiration. Do you need $100 million next year, maybe it should be $50 million. Your retention was $150 million, should we take it to $250 million. There's a lot of work that we do around that, that helps our clients mitigate the cost of their insurance, while at the same time, protecting their future. \nDouglas Howell: I am jumping on too. Our workers comp business was down 2% in the quarter, so -- and if our benefits business is about 3%, we're seeing it there, but it's... \nRyan Tunis: Got it. So, Pat, do you think it's sustainable that pricing can continue to offset exposure declines. Does that feel like something that can happen if we really are in a recession? \nJ. Gallagher: Yes, I do. I mean, for now, if you'd ask me that maybe March 30, I might not have been as bullish. \nOperator: Our next question is from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. \nYaron Kinar: My first question is with regards to the cost saves. I just want to understand when you're looking at $60 million to $70 million in the third quarter, I think, Doug, you highlighted a few bad guys there. Are there other kind of positives that you haven't yet achieved in the second quarter that you think you can still dial up? Or is that $60 million to $70 million, simply a decline in the positive that you had the second quarter without any offset? \nDouglas Howell: Just a couple of clarification. We can't wait for our employees to get back using their medical plan. So I wouldn't call that necessarily a bad guy. We want our folks to access our medical plans. \nYaron Kinar: Fair, fair. I apologize for the use of words. \nDouglas Howell: No, that's okay. I just want to make sure we -- but we all know -- we don't want a severity problem coming out at the end of the year because people aren't getting their annual exam. So if that costs us a $5 million to $10 million a quarter, we're happy to spend it. I think that other bad guys, I wouldn't call travel bad, so I won't quibble on that. Do we have some other good guys that could come through? I think that we've done a pretty good job in the near-term of getting down to a number that's going to be harder to keep than it is harder to create more of them. So I think that we're about where we are in this environment. So I wouldn't expect too many good guys to offset the bad guys using your terminology coming through in the third and the fourth quarter. \n So I think our estimates are pretty close. And if you think about it, we gave you an estimate between $50 million and $75 million when we came out of the gates here in April, 30 days into it, and we hit $74 million so I think we've got a pretty good insight about where we're spending money and what's going to stick and what's going to come back in. \nYaron Kinar: Right. Okay. And again, I apologize for using that terminology. \nDouglas Howell: No, no, I know. I just wanted to make sure you... \nYaron Kinar: Yes. And then my second question just goes back to the buckets, kind of high impact, medium impact, low impact. Six months into this situation, as you look back, do you think -- how much of those buckets shifted? Like how much of the -- what you initially felt was a high-impact bucket ended up being in a low-impact bucket or vice versa? \nDouglas Howell: Right. So if you look at it, let's say, there were 25 SIC codes in there what we picked in the second quarter. Of the high-impact 25, we got 20 of them right -- excuse me, 21 of them right, and then we had 3 of them in the medium category that probably moved up to high. When you get to the low kind of the same thing, and the medium, not much. So our pick on low, medium and high coming out of the gate, 3 weeks into this thing, I would say, is pretty damn good. And so I feel fairly comfortable that those are the impact businesses that we forecasted in the near term. We'll see what happens over the next longer-term and whether our picks are going to be right again. But we did a pretty good job of it. So I think that we've got a good insight into the nature of our business. So... \nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Hughes with SunTrust. \nMark Hughes: Yes. Just another crack at the expense question. When we think about 2Q next year, do we -- is this the kind of right run rate on a go-forward basis, kind of a step function on 2Q. And so next year, we go back to your usual template of 3% or better. We get some margin expansion. Is that the right way to think about it? \nDouglas Howell: Yes. I think you've got to go back and reset and take us basically. If you think about, we were expanding margins about 1 point a year, and we've been doing that 70 basis points a year for the last 5 or 6 years. If we get into a 5% organic growth environment, you're going to see us give back some of these savings, and then you're going to also see us just our natural continued margin improvement programs, you would be back into kind of that 50 to 70 basis point margin expansion on 5% organic growth. So you're looking at it the right way. But would there be a reset compared to second quarter next year? Probably because if we're back to -- if you put in $30 million or $40 million of expenses, and you're taking 70 basis points on $6 billion, you get in $40 million. It's about a push, maybe a little expansion. \nMark Hughes: Okay. And then on the benefits business, it sounds like most measures are improving. Pat, you talked about July being very, very strong. I'm not sure if that was completely focused on P&C. But it sounds like 3Q organic in benefits has the prospects of being better? Is that a fair read?. \nJ. Gallagher: I'd say that -- I think I was referring more to PC in my comments on July, Mark, it's only fair to say. I think what you're seeing in benefits now is systemic, and I think that will continue. Now I will tell you from getting into the sales force data, et cetera or what have you, we did have a good July in new business. So people are still looking at needing help around both their health and welfare and retirement and all the other aspects. So I think new business will be good. But I do think you have an underlying softness in what's going forward with employment, et cetera. So I would not be predicting a stronger third quarter. \nDouglas Howell: One thing we are seeing, Mark, we're seeing a lot of people on our webinars. We're doing a lot of joint webinars with -- between the benefits in our P&C business. So there is interest in learning. We did a back to work, safety in the workplace, webinar. So we are getting customers that are interested in thinking about how their 2021 medical plans and health and welfare plans should look in this environment. So that could lead to some better growth in the fourth quarter or first quarter next year as people are trying to redesign their plans. Third quarter, I don't know if you'll see it quite yet. \nJ. Gallagher: Mark, you know that you've heard us say this 1,000 times. 90% of the time when we compete, we're competing with smaller local brokers. And believe me, they're wondering now what else is out there. And those relationships are strong, for sure. I mean, our new business would even be higher. We don't win all the time. But just to put this in perspective, in the second quarter, our webinars, where, as Doug said, we combined property casualty and benefits in many of them around things like return to work. Unprecedented attendance, with 60,000 people attend webinars in the second quarter on content and material that we're putting out. We haven't had 60,000 people attend in 10 years. \nMark Hughes: Yes. Interesting. One final question. This question about furloughs. Once maybe some of these stimulus packages, furloughs expire, maybe businesses just won't hire and they'll cut the -- lose the number of employees at that point, and that will impact your employee benefits business. Do you have any perspective on that? \nDouglas Howell: Yes. One of the things, we don't have that many people that actually have been technically furloughed. Maybe there's 100.5, something like that, that we've furloughed. So I think that what will happen after furlough, we're hoping we're bringing them back. \nJ. Gallagher: No. I think, Mark, were you talking about our clients? \nMark Hughes: Correct. That's right. \nJ. Gallagher: I think -- yes. I think that, that is a possibility. I think that when the furlough support and the unemployment support erodes, yes, I do think you could see those people actually have their jobs disappear. \nMark Hughes: Any sense on the magnitude of the risk there? \nJ. Gallagher: No. \nOperator: And now our next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: Two questions on reinsurance. One is the big picture question. And Pat, you talked to, I don't know, gazillion insurance company CEOS. And I'm wondering whether you could give us their sense on concerns over reinsurance brokerage consolidation. And then second, just hoping you could update us on how Capsicum performed over the course of the second quarter? \nJ. Gallagher: Well, let me take number 2 first. I think I've said this publicly a number of times. Capsicum is the single best start-up I've been involved with in my career. And we were very pleased to get the final acquisition of the remaining equity over the line. That team is an excellent team. They've had an excellent first half and continue to do just a terrific job of expanding that business. And so what we started with 5, 7 years ago, literally from dead scratch today is really -- it's remarkable. So that team is doing a great job. And they'll continue to. The opportunities, I guess I've been -- in my career, I've seen an awful lot of consolidation. I've gone through -- if you look at who is out there competing with us, 30 years ago, 20 years ago, and how many of those have consolidated down, consolidation offers this opportunity. And I think Capsicum is very well positioned to take advantage of that. And I'll be blunt with you. The big buyers of reinsurance don't like it. \nDouglas Howell: And Meyer, we are well over 10% year-to-date organic growth in Capsicum. \nJ. Gallagher: Okay. Operator, I think that's it. And let me just make a quick comment, and we'll say good evening. Thank you again for joining us this afternoon. As we said over and over, we delivered an excellent quarter. It's a difficult economic environment, but I remain confident that we have the right platform and strategy in place to successfully navigate these challenging times for the rest of this year and hopefully, in better times next year. Thank you all for being with us this afternoon. We really appreciate it. \nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "J. Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings call. Also on the call today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We delivered an excellent second quarter. Despite the economic deterioration caused by COVID-19, our teams are executing at the highest levels while we continue to place health and safety first. We are servicing our clients. We're selling new business. We continue to look at merger and acquisition opportunities, and our bedrock culture keeps our teams working together even while physically apart. I would like to thank our 33,000 Gallagher professionals around the globe for their constant and tireless focus on delivering the very best insurance brokerage, consulting and risk management services to our customers. More than ever, these are times when our global capabilities and resources support our local professionals as they help our customers navigate these challenging times and still generate strong new business. That really truly is the Gallagher way. \n Moving to our second quarter financial performance. We grew our combined Brokerage and Risk Management revenues in the second quarter organically and through mergers and acquisitions. And together with our expense control actions, delivered excellent growth in EBITDAC and net earnings. This demonstrates that our investments over the last decade have enabled us to quickly adjust our workforce and expense base, increase the utilization of our centers of excellence, efficiently work remotely, improve our productivity while always raising our quality. \n Let me break down our results further, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was a positive 6.2% and even a bit better at 7.6% when leveling for foreign exchange. Of that, 2.1% was organic revenue growth. Net earnings margin was up 364 basis points, and adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded by 635 basis points to 32.6%. Doug will provide some additional details on our expense control efforts, which was primarily responsible as we drove net earnings up 38% and adjusted EBITDAC up 34%. Clearly, a very strong quarter and pointed the team execute in a difficult environment. \n Let me give you some sound bites about each of our brokerage units around the world. Starting in the U.S., our retail P&C business held up very well during the quarter, delivering organic growth of about 4%. Still strong new business generation, a small drop in retention and nonrecurring business, rate increases offset exposure unit declines, cancellations were not up over first quarter levels, and midterm policy modifications were still a net positive, but a bit lower than first quarter levels.\n All-in, we are seeing similar trends in our domestic wholesale operations, but a bit of a tale of two cities. Our open brokerage business had mid-teens organic growth benefiting from strong new business and rate. Our MGA program binding businesses were backwards about 5%, resulting from a slowdown in programs like transportation, amateur sports and construction. However, when we look at June alone, our MGA and program businesses were showing improvement over the lower in activity -- over the lower activity seen in April and May. We had an excellent quarter in Canada at more than 5% organic driven by strong new business and higher rates. The U.K. delivered 4% organic, and Australia and New Zealand were closer to flat, where we are not seeing as much tailwind from rate. So exposure declines are weighing just a little bit more on our organic. So overall, our global PC operations reported about 4% organic in a quarter, a really strong result in a difficult environment. \n Moving to our benefits business. As anticipated, we saw some second quarter weakness, down about 3% on an organic basis. New consulting and special project work declined in addition to a decrease in covered lives on renewal business, but we are not seeing covered lives decreasing as much as the headline unemployment numbers. So when I bring our PC and benefits together, the 2.1% organic here in the second quarter came in pretty close to where we thought it would be at our June Investor Day. \n Looking forward, so far in July, nearly every metric we are monitoring is trending better than the second quarter.\n Accordingly, based on what we're seeing today, we think third quarter brokerage organic and expense saves will be similar to the second quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, if the economy continues to recover, feels like organic would equal or even be a bit better than the third quarter, and we should be able to continue to deliver cost containment as well. Still a lot of economic and governmental uncertainty, but that is where we are forecasting today.\n Before I leave the Brokerage segment, let me go a bit deeper on the PC pricing environment. PC pricing continued to move higher around the globe, with most geographies reporting 5% or greater price increases, tighter terms and conditions and somewhat restrained capacity. By line of business, property remains the strongest, up more than 10%. Next is professional liability, up over 7%. Other casualty lines are up 5% to 10%, with umbrella rate increases at least twice that level, and workers' comp is flat to down 2%. \n By geography, Canada is seeing the greatest price increases up more than 8%. The U.S. is up about 7%, followed by the U.K., including London Specialty at about 6% and Australia and New Zealand between 2% and 3%. So PC pricing is up across the board, but client premium changes are more modest due to lower exposure units, higher deductible, reduced limits and clients opting out of coverages. \n Looking forward, I see rates continuing to increase within an already firm market and early indications from July point to continued increases in the third quarter. Before the pandemic began, loss costs were outpacing rate and I see just as strong a case for underwriters to push for even more rate in this environment. \n It is certainly a more difficult market today, but not yet a hard market because most risks can still find a home.\n Jumping to mergers and acquisitions. We completed 4 brokerage mergers during the second quarter at fair multiples. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. While second quarter mergers were lower than normal, the number of conversations with potential merger partners is picking up so far in the third quarter. Difficult market conditions and the pandemic are further highlighting the need for expertise and data-driven tools. Our platform is an excellent fit for entrepreneurs looking to support their current clients, use our tools and data to grow their businesses and advance their employees' careers. \n As I look at our M&A pipeline, we have about 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $300 million or so of revenue. Based on the activity we are experiencing in July, we are optimistic we will return to more normal levels of merger activity later this year.\n Next, I'd like to move to our risk management segment. Second quarter revenue was in line with the guidance we provided at our June IR Day, with reported revenues down about 8.8% and organic down about 9.6%. This reflects a dramatic pullback in new claims arising due to higher unemployment and a reduction in overall business activity, offset somewhat by an increase in COVID-related claims. We think April was the worst of it, and I'm encouraged that claim counts in the latter half of the quarter and into July improved off the lows. However, new claims arising are still well below pre-COVID levels. Our risk management team also did a terrific job on cost containment. Adjusted EBITDAC was only $2.7 million lower in the quarter relative to last year and margins held which is also right in line with our expectation. It takes a little longer to turn this ship versus our Brokerage segment. So we would expect to see third quarter EBITDAC improve relative to second quarter and then as our expense actions are fully realized, even greater improvement in the fourth quarter, leading to full year adjusted EBITDAC at least equal to 2019, just a fantastic job by the team to adjust our expense base and rebalance claim loads across adjusters while maintaining our client service and quality levels. So when I combine our core Brokerage and Risk Management segments together, despite the unprecedented economic challenges, we grew our adjusted revenues 5.3% and grew our net earnings and adjusted EBITDAC about 30%. That's truly an excellent quarter. \n But before I turn it over to Doug, let me finish with some comments on our bedrock culture. When times are tough, teams can either break apart or band together. Since my grandfather started the company in 1927, we have consistently expected every leader in associated Gallagher to live our culture, talk about our culture and promote our culture. Culture matters. Culture prevails. Culture is important in the best time, but even more important during challenging times. Our team is together. We respect and support one another. No one is an island. There are no second class citizens. We learn from each other. Everyone is important. For those of you that have followed Gallagher since we came public more than 35 years ago, you'll recognize those statements as just a few of the 25 tenets of the Gallagher way. This document puts our core values in new words, which shapes and then guides our culture, and we believe in it because it matters to us. We live it every day, and it's guiding us through these challenging times. I believe we will emerge on the other side even stronger than we were before.\n Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thank you, Doug. Operator, let's go to questions and answers. Well, first of all, Elyse, as you know, July is a very big month for us. So it's a good bellwether. And we had a very, very strong July. And so I think as we sit here today, if things don't completely fall off the table in August and September, we feel just exactly the way we phrase it today. Well, Mike, this is Pat. I think you touched on a very good subject. But let me go back to our genesis. I mean Gallagher Bassett was started in 1962, basically, to take care of the claims for Petrus Foods with a Fortune 100 company at that time. So we've been in the large account risk management business since the 60s. Now over the past number of years, we've gotten much, much stronger in that business as well, both on the claims service side as well as on the brokerage side. And yes, I think that the fact that the 4 top players are going to consolidate to 3 is clearly giving us more opportunities. And as I said, our capabilities have gotten stronger and stronger, and we feel really good about our chances to expand that business. Phil, let me hit that too, this is Pat. We haven't gone to see a client in 3 months. That isn't going to hold up. So there will be bump in your models full of no travel, no face-to-face, no entertainment, no new people. We're writing a lot of new business, and we're going to service that business. And there is pressure in the field to take a trip to see a client. We do have clients that are back at work now saying to come see us. And we've got very stringent restrictions for health and safety reasons about whether we're even letting our people do that. Believe me, we get a vaccine, and our people are going back [indiscernible], myself included. I haven't been on the ground this long since I was 11 years old. A big part of the drop in benefits is also related to project work and onetime stuff that we do when the economy is robust. Then people are willing to spend and come in and help me communicate with my people. Right now, they're more willing to not necessarily communicate as well. They'll take that burden on themselves. So it's projects and things like that, that also diminished in the quarter that we'll have to see a return to prior growth to get that kind of project work back. But the underlying health and welfare business does probably look more like work comp. Yes. Or down because one of our key jobs is to help those clients in a difficult environment navigate what they spend. So people will take limits down. You had a $100 million umbrella this renewal or this expiration. Do you need $100 million next year, maybe it should be $50 million. Your retention was $150 million, should we take it to $250 million. There's a lot of work that we do around that, that helps our clients mitigate the cost of their insurance, while at the same time, protecting their future. Yes, I do. I mean, for now, if you'd ask me that maybe March 30, I might not have been as bullish. I'd say that -- I think I was referring more to PC in my comments on July, Mark, it's only fair to say. I think what you're seeing in benefits now is systemic, and I think that will continue. Now I will tell you from getting into the sales force data, et cetera or what have you, we did have a good July in new business. So people are still looking at needing help around both their health and welfare and retirement and all the other aspects. So I think new business will be good.

And those relationships are strong, for sure. I mean, our new business would even be higher. We don't win all the time. But just to put this in perspective, in the second quarter, our webinars, where, as Doug said, we combined property casualty and benefits in many of them around things like return to work. Unprecedented attendance, with 60,000 people attend webinars in the second quarter on content and material that we're putting out. We haven't had 60,000 people attend in 10 years. No. I think, Mark, were you talking about our clients? I think -- yes. I think that, that is a possibility. I think that when the furlough support and the unemployment support erodes, yes, I do think you could see those people actually have their jobs disappear. No. Well, let me take number 2 first.

            "name": "Douglas Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. Like Pat said, solid top line growth and truly remarkable bottom line performance. Our combined Brokerage and Risk management adjusted EBITDAC is up nearly 30% over second quarter last year. Many thanks to all of our colleagues around the globe for continuing to [indiscernible] on our cost control efforts, all the while continuing to deliver unique insights and high-quality service that our clients need even more in these times. Today, I'll spend most of my time on our expense savings, give you some comments using the CFO commentary document and then finish with thoughts on cash, M&A and liquidity. \n All right. Let's go to the earnings release, Pages 4 and 7. You'll see both the Brokerage and Risk Management segments expanded adjusted EBITDAC margins this quarter. Our Brokerage segment reduced compensation and operating costs by about $60 million versus prior year when you adjust that for roll-in impact of mergers closed after March 31, 2019. In the Risk Management segment, the savings amounted to about $14 million. So in total, we were able to adjust our expense base by about $74 million during the second quarter. That's at the top end of our estimates that we provided in April and again at our June IR Day. \n Let me give you a breakdown of these savings. We reduced travel, entertainment and advertising by about $24 million. We reduced technology consulting and professional fees, $14 million, reduced outside labor and other workforce actions, saved about $13 million. We saved on office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs of about $12 million and lower medical plan utilization by our employees saved about $11 million.\n When I look towards the third quarter, I think savings will be in the $65 million to $70 million range relative to last year, again adjusting for roll-in mergers. This is a bit lower than second quarter, simply because our production staff is beginning to travel to see clients and prospects. We are increasing our advertising costs again. And in June, we did see a reversion to pre-pandemic levels of our employees utilizing our medical plan. As for the fourth quarter, that all depends on what happens with organic. If we're at plus 2% or plus 3% organic, then our producers are likely traveling more and we may restart some of our postponed investments, and thus, we wouldn't see as much savings in areas like technology, consulting and professional fees. But if organic is flattish, we'd expect to see a similar level of savings as the third quarter.\n Okay. Let's go to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our IR website. \n On Page 2, most of the items are fairly straightforward and consistent with what we provided to you in our June IR Day. There's 2 items to highlight, which basically offset one another. First, foreign exchange in our Brokerage segment was slightly unfavorable this quarter, call it about $0.01; and second, in the Brokerage segment amortization, that came in about $0.01 favorable, again, offsetting the FX.\n Flipping to Page 3 to the corporate segment table. Relative to the midpoint of the guidance we provided at our June IR Day, interest in banking came in about $0.01 or so favorable. The acquisition line came in just a little bit less than $0.01, but still favorable. The corporate line is about $0.01 unfavorable, but you'll read in footnote 3, that was simply due to foreign exchange rates bouncing around. In the quarter. \n Finally, clean energy was $0.01 below the midpoint of the range due to mild temperatures, more use of natural gas and weaker electricity consumption due to COVID. Hot July has started off a strong third quarter, but we are still seeing natural gas prices on the lower end and lower economic activity could likely dampen generation later in the second half of the year. So we have lowered a bit our full year range to $60 million to $70 million net after tax earnings. But let's not forget the $1 billion of tax credit carryforwards we have on our balance sheet. That's effectively a receivable from the government that should allow us to pay lower cash taxes for many years to come. \n All right. Let me wrap up with some comments on cash, M&A and liquidity. Our customer cash receipts were strong during the quarter, rebounding in May and June after a slight slowdown in early April. So far, in July, we're tracking back to prepandemic levels. So we don't see any concerns at this time. As of today, we have more than $1.3 billion of liquidity, consisting of available cash on hand of nearly $275 million and we have access to over $1 billion on our revolving credit facility. As for M&A, as Pat mentioned, we did complete 4 acquisitions during the quarter. A couple were tax-free exchanges. So we used a little of our stock but even then with an average multiple paid below 8x, there was a nice arbitrage to our own trading multiple. More importantly, our pipeline is really heating up. So we could have a strong finish to the year and a strong start early next year.\n Okay. Those are my comments. A great quarter by the team for them to continue growing revenues and executing on cost containment. Let's keep the economy from another clench we should pull off an excellent full year. Back to you, Pat. No, you have it about right. I think that's right. We had -- no, we didn't give raises this quarter. So that would have dampened to 1.2% a little bit, but you're looking at it the right way. Yes. I think probably when we looked at it 6 weeks ago, that probably would have been about right. I think right now, we are learning a lot as a result of this crisis, and we are finding ways to deliver service and advice clearly more cost effectively than prepandemic. But I think what matters in the end is what we spend will be highly correlated at least to how our clients' prospects and underwriting partners expect us to do business. That will determine really how much we travel, how much we communicate virtually. Do they want to be entertained anymore? How much do we advertise? And how do we advertise in the market? And then also it drives what investments in technology and technical resources we are -- that we need in order to service and compete in the market. It also goes further when you look at what it takes to attract and retain talent. That will dictate a lot on how we leverage our work-from-home capabilities, maybe where we locate our offices, how we configure them. And then also a little impact how we train, develop and mentor our folks. So that will influence the ultimate cost savings. And then also, one thing I have to say as being experts in employee benefits, we truly hope that our employees get back to utilizing our medical health and welfare plans. We need everybody to be doing their prevented exams and getting the services they need. Nothing good comes from delays in getting your medical treatment. And that saved us several million dollars this quarter. So when I bring it all back together, over the long term, could we be saving $30 million to $40 million a quarter after we adjust the real estate footprint as we adjust postage express, office occupancy cost, maybe hire some of the external resources that we were using externally. Yes, maybe we could get to that number. So it wasn't far off as a guess, but it will really depend a little bit on how our clients' prospects and underwriting partners want us to do business. Yes. I think they'd be receptive to that. I think we've seen that with other brokers. So that would seem reasonable that they would be willing to accommodate that. Do we have the appetite to do that? We probably won't push our debt ratios very much at all, but I think they could be willing to listen to that. All right. So first of all, let's go back. What do we think in the future? In the third quarter, we think they're going to be $65 million to $70 million of savings. We won't give some of that back up because there are some costs coming back into the structure. In the fourth quarter, might be closer to a $60 million to $70 million. We might have to give back another $5 million there somewhere. But that's the way we sit today. The margin expansion that Elyse talked about is 2 things is we did have some strength in our supplementals and contingents this quarter, which probably drove a little bit of that margin expansion. Longer term, we think we're learning a lot about our business. And so I think there could be opportunities here for us to do things differently because our clients' expectations have changed in this 4 month period. And the question is, will they stay that way? Or will they expect to see 5 people showing up for a meeting for an hour? Or are they okay with our industry experts not getting on a plane, traveling a day for a half hour presentation. We're finding some really good success in that, that we can put our niche experts at the point of sale, and our customers are much more willing to accept a virtual face-to-face versus a real face-to-face. So there is going to be some savings on that, that survives. So margin expansion, we've always said it's hard to expand margins if it's below 3%. And we are okay at 2% with a little strength in supplementals and contingents. We got a point of margin expansion out of it in the near term. I think it would be pretty hard to post 2% organic growth for the next 3% and expand margins a percentage point a year. I think that would be difficult. Get us over 3%, we can hold in there, get us over 5% -- 4% or 5%, we'll expand them. So I don't see that changing much from what we provided in the past. But there's opportunity there, but -- yes, I think that this in the near term, 1% organic -- or excuse me, margin expansion on 2% organic is a pretty darn good quarter. Yes. I think there's probably a little bit -- a small, little bit of catch-up in the second quarter. A lot of these things get paid in the first quarter. We have like hundreds and hundreds of contingent commission contracts and even several hundred supplemental contracts. So we probably will have some positive development in our second quarter a little bit, but might be targeting a couple million bucks on announcement. So the team does a really good job of making estimates. I think what happens in the future because of the pandemic, loss ratios are hanging in there pretty well. So -- and it's -- our cost and value that we deliver right now. I think that we're earning our contingents and earning our supplementals, and I think we've got a pretty fair series of contracts. I think the carriers -- yes, that will hold up well with the carriers. So I don't see anything out of the ordinary in this. Probably more of the second. It is highly dependent on that. I wish I had a crystal ball, and I think all of us would kind of hope that they come back a little bit faster because that means the economy gets back to zooming, people are back to work. I don't mean zooming face-to-face. I mean, the economy is moving fast and forward. Guys, I think you want to have some expenses coming back in to our number. I think it'd be much the same as what we've got now. I don't see a lot of difference between the third quarter and the second quarter for our P&C business or our benefits business. So it was back about 3% this quarter. Rates are down 2-ish, maybe 3%, something like that. But if you talk about exposure units being down, I can probably dig that out here for you in a second, but let me work on that. Well, I think that it might have to do with the mix of our business, too. As you know, we look at this in high, medium and low impact industries. And when we look at that, and stack it up. We have a lot of business that's in very low impact industries. So right now, you're not seeing the decreases in workers' comp and benefits in those industries at this point, even the medium categories, we're not seeing it. So there could be a convergence on it. I am jumping on too. Our workers comp business was down 2% in the quarter, so -- and if our benefits business is about 3%, we're seeing it there, but it's... Just a couple of clarification. We can't wait for our employees to get back using their medical plan. So I wouldn't call that necessarily a bad guy. We want our folks to access our medical plans. No, that's okay. I just want to make sure we -- but we all know -- we don't want a severity problem coming out at the end of the year because people aren't getting their annual exam. So if that costs us a $5 million to $10 million a quarter, we're happy to spend it. I think that other bad guys, I wouldn't call travel bad, so I won't quibble on that. Do we have some other good guys that could come through? I think that we've done a pretty good job in the near-term of getting down to a number that's going to be harder to keep than it is harder to create more of them. So I think that we're about where we are in this environment. So I wouldn't expect too many good guys to offset the bad guys using your terminology coming through in the third and the fourth quarter. \n So I think our estimates are pretty close. And if you think about it, we gave you an estimate between $50 million and $75 million when we came out of the gates here in April, 30 days into it, and we hit $74 million so I think we've got a pretty good insight about where we're spending money and what's going to stick and what's going to come back in. No, no, I know. I just wanted to make sure you... Right. So if you look at it, let's say, there were 25 SIC codes in there what we picked in the second quarter. Of the high-impact 25, we got 20 of them right -- excuse me, 21 of them right, and then we had 3 of them in the medium category that probably moved up to high. When you get to the low kind of the same thing, and the medium, not much. So our pick on low, medium and high coming out of the gate, 3 weeks into this thing, I would say, is pretty damn good. And so I feel fairly comfortable that those are the impact businesses that we forecasted in the near term. We'll see what happens over the next longer-term and whether our picks are going to be right again. But we did a pretty good job of it. So I think that we've got a good insight into the nature of our business. So... Yes. I think you've got to go back and reset and take us basically. If you think about, we were expanding margins about 1 point a year, and we've been doing that 70 basis points a year for the last 5 or 6 years. If we get into a 5% organic growth environment, you're going to see us give back some of these savings, and then you're going to also see us just our natural continued margin improvement programs, you would be back into kind of that 50 to 70 basis point margin expansion on 5% organic growth. So you're looking at it the right way. But would there be a reset compared to second quarter next year? Probably because if we're back to -- if you put in $30 million or $40 million of expenses, and you're taking 70 basis points on $6 billion, you get in $40 million. It's about a push, maybe a little expansion. One thing we are seeing, Mark, we're seeing a lot of people on our webinars. We're doing a lot of joint webinars with -- between the benefits in our P&C business. So there is interest in learning. We did a back to work, safety in the workplace, webinar. So we are getting customers that are interested in thinking about how their 2021 medical plans and health and welfare plans should look in this environment. So that could lead to some better growth in the fourth quarter or first quarter next year as people are trying to redesign their plans. Third quarter, I don't know if you'll see it quite yet. Yes. One of the things, we don't have that many people that actually have been technically furloughed. Maybe there's 100.5, something like that, that we've furloughed. So I think that what will happen after furlough, we're hoping we're bringing them back. And Meyer, we are well over 10% year-to-date organic growth in Capsicum."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Some of the comments made during this conference call, including answers given in response to questions, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings call. Also on the call today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions.  Before we get into our first quarter results, let me acknowledge those directly affected by COVID-19, including those on the front lines of the global pandemic. We are in all their dedication and courage. At Gallagher, our priority is the health and safety of our colleagues. We're very fortunate that less than 50 of our 34,000 associates have contracted the virus, nearly all of whom have fully recovered. With a few that are still self-quarantined, we wish you a speedy recovery.  I'm incredibly proud of how all our associates have performed over the past 6 weeks. In March, we mobilized our business continuity plans around the globe, and we're up and running, working from home in a few days. We are working remotely without missing a step. This is the payoff of our relentless efforts over the past decade to standardize work, streamline processes and operate using common systems. All of our colleagues are productive, too. At home, they have the right tools and systems in order to deliver the highest quality service to our clients. And that includes more than 5,000 associates that are based in our service centers. And every day, we see countless examples of our employees unselfishly giving back from providing first responders with protective equipment, to sending meals to senior citizens, to distributing masks to the less fortunate. I'm proud but not surprised at the level of dedication, support and professionalism from all of our colleagues around the world. I thank every single one of you from the bottom of my heart.  Now moving to our first quarter financial performance for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments. Here are some highlights. We had a terrific revenue growth quarter. Total reported revenue growth of 4% and adjusted revenue growth of 9%, which includes 3% reduction due to COVID. Included in that is organic growth of 3.3%, but again, we had nearly 3% of an unfavorable impact due to COVID-19. This would have been another quarter like our fourth quarter last year. And even with around 2% adverse impact of COVID-19, we posted a net earnings margin of 20.1% and more impressive adjusted EBITDAC margin of 32.2%. And we completed 8 acquisitions this quarter with estimated annualized revenues of $124 million. \nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I, too, extend my sincere appreciation to first responders and those on the front line. And also my thanks for our 34,000 colleagues. You had to navigate your own personal challenges presented by the pandemic, yet we're up and running in a few days, delivering timely advice and service to our clients. That's just simply amazing. So thank you.  Today, I'll walk you through the COVID-19 impact table on Page 2 of the earnings release and how that impacts our organic and margins on Pages 4 to 7. I'll address our expense savings initiatives. I'll provide some thoughts on our capital and liquidity, and I'll finish with a few short comments in the CFO Commentary Document.  So okay. Turning to the table on Page 2 of the earnings release. This table captures all of the COVID matters in our numbers. They are -- they all fully hit our reported GAAP numbers, and we did not adjust any of them out where we show our non-GAAP adjusted numbers. You'll see in the end, COVID didn't have much impact on net earnings nor on EPS, but there are 4 moving estimates that have a noticeable impact on revenues and EBITDAC.  First, let's address how it impacts revenues. And just as a reminder, about accounting standard 606 that drives our revenue accounting. We adopted that in 2008. Recall it requires us to estimate annualized ultimate revenues for contracts and policies with effective dates prior to closing the books, even if those annualized revenues are dependent on future events. We must make our best estimate. And as most of you know, there are a lot of insurance policies that have volume-like adjustments that can occur in the year after the policy effective date. Lines like workers' compensation, employee group medical plans, casualty lines that have adjustable premiums based on, say, future miles driven or flown. Those are just examples. And then you have experience-rated contracts. So there's a lot, so on and so forth. In the past, historical patterns drove those estimates, and changes in volumes would emerge slowly as our clients' businesses naturally evolve. That's not today's environment. Our customers' businesses have been dramatically altered in a few short weeks. That's the reality. So we need to make our best estimates of what will happen in the future for those pre-April 1 contract. It's not easy, but we still must do it. \nPatrick Gallagher: Thanks, Doug. I think with that,, we'll go to some questions.\nOperator: . Our first question is from Mike Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Zaremski: First question. Pat, you talked about being prepared for the possibility that organic could go flat to even a bit negative for a couple of quarters, which I think makes sense to most investors given the backdrop. I just wanted to clarify that, that -- is that inclusive of the Gallagher Bassett segment, which I believe you're alluding to maybe having more of an organic growth impact versus Brokerage? And I guess should we be thinking then that earnings then and margins then given the CFO Commentary, then we'll also go -- would go a bit negative if that scenario plays out?\nPatrick Gallagher: Well, again, Mike, as we try to be really clear that we don't know and we put language in the prepared remarks to make sure we understood that it could be material. But I'll be the perennial optimist, yes. We think that depending on what happens as these states begin to open up and economic activity, we'll see how deep and how long this recession goes. It could adversely impact just to the point, as we said, of a flat to down quarter or a number of quarters. I do think you're right that the Gallagher Bassett numbers, which, yes, are included in those discussions, could be a little bit more hard hit, but we'll just have to see how deep this thing goes.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. Mike, on margins, just so you know, even if we end up in a flat environment for a couple of quarters with the expense saves that we are seeing, we should easily hold EBITDAC margins at historical levels and actually can probably increase them.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. So that -- I guess I'll use that as my follow-up, Doug. So $30 million of charges spread over the next 3 quarters. I typically think of -- in the -- typically think kind of a payback ratio and the payback ratio seems to be very large, $50 million to $75 million per quarter. So it sounds like a lot of these expense saves, should we be careful on our models not to kind of roll them over into future years because lots of this -- some of these things are just going to be temporary?\nDouglas Howell: That's right. I think that this will get us through the trough in revenues. And then I think you have to think about us more in 2021 and '22, if we go back to organic growth, kind of where we were in '19, you would probably see margins like you saw in '19, maybe up 50 basis points for the year. Let's say that we get back to 5% organic growth in 2021 by some hook or crook, you would see probably our margins up 50 to 100 basis points over where they were in 2019. So we can fill the hole this year. And then I think we can get back to normal business, hopefully, in 2021 and '22, you would see it like the trends you saw going from 2018 to 2019. And then so just start with 2019 and pick 2021. That's probably how you should be looking at it. And then in '20, we just hope we can fill the hole.\nOperator: And our next question is coming from Greg Peters of Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: Pat, can we go back to your comments where you segmented out the 20% higher impact, 60% in the middle and 20% lower impact? Just curious how you came up with that. I'd characterize -- as I think about your business, for example, take the aerospace business, I don't hear of a lot of rate in aerospace. And yet, I would characterize that as a higher-impact business. And so you seem to imply that you're getting enough rate to offset exposure. But maybe you can give us some more color.\nPatrick Gallagher: Yes. Sure. First of all, what we did, Greg, is say, all right, let's -- we can now segment our book of business, as you said, into quite detailed chunks. So we sat down and said, what are the industries out there that we think are going to be really hard hit. And those are the ones that we would then lump into the higher impact. So our hotel business, for instance. We can get very granular about how much of our business over the entire $5.6 billion to $6 billion revenue business is hotels. And it's less than $100 million. That's an example. So we took all those businesses that we -- and we just had to bucket them. So it was down and dirty. Hotels, restaurants, those went into the very high impact. Moderate impact, some construction, some transportation, and then low impact would be things that would go on like our public entity business, any hospital business, that type of thing. So when we looked at that, we then went in, we can also segment out. We can look at what's happening to the rates. And we can do that by account. We can do it by geography, and we can do it by type. And we looked at, we said, all right, let's take a look at the accounts that we put in each of those buckets.  And again, Greg, as we said throughout this whole thing, it's very early information, but what has actually happened to those clients that we thought were in the most impacted bucket. Now again, we're cautioning. We're saying this is what's happened in the first quarter and early days of April. So we've said clearly, hotels are going to show a lot more pain in the second and third quarter off of what happened to them in the first quarter. But nonetheless, what's happening to hotel rates? Well, guess what? They're not going down at the same time. So hotels are not going away. They are renewing their accounts. And those that are renewing their accounts are paying higher property rates. Now exposure units are down on renewal. But what we're saying in our prepared remarks is that right now, this bar, you've got a pretty nice offset. And those rates are holding.\nDouglas Howell: And Greg, just to amplify that, we've got 156 sick codes on a sheet that counts for our revenue all of last year. And it's -- there's kind of that 20-60-20 distribution on it, both in terms of -- in terms of our last year's revenues and, like Pat said, eating and drinking places. That's in the high-impact one. You've got stone, clay, glass and concrete product manufacturers might be in the medium, and then you've got legal services that might be in the low. So you just pick out a sick code, we can slice and dice our revenues exactly by that. And then we can tell you by the coverage across the 2. So not only do we weight it by the industry, but we also looked at the coverage lines, too, as it informed our positions.\nCharles Peters: Got it. Do the supplemental and contingents get affected by volumes as well?\nDouglas Howell: Yes. In some case -- supplemental is not so much. That automatically adjusts with the volumes in the quarter. So that's not an issue. Our contingent -- pure contingents, you actually might have a lift in pure contingents if loss ratios are down because of lack of activity. But we do have contracts where there is a double trigger on their volume expectation, and then there's a loss expectation. And that's the one as we look at it going forward, we could have a little softness in that. And we put up about -- I think that was about $8 million of possible estimate reserve for that.\nCharles Peters: Got it. I'm going to pivot to the balance sheet. Just two questions on that. First of all, given what the carriers are doing in terms of rebates, givebacks, delayed payments. I noted that your premium and fees receivable were up quite substantially from year-end. I'm wondering if there's anything in there, and how you're looking at that from a level of concern perspective. And then secondly, I just wanted to circle back on your intangible amortization charge. I think 30 -- in excess of 30 million people filed for unemployment in the last 6 weeks, I got to believe there's more potential risk in it and write-offs of customer lists than just that, but maybe you can add some color there.\nDouglas Howell: Let's talk about the balance sheet. The big difference between December and March is that our reinsurance operations have a very heavy first quarter, and that's what influences that. It should not be looked at as a collectibility issue. Our cash flows during April are still strong. And so we are not having collectibility issues on that. That's not an indication that there's collectibility on those receivables. We only put up a bad debt reserve of $6 million, something like that, $7 million, $8 million this quarter. So it's -- we're not seeing that at all. And so you can't read-through on the balance sheet for that. So that's the reason why the balance sheet is up. The second part of your question was what?\nCharles Peters: Around the intangible asset, the write-off of the customer lists. And just the fact that the balance of what's going on in the economy seems like there's more risk to goodwill and intangible write-offs than ever before. But we're just sitting on the outside looking in, so you have better perspective.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. I can answer that. And first of all, we're nowhere near any type of goodwill impairment on this. As for the customer lists, maybe on the surface, it appears to be that way, Greg. But when you got a -- we got businesses that are really retaining 92%, 93%, 94% of their customers on an annual basis. Just because there's a bunch of people that are out of work doesn't necessarily mean that, that business is out of work. If they don't come back immediately -- don't come back in the next 2, 3, 4 months, maybe there could be. But again, it's a non -- one thing, as you know, it's a noncash charge, but we look very hard through hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of acquisitions during this quarter. And we do it every quarter anyway, and we just didn't see where there's massive falloff. So when you come up with $40-some million across the board of all these acquisitions, that's a pretty small tweak, like I said, it's 2%. If it deteriorates further and we have prolonged business outages, sure, there'll be some noncash write-offs on this, but it's kind of a no. Never mind.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the expense saves. So could you just give us a sense of like the geography by the segment? Or should we think about it in relation to the proportion of revenue between Brokerage and Risk Management? And then I guess tied to that question. Pat,  by saying, right, this expense focus, you could probably expand your margins even as books close. Was that a comment specific to both of your segments?\nDouglas Howell: All right. So let me break this down. And you were cracking just a little bit, at least. So let me see if I -- is there a disproportionate cost-cutting opportunity between Gallagher Bassett and -- or the Risk Management segment and the Brokerage segment? Yes, I think in the Risk Management segment, you're probably looking at 25% to 30% of those savings, whereas that business itself is somewhere around 20% of our total business. So there's a slight skew to that business which would make sense because they're the ones that have the more volume-sensitive -- immediate volume-sensitive type business than the Brokerage business does. So that's the first part of the question. It's slightly skewed more towards that.  The margin question that you're asking is that if we're successful in achieving the expense savings to the level that we've planned for, you would actually see increasing margins in both segments on a quarterly basis.\nElyse Greenspan: And you expect to be at this $50 million to $75 million quarterly kind of run rate figure for the full Q2, right, because you started working on this in the middle of March?\nDouglas Howell: Yes. We might not get -- listen, here it is May 1 tomorrow. We're going to get much of it this quarter. But if I -- if we can get 90% of this quarter, then we'll catch up in the third quarter.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then one more question on the COVID-related revenue adjustments. So just so I understand, so that's on basically -- it's everything as it sits today. So even if we continue in this economic slowdown, you wouldn't expect to see any further 606-related adjustments? Or I guess unless assumption changed materially from what you're thinking today?\nDouglas Howell: All right. Two answers to that is for there should be none of that going forward, if customers adjust their exposure units for renewals beginning April 1, May 1, June 1. So they adjust down, then there would be no COVID-related type adjustment, right? They're just going to buy less insurance, right? For contracts that were basically written -- in January, we put all those to bed. We did all the work for it. We booked what we thought was the revenue that we'd get over the 12 months following that contract date. We had to reestimate what we think we're going to get from those here in the last few weeks, almost a subsequent-event type of valuation of those revenues. Could there be further deterioration in that? Yes. Sure. There could be if the number of covered lives decreases further than our estimates, if we get more audits that come in afterwards if there are more midterm cancellations, you could have a further COVID adjustment. But I hope that we've got it all at this point, but we'll see. And we'll track that for you, and we'll show you how much it was.\nElyse Greenspan: And just one last clarification. Your organic outlook of flat to maybe slightly down. That's an all-in, including your contingency supplementals like you usually give guidance, correct?\nDouglas Howell: Yes. That's right. And let's make sure we understand that. Here we are chugging along and having good organic this quarter. If we have a dip next quarter, and we might have a little dip in the third quarter, our assumptions are by the fourth quarter that we would be back to a decent organic level. And if that pushes into 2021, what I'm saying is I don't see us being negative for, at the most, a couple of quarters. Even then, I think I'd be a little bit surprised.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs.\nYaron Kinar: I guess first question, Doug, I think in your prepared comments, you said that you'd expect EBITDAC margins to be at historical levels maybe slightly above. When you talk about historical levels, what are we talking about here? Are we looking at last three years, last decade? Could you give us maybe a sense of what it is your thinking here?\nDouglas Howell: All right. So let's go back to the margin comment. I think that probably the better way for you to do it to just assume we're going to get $50 million to $75 million of revenue. And if you just hold our revenue flat to last year for the second and third quarter, you can't help but get margin expansion, right? If you take last year, so you're going to get margin expansion even a flat or in a slightly down organic environment if that happens. It will -- if it reverts in the fourth quarter or into next year, then you're going to be -- I think Mike asked the question about it earlier, by the time you get to 2021, if we're chugging out organic like we were in 2019, we're going to put some of these costs back into the structure. So take your 2019 margin and grow it kind of what we did between '18 and '19 and '21, and you'll kind of be there. So you're going to get an increase in margin in the short term, and then it's going to revert back a little bit more in the longer term. I want to make sure that I'm clear on something there. Does everybody understand? I don't know if I misspoke. We think that we're going to get $50 million to $75 million of expense savings each quarter going forward, not revenue saving. Whatever the revenue, it is what it is. But we're adjusting our expense basis down $50 million to $75 million of expense. I may have misspoke on that, but...\nYaron Kinar: I think I understand that. But if I look at the revenue base of 2019, that's like over 4% of margins, right, in Brokerage and Risk Management.\nDouglas Howell: Say again. Yaron, sorry, we got some static on the line.\nYaron Kinar: Sorry about that. I think if I look at that $50 million to $75 million of quarterly expense saves and I look at the revenue base for 2019, that's over 4% margin.\nDouglas Howell: Could be.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. All right. And then I guess my second question is around capital, how you're thinking about it here? I would think you have a lot of disruption in the space, maybe creating opportunity for M&A., besides the fact that you can't really meet with anybody right now in this environment. Are you interested? Has your appetite for M&A increased here? Or would you say that maybe you have a greater maybe as a precautionary measure, more interest in preserving capital and liquidity here?\nPatrick Gallagher: No. This is Pat, Yaron. We are really interested in the acquisitions. This is a time for people now to sit back and take a look at what the competitive landscape was. There were an awful lot of competitors out there with great stories and lots of money in the bank. And now I think there'll be a time for people to look and really think who do they want to be with. And if we can get people to sort of think through the acquisition of their life's work, and where they want to have their people employed after the deal is done, we think we'll do very, very well. So we are wide open for business, and we are not trying to preserve capital when it comes to acquisitions.\nDouglas Howell: You get a little bit of difficult rate and conditions out there in the marketplace, Yaron. And you sit there and say, would you rather do it alone? Or would you rather do it with us? I know where I'd be if I own my own agency. I'd be sitting there saying, how do I go to a strategic that can actually deliver capabilities and resources that will help me sell more business, that's where I'd want to be right now. And we're tightening our belt here on expenses, but we still have -- we're not cutting into the meat of our capabilities. We're -- we can tighten our belt and get through this trough in the revenues. If I were somebody selling, I'd be thinking pretty hard about coming to Gallagher right now.\nYaron Kinar: So I think -- in one of the more recent Investor Days, you had talked about targeting about $1.5 billion worth of acquisitions in 2020. So is that still achievable or something you could do?\nDouglas Howell: Listen, we have the capacity to do that type of ball. I just don't think it will present itself. I think that there's a lot going on right now, getting people back out to do due diligence, it'd be pretty hard for us to spend that amount of money between now and the end of the year. But does that mean we couldn't catch up in 2021? If this is a V-shape recovery, there'll be plenty of opportunities to buy, and we might be a little short for a quarter or two. But by 2021, you could see us having a huge year.\nOperator: And our next question is from Mark Hughes of SunTrust.\nMark Hughes: Doug, I'm not sure whether you touched on this, but your cash flow expectations for this year. If you undertake all these measures and it sort of plays out as expected, what does that do for free cash?\nDouglas Howell: Okay. Let's say, I don't know if I have a number right for you on how much could generate. But the fact is, if we have a little bit of a lull in M&A, right? If we have expense cuts of, let's say, $75 million a quarter for 3 quarters, there's another 2.25, right? And we typically -- we're probably starting with $500 million to probably $700 million even after paying the dividend. So you've got a lot of -- you could have $1 billion of excess cash by the end of the year if organic doesn't -- if it's flat for a couple of quarters or down just a little bit. I don't know if I care either way. You could have a substantial amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the year.\nMark Hughes: Any distinctions internationally, when you look at the different markets you're in, any doing notably better or worse?\nDouglas Howell: We had really a great quarter in our U.K. operations. The organic was very strong in the U.K. So that business there seems to be holding in very well. Early April, returns on that don't show a lot of stress either. So we're having really terrific results in our U.K. operations. Canada had a great quarter also. I think that's really doing well in Canada. Our operations there has really come together in the last few years, and we're running really nice, upper 30 points of margin in it. Australia and New Zealand, they were coming off some pretty hard market there's -- rate environment there for a while. We'll see what happens with the fires happening, but there seems to be good organic growth there. And then in the U.S. we had terrific results, too. In April, I was surprised by our guys, to be honest, they're selling a lot of business. I look at the new business sheet every day. And there are -- our guys are selling a lot of new business out there still here in April.\nPatrick Gallagher: Yes. And I'd add to that, too, Doug, that if you take a look at places where we're smaller around the rest of the world, very, very strong start to the year. Latin America, our operations and, as you said, Canada, the global picture looks really, really good so far.\nMark Hughes: And then last question. I just wonder on the claims count. You talked about the kind of high-frequency claims are down 50%. Anything that jumps out at you about things you might not have expected? Other types of claims that frequency is down, and I'm curious, any observations about workers' comp, specifically. How you see claims there?\nPatrick Gallagher: I think Mark... you go Doug, and then I'll go ahead. Go ahead, Doug.\nDouglas Howell: I think I think we're surprised in the Gallagher Bassett unit about the strength of some of the industries like -- especially like in the hospital sector right now. It's -- claims are still coming in. And we are starting to get more and more workers' comp claims related to COVID also. So our customers are going to have workers' comp claims related to COVID. But the kind of the recurring just manufacturing medical-only type \"back to work in a day or so\" type claims, if you don't have a lot of people working, you just don't have a lot of those arising. So I think that, to be honest, the severity claims are still there. The frequency is down. But again, it was -- it's 10% of our business. And that's -- it's not all that margin fix. So we've got the ability to adjust our headcount on that, and we've used a lot of temporary labor there. We do a lot of contract or contingent labor. So we have the ability to flex that labor pool pretty easily on it.\nPatrick Gallagher: I would add to that, though, Mark. One thing I was surprised at is how quickly on that side of claims side, it began to move. I mean as we saw unemployment requests go up very quickly in end of March, those claims came down very quickly as well. People getting out of work were not filing claims, which is interesting.\nOperator: And our next question is from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler.\nJon Newsome: I thought it was interesting in the CFO Commentary that the expected weighted average of EBITDAC acquisition pricing was down a tick or 2. Is that a reflection of what you perceive as the acquisition market? Or is that a reflection of just trying to be more disciplined in a difficult environment?\nDouglas Howell: I think really when you look at it, when you look at it, Paul, when you're talking about doing 7 deals, mergers across $30 million of revenue, you're talking about a nice bolt-in acquisition. We didn't have any big larger ones in the quarter caps because that was already in our numbers, but we didn't have a Stackhouse Poland for last year. We didn't have a Jones brown up in Canada. So it's these nice tuck-in bolt-on acquisitions. We're still doing nicely in the 8s in there. So that's what you're seeing there.\nJon Newsome: And then I guess do you have expectations when you're doing deals that you'll also see similar drop-offs in revenues that you would experience?\nDouglas Howell: I think it certainly puts -- the idea of growth in an acquisition has always been one of those things that the seller believes they're going to grow x, we believe they're going to grow at a percentage of x. And so we put part of purchase price on an earnout. And I think in this uncertain time, there will be considerably more sellers willing to take more on an earnout because I think they're going to want to grow out of this environment. We're going to want to help them grow. Nothing would make me happier for everybody to come in and hit their earnout. That means they're growing well, and we're all doing well then.\nPatrick Gallagher: Let me weigh in on that. As Doug had said earlier, if you're going to be running a smaller brokerage right now, who would you like to partner with? I'd like to partner with the firm that's going to help me make my earnout. When rates are going up and everything is dandy, making my earnout the way I did it all the time in the past might not be that difficult. All of a sudden, right now, capabilities make a difference.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Two really quick questions. First, it really sounds like, other than exposure units, that things are going full bore. I was wondering if you could comment on the producer recruitment that is a company in that.\nPatrick Gallagher: Yes. We are wide open for producer recruitment. I mean this is -- no matter what the day or the time is in terms of good economies, bad economies, we are always looking for solid production talent, and that's no different now. But as we've talked about the acquisition process, I think that there's going to be a little less competition. Or maybe let me put it this way. We're still one of the few places of size and capability that are happy to pay our producers on what they actually produce, what they're buying and what they bill. And if I'm looking around at where I'm going to go, am I going to go down the street to the Jones agency or am I going to come to a Gallagher, who understands production from the standpoint that we are a broker run by brokers. Every single one of us, with the exception of the professionals, have been on the street. And I think that resonates right now. And we get a lot of people that are interested in. \"Yes, really, how does this work?\" Well, now they've got capabilities with us to go out and pick on the smaller guys and say, \"no, no, no, you don't understand. This is really something we can help you with.\" And that resonates in today's market. So I think that: number one, it's a great time for us to be recruiting; and number two, we're going to have lots of success with that.\nMeyer Shields: Yes. No. That makes perfect sense. Maybe this is a question for Doug. Are we going to see any impact in 2021 from the expense pullbacks in 2020?\nDouglas Howell: So do you think we could have savings in 2021 versus what we put in this year as they got a carryover impact? Is that your question?\nMeyer Shields: No. The other way. In other words, obviously, you were spending this for a reason, which doesn't preclude -- responding to sort of the weird situation, but are these loss, I'm thinking of them in terms of investments, are those going to show up at 2021?\nDouglas Howell: I think you're asking, do we think we're going to have a setback in our progress of building a better franchise as a result of these expense cuts. I think that's really what you're asking. We believe that most of these are immediately consumable type of expenses that if we're not traveling today, I don't know how that's going to impact us next year. So travel comes back, I don't think that's going to hurt us. I think that some of our other belt-tightening exercises that we're doing right now have shown that really, we can bring some of this work that we've been doing in-house that maybe we've been using external consultants for. We actually can be using some things and doing some cost-saving measures that we didn't realize that we had the opportunity to do by sharing across divisions, kind of breaking down some of those silos in terms of being better together internally. How much is it going to keep -- hurt us going back? Maybe a little bit on the technology investment, but we're cutting technology investments in nonclient-facing type areas. So are we going to refresh our website this year again? Maybe not. But if we do it next year, that's probably okay. We still want to make those investments. But that would be an example of -- is it going to really hold us back from selling more insurance? Probably not.\nPatrick Gallagher: Meyer, let me give you a bit of where I think this is going to carry over to next year, which are some things I've been seeing in the last 2 months that I'm really excited about. Number one, cross-selling. I think you've heard me say 100 times that that's one of the things in the company that I'm always harping on. And this, all of a sudden has given a lot of light to that. People are saying from the property casualty side or the benefit side, wait a minute, my customers really do need help. So we're seeing those opportunities grow. We're also finding an opportunity to wipe out more of what we refer to as white space. We know that on average, we're doing, I'll make this up, 3 or 4 lines of coverage per client when they're probably buying 10 to 12. Wait a minute, we're doing 4 really well for you, and you need help on the other 8.  We're picking up those accounts. And the other thing is trading with ourselves. As we've been doing acquisitions, of course, they all come with their London broker. They've been in business with for 100 years. And we explained to them why they should trade with us in London. And by and large, we've done a good job of moving some of that business. But today, when you get a crisis like this and you say, \"Guys, this is really about making sure we do the right thing for the client, and we've got a better group of people in our London office than you've been trading with. No more excuses. Move it.\" They're doing it. So their benefits have come from these bad times that will, in fact, pull over into '21 and 22.\nOperator: . Our next question is coming from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous. \nRyan Tunis: So I just wanted to talk a little bit about thinking about the mousetrap for even like in '19, when we were getting to mid-single-digit organic, clearly, to get there, there was quite a bit of new business that was being written. What was the new business volume? What's kind of been the annual pace of new business?\nDouglas Howell: Go ahead, Ryan.\nRyan Tunis: Yes. No. No. I was just going to say in terms of on the revenue line. Yes, the number, sorry, Doug.\nDouglas Howell: There's two different numbers in there. Some of it, if you just talk about new business relating to one-shot type opportunities like a bond or something like that. You've got that, and then you've got the other, just what's the annual -- related to annual policies that you would expect to keep a client and keep renewing. The way to really think about this is the delta between the new and lost. And we've been getting probably about 2 or 3 points of limp from rate in the past. So our new business has been always outgrowing our lost business, call it, by 3%. And maybe it's more 4% net new and 2% because of rate and exposure, we were kind of toggling to a point really at the end of last year, where almost all of that was -- of the 2 to 3 points for June rate and exposure was really coming from rate, not from exposure.  We had gone through the exposure growth period from 2012 to 2017, and we're kind of -- the other -- that kind of declined a little or flattened out a little bit and we're getting rate. What could happen as we come out of this? Well, you could see another growth in exposure units. It will recover from the contraction. And I still believe that there's rate out there. That tends to -- when there's rate happening out there, you tend to get more looks at new business. And then it also -- you got to make sure that you secure and hold on to your renewal business. So what do we see in next year? I would say maybe a new business in excess of loss business because we compete 90% of the time with somebody less than us, maybe you'll see that widen out by 1 point at least in that spread.\nPatrick Gallagher: Yes, Ryan. Doug can give you the numbers in terms of the spread and what have you. What we saw in the last couple of years, which has been really heartening is that we bifurcated our business or trifurcated into the small business kind of medium and the large risk management stuff. And what we're finding is we've had a lot more success the last couple of years on accounts that we would consider just slightly bigger than the norm in the past. So we have been -- and those have not been coming from taking on our larger competitors. We do find and we compete against  and we do fine, they do fine against us. But as Doug just said, 90% of the time, we're competing with somebody smaller. And what we found in the last two years is we are taking their bigger accounts. They're actually -- we're having more success with accounts that are a bit bigger. So that does add up to a percentage of trailing book of business, which has grown nicely over the last couple of years.\nRyan Tunis: So then it's fair to say that in your outlook for kind of flat to maybe slightly down, you're assuming that you're still going to be able to generate more new business than you lose for 2020.\nPatrick Gallagher: By far. Listen, here's the thing, right. Right now this is my calls every day. This is our time. This is difficult on our people, working at home, where half of them are sturt crazy, bunch of them have kids, it's not easy. They're still making calls. We're picking up orders right now from clients we haven't had a personal meeting with. We're going through what we have in terms of communication capabilities, what we have in terms of capabilities, to help them through, whether it's the CARES Act or what they're doing and what's going on in the market. And they're not getting that help from the smaller local broker. So I'm very pleased with the new business that's actually occurred over the last month. I mean we've actually had it -- it's held up comparative to January and February, which I've been amazed at. And of course, as Doug mentioned in his remarks, our retention is a bit stronger because when we're in a normal environment, that local broker who's got good markets, just doesn't have the capabilities. They could beat us from time to time. So we're seeing our lost business come down a smidge and our new business is up. So now what happens with exposure units and bankruptcies and unemployment and all the rest of that tends to suck the wind out of you. But I'm excited about new business right now. We're a new business machine.\nRyan Tunis: So my other one is just on, I guess, thinking about your revenues, what percent of your revenues are tied to some sort of headcount metric? Like I'm being in workers' comp and employee benefits and also. What percentage of your revenues are -- maybe -- I don't know if nonrecurring is the right question, but I'm thinking about like a construction project. So like to replace the construction project from last year, you need to write a new construction project this year.\nPatrick Gallagher: That's right.\nRyan Tunis: That type of thing.\nPatrick Gallagher: Our entire bond book is exactly what we're talking about. We look at it every year and budget the fact that the XYZ construction company who does infrastructure work is going to be able to continue to do that work. And of course, new projects are going to come up. Now you take those projects away, and they'll drop. Now presently, the government is not withdrawing into those projects. So those that are doing hard infrastructure work, we're going to probably continue right on with that. But you asked a question, a lot of the business, all workers' compensation is predicated, as you know, on payroll. And by and large, what you've got in our entire benefits book, which is over $1 billion in revenue, is tied to employee headcounts. So we are subject to the decrease of employees or decrease in payrolls.\nRyan Tunis: How big is the bond book? I'm sorry.\nDouglas Howell: The bond book?\nRyan Tunis: Yes.\nDouglas Howell: I don't know. I'd have to take a look at. I got to see if I can dig that up for you quickly.\nPatrick Gallagher: Don't have that.\nRyan Tunis: My last 1 was just, obviously, on the carrier calls, there's been a lot of discussion around business interruption. And I'm just curious in how hectic is it in terms of talking to your clients? Are there a lot of claims coming in? Is there a lot of handholding? Or you feel like a lot of the coverages are pretty easy to explain. They kind of get it that type of thing?\nPatrick Gallagher: Well, first of all, you've got to start with. There's a tremendous number of clients who for their own reasons have chosen -- this is why we're getting some feedback. There's a number of clients, of course, that have chosen not to buy business interruption. So we take them and move them aside. Then there's different forms of business interruption throughout the marketplace. And those forms will dictate whether or not the carriers or the coverage. And we represent our clients. We're going to sit with our clients. And yes, there's a lot of activity in this regard and take them through what they bought, what the limits are that they bought, and whether or not it looks as though they have coverage because there are some coverages in the market that clearly cover pandemic. Now there are many others that simply say, there has to be a physical damage to the premises for it to be a covered loss. And there's been strong leadership from the insurance company side, saying, look, we're going to pay the claims that we know we have that are appropriate claims. We're going to pay them quickly. But we're not going to amend our contract, and we're going to have to help our clients, which is what we do, go through that environment. And if they have a rightful claim, we're going to do everything we can to make sure it gets paid.\nDouglas Howell: Ryan, just a follow-up, I did dig a couple of numbers out for you. Last year, we did nonrecurring type business, which would probably include our bonds and everything of about 1% of our total revenue. So if it all went away forever, our organic last year of 6% would have been 5%. Workers' comp and what we consider to be high-impact areas is also about 1%. So 100% of all those employees went away and stayed away and never came back for an entire year and cost us another point on our organic.\nOperator: And our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: And I had one last question. Do you guys have through the years, have spoken about the outsourcing operations that you have in India, it seems like the impact of COVID there has been lagging the U.S. by about 4 to 5 weeks. So I was just wondering if there was -- we should be thinking about any impact on your business within India. And then I might have one other follow-up as well.\nPatrick Gallagher: Yes. I'll take that. I think I just couldn't be more pleased with our capabilities. Those folks have trained and planned and had actually done exercises of working from home. We knew that if any of those locations went down, we could move that work to their home with their laptops. We have not seen any delimitation at all in the service provided by our service centers. And remember, our service centers are now in India, small in the Philippines and also in Las Vegas in the United States. And those service centers have continued to provide absolutely impactable service for the last two months, not even a noticeable change. And while it's difficult for many of them as well to be at home, we don't see that changing at all in the future.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. It's really been a remarkable, Elyse. They -- since day 1, they are trained and they rehearse to do all their work from home. We're a paperless environment there, the laptops come home with them every day. We have -- you get some brownouts there from time to time, where you have a little problem with electrical grid. So we've got experience with them being at home. Internet connectivity is required for them in order to have a job at as a home Internet connectivity. So I'm really impressed with the sturdiness of that operation that hasn't missed a beat.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's great. And then last question. In terms of the expense saves, is there -- can you give us a sense of just by geography, if they might be more pronounced in the U.S., the U.K., obviously, Australia, New Zealand or even within India? How do you think about the geographic base of the expense save?\nDouglas Howell: Yes. I can probably dig that out for you here if I get to the right piece of paper. I'm a little short on it. But I don't see it disproportionately in any 1 location versus the other. So obviously, I would say it's proportional to our revenues by geography. But I'll look at it here if you have another question, but I'll take a look at it as I dug this out. \nElyse Greenspan: Well, that was maybe the last.\nDouglas Howell: I got it here. I don't see it as being disproportionately different by country or by division, other than the Gallagher Bassett matter that we talked about.\nPatrick Gallagher: I think that's probably it for questions. Why don't I just make a quick comment here, we'll wrap it up. Again, thanks for joining us this afternoon. We really appreciate you being here. As you can see from our comments, our focus is clearly now on the difficult, evolving operating environment. I'm confident that we have the right platform, people and strategy to manage through the current environment for the benefit of all of our stakeholders, our employees, our clients, our carrier partners and our shareholders. Thanks for being with us, and thanks to all of our teammates for delivering a great quarter again. Stay healthy, everybody.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings call. Also on the call today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions.  Before we get into our first quarter results, let me acknowledge those directly affected by COVID-19, including those on the front lines of the global pandemic. We are in all their dedication and courage. At Gallagher, our priority is the health and safety of our colleagues. We're very fortunate that less than 50 of our 34,000 associates have contracted the virus, nearly all of whom have fully recovered. With a few that are still self-quarantined, we wish you a speedy recovery.  I'm incredibly proud of how all our associates have performed over the past 6 weeks. In March, we mobilized our business continuity plans around the globe, and we're up and running, working from home in a few days. We are working remotely without missing a step. This is the payoff of our relentless efforts over the past decade to standardize work, streamline processes and operate using common systems. All of our colleagues are productive, too. At home, they have the right tools and systems in order to deliver the highest quality service to our clients. And that includes more than 5,000 associates that are based in our service centers. And every day, we see countless examples of our employees unselfishly giving back from providing first responders with protective equipment, to sending meals to senior citizens, to distributing masks to the less fortunate. I'm proud but not surprised at the level of dedication, support and professionalism from all of our colleagues around the world. I thank every single one of you from the bottom of my heart.  Now moving to our first quarter financial performance for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments. Here are some highlights. We had a terrific revenue growth quarter. Total reported revenue growth of 4% and adjusted revenue growth of 9%, which includes 3% reduction due to COVID. Included in that is organic growth of 3.3%, but again, we had nearly 3% of an unfavorable impact due to COVID-19. This would have been another quarter like our fourth quarter last year. And even with around 2% adverse impact of COVID-19, we posted a net earnings margin of 20.1% and more impressive adjusted EBITDAC margin of 32.2%. And we completed 8 acquisitions this quarter with estimated annualized revenues of $124 million. Thanks, Doug. I think with that,, we'll go to some questions. Well, again, Mike, as we try to be really clear that we don't know and we put language in the prepared remarks to make sure we understood that it could be material. But I'll be the perennial optimist, yes. We think that depending on what happens as these states begin to open up and economic activity, we'll see how deep and how long this recession goes. It could adversely impact just to the point, as we said, of a flat to down quarter or a number of quarters. I do think you're right that the Gallagher Bassett numbers, which, yes, are included in those discussions, could be a little bit more hard hit, but we'll just have to see how deep this thing goes. Yes. Sure. First of all, what we did, Greg, is say, all right, let's -- we can now segment our book of business, as you said, into quite detailed chunks. So we sat down and said, what are the industries out there that we think are going to be really hard hit. And those are the ones that we would then lump into the higher impact. So our hotel business, for instance. We can get very granular about how much of our business over the entire $5.6 billion to $6 billion revenue business is hotels. And it's less than $100 million. That's an example. So we took all those businesses that we -- and we just had to bucket them. So it was down and dirty. Hotels, restaurants, those went into the very high impact. Moderate impact, some construction, some transportation, and then low impact would be things that would go on like our public entity business, any hospital business, that type of thing. So when we looked at that, we then went in, we can also segment out. We can look at what's happening to the rates. And we can do that by account. We can do it by geography, and we can do it by type. And we looked at, we said, all right, let's take a look at the accounts that we put in each of those buckets.  And again, Greg, as we said throughout this whole thing, it's very early information, but what has actually happened to those clients that we thought were in the most impacted bucket. Now again, we're cautioning. We're saying this is what's happened in the first quarter and early days of April. So we've said clearly, hotels are going to show a lot more pain in the second and third quarter off of what happened to them in the first quarter. But nonetheless, what's happening to hotel rates? Well, guess what? They're not going down at the same time. So hotels are not going away. They are renewing their accounts. And those that are renewing their accounts are paying higher property rates. Now exposure units are down on renewal. But what we're saying in our prepared remarks is that right now, this bar, you've got a pretty nice offset. And those rates are holding. No. This is Pat, Yaron. We are really interested in the acquisitions. This is a time for people now to sit back and take a look at what the competitive landscape was. There were an awful lot of competitors out there with great stories and lots of money in the bank. And now I think there'll be a time for people to look and really think who do they want to be with. And if we can get people to sort of think through the acquisition of their life's work, and where they want to have their people employed after the deal is done, we think we'll do very, very well. So we are wide open for business, and we are not trying to preserve capital when it comes to acquisitions. Yes. And I'd add to that, too, Doug, that if you take a look at places where we're smaller around the rest of the world, very, very strong start to the year. Latin America, our operations and, as you said, Canada, the global picture looks really, really good so far. I think Mark... you go Doug, and then I'll go ahead. Go ahead, Doug. I would add to that, though, Mark. One thing I was surprised at is how quickly on that side of claims side, it began to move. I mean as we saw unemployment requests go up very quickly in end of March, those claims came down very quickly as well. People getting out of work were not filing claims, which is interesting. Let me weigh in on that. As Doug had said earlier, if you're going to be running a smaller brokerage right now, who would you like to partner with? I'd like to partner with the firm that's going to help me make my earnout. When rates are going up and everything is dandy, making my earnout the way I did it all the time in the past might not be that difficult. All of a sudden, right now, capabilities make a difference. Yes. We are wide open for producer recruitment. I mean this is -- no matter what the day or the time is in terms of good economies, bad economies, we are always looking for solid production talent, and that's no different now. But as we've talked about the acquisition process, I think that there's going to be a little less competition. Or maybe let me put it this way. We're still one of the few places of size and capability that are happy to pay our producers on what they actually produce, what they're buying and what they bill. And if I'm looking around at where I'm going to go, am I going to go down the street to the Jones agency or am I going to come to a Gallagher, who understands production from the standpoint that we are a broker run by brokers. Every single one of us, with the exception of the professionals, have been on the street. And I think that resonates right now. And we get a lot of people that are interested in. \"Yes, really, how does this work?\" Well, now they've got capabilities with us to go out and pick on the smaller guys and say, \"no, no, no, you don't understand. This is really something we can help you with.\" And that resonates in today's market. So I think that: number one, it's a great time for us to be recruiting; and number two, we're going to have lots of success with that. Meyer, let me give you a bit of where I think this is going to carry over to next year, which are some things I've been seeing in the last 2 months that I'm really excited about. Number one, cross-selling. I think you've heard me say 100 times that that's one of the things in the company that I'm always harping on. And this, all of a sudden has given a lot of light to that. People are saying from the property casualty side or the benefit side, wait a minute, my customers really do need help. So we're seeing those opportunities grow. We're also finding an opportunity to wipe out more of what we refer to as white space. We know that on average, we're doing, I'll make this up, 3 or 4 lines of coverage per client when they're probably buying 10 to 12. Wait a minute, we're doing 4 really well for you, and you need help on the other 8.  We're picking up those accounts. And the other thing is trading with ourselves. As we've been doing acquisitions, of course, they all come with their London broker. They've been in business with for 100 years. And we explained to them why they should trade with us in London. And by and large, we've done a good job of moving some of that business. But today, when you get a crisis like this and you say, \"Guys, this is really about making sure we do the right thing for the client, and we've got a better group of people in our London office than you've been trading with. No more excuses. Move it.\" They're doing it. So their benefits have come from these bad times that will, in fact, pull over into '21 and 22. Yes, Ryan. Doug can give you the numbers in terms of the spread and what have you. What we saw in the last couple of years, which has been really heartening is that we bifurcated our business or trifurcated into the small business kind of medium and the large risk management stuff. And what we're finding is we've had a lot more success the last couple of years on accounts that we would consider just slightly bigger than the norm in the past. So we have been -- and those have not been coming from taking on our larger competitors. We do find and we compete against  and we do fine, they do fine against us. But as Doug just said, 90% of the time, we're competing with somebody smaller. And what we found in the last two years is we are taking their bigger accounts. They're actually -- we're having more success with accounts that are a bit bigger. So that does add up to a percentage of trailing book of business, which has grown nicely over the last couple of years. By far. Listen, here's the thing, right. Right now this is my calls every day. This is our time. This is difficult on our people, working at home, where half of them are sturt crazy, bunch of them have kids, it's not easy. They're still making calls. We're picking up orders right now from clients we haven't had a personal meeting with. We're going through what we have in terms of communication capabilities, what we have in terms of capabilities, to help them through, whether it's the CARES Act or what they're doing and what's going on in the market. And they're not getting that help from the smaller local broker. So I'm very pleased with the new business that's actually occurred over the last month. I mean we've actually had it -- it's held up comparative to January and February, which I've been amazed at. And of course, as Doug mentioned in his remarks, our retention is a bit stronger because when we're in a normal environment, that local broker who's got good markets, just doesn't have the capabilities. They could beat us from time to time. So we're seeing our lost business come down a smidge and our new business is up. So now what happens with exposure units and bankruptcies and unemployment and all the rest of that tends to suck the wind out of you. But I'm excited about new business right now. We're a new business machine. That's right. Our entire bond book is exactly what we're talking about. We look at it every year and budget the fact that the XYZ construction company who does infrastructure work is going to be able to continue to do that work. And of course, new projects are going to come up. Now you take those projects away, and they'll drop. Now presently, the government is not withdrawing into those projects. So those that are doing hard infrastructure work, we're going to probably continue right on with that. But you asked a question, a lot of the business, all workers' compensation is predicated, as you know, on payroll. And by and large, what you've got in our entire benefits book, which is over $1 billion in revenue, is tied to employee headcounts. So we are subject to the decrease of employees or decrease in payrolls. Don't have that. Well, first of all, you've got to start with. There's a tremendous number of clients who for their own reasons have chosen -- this is why we're getting some feedback. There's a number of clients, of course, that have chosen not to buy business interruption. So we take them and move them aside. Then there's different forms of business interruption throughout the marketplace. And those forms will dictate whether or not the carriers or the coverage. And we represent our clients. We're going to sit with our clients. And yes, there's a lot of activity in this regard and take them through what they bought, what the limits are that they bought, and whether or not it looks as though they have coverage because there are some coverages in the market that clearly cover pandemic. Now there are many others that simply say, there has to be a physical damage to the premises for it to be a covered loss. And there's been strong leadership from the insurance company side, saying, look, we're going to pay the claims that we know we have that are appropriate claims. We're going to pay them quickly. But we're not going to amend our contract, and we're going to have to help our clients, which is what we do, go through that environment. And if they have a rightful claim, we're going to do everything we can to make sure it gets paid. Yes. I'll take that. I think I just couldn't be more pleased with our capabilities. Those folks have trained and planned and had actually done exercises of working from home. We knew that if any of those locations went down, we could move that work to their home with their laptops. We have not seen any delimitation at all in the service provided by our service centers. And remember, our service centers are now in India, small in the Philippines and also in Las Vegas in the United States. And those service centers have continued to provide absolutely impactable service for the last two months, not even a noticeable change. And while it's difficult for many of them as well to be at home, we don't see that changing at all in the future. I think that's probably it for questions. Why don't I just make a quick comment here, we'll wrap it up. Again, thanks for joining us this afternoon. We really appreciate you being here. As you can see from our comments, our focus is clearly now on the difficult, evolving operating environment. I'm confident that we have the right platform, people and strategy to manage through the current environment for the benefit of all of our stakeholders, our employees, our clients, our carrier partners and our shareholders. Thanks for being with us, and thanks to all of our teammates for delivering a great quarter again. Stay healthy, everybody."

            "name": "Douglas Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I, too, extend my sincere appreciation to first responders and those on the front line. And also my thanks for our 34,000 colleagues. You had to navigate your own personal challenges presented by the pandemic, yet we're up and running in a few days, delivering timely advice and service to our clients. That's just simply amazing. So thank you.  Today, I'll walk you through the COVID-19 impact table on Page 2 of the earnings release and how that impacts our organic and margins on Pages 4 to 7. I'll address our expense savings initiatives. I'll provide some thoughts on our capital and liquidity, and I'll finish with a few short comments in the CFO Commentary Document.  So okay. Turning to the table on Page 2 of the earnings release. This table captures all of the COVID matters in our numbers. They are -- they all fully hit our reported GAAP numbers, and we did not adjust any of them out where we show our non-GAAP adjusted numbers. You'll see in the end, COVID didn't have much impact on net earnings nor on EPS, but there are 4 moving estimates that have a noticeable impact on revenues and EBITDAC.  First, let's address how it impacts revenues. And just as a reminder, about accounting standard 606 that drives our revenue accounting. We adopted that in 2008. Recall it requires us to estimate annualized ultimate revenues for contracts and policies with effective dates prior to closing the books, even if those annualized revenues are dependent on future events. We must make our best estimate. And as most of you know, there are a lot of insurance policies that have volume-like adjustments that can occur in the year after the policy effective date. Lines like workers' compensation, employee group medical plans, casualty lines that have adjustable premiums based on, say, future miles driven or flown. Those are just examples. And then you have experience-rated contracts. So there's a lot, so on and so forth. In the past, historical patterns drove those estimates, and changes in volumes would emerge slowly as our clients' businesses naturally evolve. That's not today's environment. Our customers' businesses have been dramatically altered in a few short weeks. That's the reality. So we need to make our best estimates of what will happen in the future for those pre-April 1 contract. It's not easy, but we still must do it. Yes. Mike, on margins, just so you know, even if we end up in a flat environment for a couple of quarters with the expense saves that we are seeing, we should easily hold EBITDAC margins at historical levels and actually can probably increase them. That's right. I think that this will get us through the trough in revenues. And then I think you have to think about us more in 2021 and '22, if we go back to organic growth, kind of where we were in '19, you would probably see margins like you saw in '19, maybe up 50 basis points for the year. Let's say that we get back to 5% organic growth in 2021 by some hook or crook, you would see probably our margins up 50 to 100 basis points over where they were in 2019. So we can fill the hole this year. And then I think we can get back to normal business, hopefully, in 2021 and '22, you would see it like the trends you saw going from 2018 to 2019. And then so just start with 2019 and pick 2021. That's probably how you should be looking at it. And then in '20, we just hope we can fill the hole. And Greg, just to amplify that, we've got 156 sick codes on a sheet that counts for our revenue all of last year. And it's -- there's kind of that 20-60-20 distribution on it, both in terms of -- in terms of our last year's revenues and, like Pat said, eating and drinking places. That's in the high-impact one. You've got stone, clay, glass and concrete product manufacturers might be in the medium, and then you've got legal services that might be in the low. So you just pick out a sick code, we can slice and dice our revenues exactly by that. And then we can tell you by the coverage across the 2. So not only do we weight it by the industry, but we also looked at the coverage lines, too, as it informed our positions. Yes. In some case -- supplemental is not so much. That automatically adjusts with the volumes in the quarter. So that's not an issue. Our contingent -- pure contingents, you actually might have a lift in pure contingents if loss ratios are down because of lack of activity. But we do have contracts where there is a double trigger on their volume expectation, and then there's a loss expectation. And that's the one as we look at it going forward, we could have a little softness in that. And we put up about -- I think that was about $8 million of possible estimate reserve for that. Let's talk about the balance sheet. The big difference between December and March is that our reinsurance operations have a very heavy first quarter, and that's what influences that. It should not be looked at as a collectibility issue. Our cash flows during April are still strong. And so we are not having collectibility issues on that. That's not an indication that there's collectibility on those receivables. We only put up a bad debt reserve of $6 million, something like that, $7 million, $8 million this quarter. So it's -- we're not seeing that at all. And so you can't read-through on the balance sheet for that. So that's the reason why the balance sheet is up. The second part of your question was what? Yes. I can answer that. And first of all, we're nowhere near any type of goodwill impairment on this. As for the customer lists, maybe on the surface, it appears to be that way, Greg. But when you got a -- we got businesses that are really retaining 92%, 93%, 94% of their customers on an annual basis. Just because there's a bunch of people that are out of work doesn't necessarily mean that, that business is out of work. If they don't come back immediately -- don't come back in the next 2, 3, 4 months, maybe there could be. But again, it's a non -- one thing, as you know, it's a noncash charge, but we look very hard through hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of acquisitions during this quarter. And we do it every quarter anyway, and we just didn't see where there's massive falloff. So when you come up with $40-some million across the board of all these acquisitions, that's a pretty small tweak, like I said, it's 2%. If it deteriorates further and we have prolonged business outages, sure, there'll be some noncash write-offs on this, but it's kind of a no. Never mind. All right. So let me break this down. And you were cracking just a little bit, at least. So let me see if I -- is there a disproportionate cost-cutting opportunity between Gallagher Bassett and -- or the Risk Management segment and the Brokerage segment? Yes, I think in the Risk Management segment, you're probably looking at 25% to 30% of those savings, whereas that business itself is somewhere around 20% of our total business. So there's a slight skew to that business which would make sense because they're the ones that have the more volume-sensitive -- immediate volume-sensitive type business than the Brokerage business does. So that's the first part of the question. It's slightly skewed more towards that.  The margin question that you're asking is that if we're successful in achieving the expense savings to the level that we've planned for, you would actually see increasing margins in both segments on a quarterly basis. Yes. We might not get -- listen, here it is May 1 tomorrow. We're going to get much of it this quarter. But if I -- if we can get 90% of this quarter, then we'll catch up in the third quarter. All right. Two answers to that is for there should be none of that going forward, if customers adjust their exposure units for renewals beginning April 1, May 1, June 1. So they adjust down, then there would be no COVID-related type adjustment, right? They're just going to buy less insurance, right? For contracts that were basically written -- in January, we put all those to bed. We did all the work for it. We booked what we thought was the revenue that we'd get over the 12 months following that contract date. We had to reestimate what we think we're going to get from those here in the last few weeks, almost a subsequent-event type of valuation of those revenues. Could there be further deterioration in that? Yes. Sure. There could be if the number of covered lives decreases further than our estimates, if we get more audits that come in afterwards if there are more midterm cancellations, you could have a further COVID adjustment. But I hope that we've got it all at this point, but we'll see. And we'll track that for you, and we'll show you how much it was. Yes. That's right. And let's make sure we understand that. Here we are chugging along and having good organic this quarter. If we have a dip next quarter, and we might have a little dip in the third quarter, our assumptions are by the fourth quarter that we would be back to a decent organic level. And if that pushes into 2021, what I'm saying is I don't see us being negative for, at the most, a couple of quarters. Even then, I think I'd be a little bit surprised. All right. So let's go back to the margin comment. I think that probably the better way for you to do it to just assume we're going to get $50 million to $75 million of revenue. And if you just hold our revenue flat to last year for the second and third quarter, you can't help but get margin expansion, right? If you take last year, so you're going to get margin expansion even a flat or in a slightly down organic environment if that happens. It will -- if it reverts in the fourth quarter or into next year, then you're going to be -- I think Mike asked the question about it earlier, by the time you get to 2021, if we're chugging out organic like we were in 2019, we're going to put some of these costs back into the structure. So take your 2019 margin and grow it kind of what we did between '18 and '19 and '21, and you'll kind of be there. So you're going to get an increase in margin in the short term, and then it's going to revert back a little bit more in the longer term. I want to make sure that I'm clear on something there. Does everybody understand? I don't know if I misspoke. We think that we're going to get $50 million to $75 million of expense savings each quarter going forward, not revenue saving. Whatever the revenue, it is what it is. But we're adjusting our expense basis down $50 million to $75 million of expense. I may have misspoke on that, but... Say again. Yaron, sorry, we got some static on the line. Could be. You get a little bit of difficult rate and conditions out there in the marketplace, Yaron. And you sit there and say, would you rather do it alone? Or would you rather do it with us? I know where I'd be if I own my own agency. I'd be sitting there saying, how do I go to a strategic that can actually deliver capabilities and resources that will help me sell more business, that's where I'd want to be right now. And we're tightening our belt here on expenses, but we still have -- we're not cutting into the meat of our capabilities. We're -- we can tighten our belt and get through this trough in the revenues. If I were somebody selling, I'd be thinking pretty hard about coming to Gallagher right now. Listen, we have the capacity to do that type of ball. I just don't think it will present itself. I think that there's a lot going on right now, getting people back out to do due diligence, it'd be pretty hard for us to spend that amount of money between now and the end of the year. But does that mean we couldn't catch up in 2021? If this is a V-shape recovery, there'll be plenty of opportunities to buy, and we might be a little short for a quarter or two. But by 2021, you could see us having a huge year. Okay. Let's say, I don't know if I have a number right for you on how much could generate. But the fact is, if we have a little bit of a lull in M&A, right? If we have expense cuts of, let's say, $75 million a quarter for 3 quarters, there's another 2.25, right? And we typically -- we're probably starting with $500 million to probably $700 million even after paying the dividend. So you've got a lot of -- you could have $1 billion of excess cash by the end of the year if organic doesn't -- if it's flat for a couple of quarters or down just a little bit. I don't know if I care either way. You could have a substantial amount of cash on the balance sheet at the end of the year. We had really a great quarter in our U.K. operations. The organic was very strong in the U.K. So that business there seems to be holding in very well. Early April, returns on that don't show a lot of stress either. So we're having really terrific results in our U.K. operations. Canada had a great quarter also. I think that's really doing well in Canada. Our operations there has really come together in the last few years, and we're running really nice, upper 30 points of margin in it. Australia and New Zealand, they were coming off some pretty hard market there's -- rate environment there for a while. We'll see what happens with the fires happening, but there seems to be good organic growth there. And then in the U.S. we had terrific results, too. In April, I was surprised by our guys, to be honest, they're selling a lot of business. I look at the new business sheet every day. And there are -- our guys are selling a lot of new business out there still here in April. I think I think we're surprised in the Gallagher Bassett unit about the strength of some of the industries like -- especially like in the hospital sector right now. It's -- claims are still coming in. And we are starting to get more and more workers' comp claims related to COVID also. So our customers are going to have workers' comp claims related to COVID. But the kind of the recurring just manufacturing medical-only type \"back to work in a day or so\" type claims, if you don't have a lot of people working, you just don't have a lot of those arising. So I think that, to be honest, the severity claims are still there. The frequency is down. But again, it was -- it's 10% of our business. And that's -- it's not all that margin fix. So we've got the ability to adjust our headcount on that, and we've used a lot of temporary labor there. We do a lot of contract or contingent labor. So we have the ability to flex that labor pool pretty easily on it. I think really when you look at it, when you look at it, Paul, when you're talking about doing 7 deals, mergers across $30 million of revenue, you're talking about a nice bolt-in acquisition. We didn't have any big larger ones in the quarter caps because that was already in our numbers, but we didn't have a Stackhouse Poland for last year. We didn't have a Jones brown up in Canada. So it's these nice tuck-in bolt-on acquisitions. We're still doing nicely in the 8s in there. So that's what you're seeing there. I think it certainly puts -- the idea of growth in an acquisition has always been one of those things that the seller believes they're going to grow x, we believe they're going to grow at a percentage of x. And so we put part of purchase price on an earnout. And I think in this uncertain time, there will be considerably more sellers willing to take more on an earnout because I think they're going to want to grow out of this environment. We're going to want to help them grow. Nothing would make me happier for everybody to come in and hit their earnout. That means they're growing well, and we're all doing well then. So do you think we could have savings in 2021 versus what we put in this year as they got a carryover impact? Is that your question? I think you're asking, do we think we're going to have a setback in our progress of building a better franchise as a result of these expense cuts. I think that's really what you're asking. We believe that most of these are immediately consumable type of expenses that if we're not traveling today, I don't know how that's going to impact us next year. So travel comes back, I don't think that's going to hurt us. I think that some of our other belt-tightening exercises that we're doing right now have shown that really, we can bring some of this work that we've been doing in-house that maybe we've been using external consultants for. We actually can be using some things and doing some cost-saving measures that we didn't realize that we had the opportunity to do by sharing across divisions, kind of breaking down some of those silos in terms of being better together internally. How much is it going to keep -- hurt us going back? Maybe a little bit on the technology investment, but we're cutting technology investments in nonclient-facing type areas. So are we going to refresh our website this year again? Maybe not. But if we do it next year, that's probably okay. We still want to make those investments. But that would be an example of -- is it going to really hold us back from selling more insurance? Probably not. Go ahead, Ryan. There's two different numbers in there. Some of it, if you just talk about new business relating to one-shot type opportunities like a bond or something like that. You've got that, and then you've got the other, just what's the annual -- related to annual policies that you would expect to keep a client and keep renewing. The way to really think about this is the delta between the new and lost. And we've been getting probably about 2 or 3 points of limp from rate in the past. So our new business has been always outgrowing our lost business, call it, by 3%. And maybe it's more 4% net new and 2% because of rate and exposure, we were kind of toggling to a point really at the end of last year, where almost all of that was -- of the 2 to 3 points for June rate and exposure was really coming from rate, not from exposure.  We had gone through the exposure growth period from 2012 to 2017, and we're kind of -- the other -- that kind of declined a little or flattened out a little bit and we're getting rate. What could happen as we come out of this? Well, you could see another growth in exposure units. It will recover from the contraction. And I still believe that there's rate out there. That tends to -- when there's rate happening out there, you tend to get more looks at new business. And then it also -- you got to make sure that you secure and hold on to your renewal business. So what do we see in next year? I would say maybe a new business in excess of loss business because we compete 90% of the time with somebody less than us, maybe you'll see that widen out by 1 point at least in that spread. The bond book? I don't know. I'd have to take a look at. I got to see if I can dig that up for you quickly. Ryan, just a follow-up, I did dig a couple of numbers out for you. Last year, we did nonrecurring type business, which would probably include our bonds and everything of about 1% of our total revenue. So if it all went away forever, our organic last year of 6% would have been 5%. Workers' comp and what we consider to be high-impact areas is also about 1%. So 100% of all those employees went away and stayed away and never came back for an entire year and cost us another point on our organic. Yes. It's really been a remarkable, Elyse. They -- since day 1, they are trained and they rehearse to do all their work from home. We're a paperless environment there, the laptops come home with them every day. We have -- you get some brownouts there from time to time, where you have a little problem with electrical grid. So we've got experience with them being at home. Internet connectivity is required for them in order to have a job at as a home Internet connectivity. So I'm really impressed with the sturdiness of that operation that hasn't missed a beat. Yes. I can probably dig that out for you here if I get to the right piece of paper. I'm a little short on it. But I don't see it disproportionately in any 1 location versus the other. So obviously, I would say it's proportional to our revenues by geography. But I'll look at it here if you have another question, but I'll take a look at it as I dug this out. I got it here. I don't see it as being disproportionately different by country or by division, other than the Gallagher Bassett matter that we talked about."

Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had an outstanding fourth quarter. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments, we posted 18% growth in revenue, 11% organic growth, net earnings growth of 11% adjusted EBITDAC growth of 17% and we completed 18 new tuck-in mergers in the quarter. That's on top of closing our Willis Re merger. Our total for the year, our merger strategy added more than $1 billion of annualized revenue. That's just fantastic. Needless to say, I'm extremely proud of how the team performed during the fourth quarter and the full year. So let me give you some more detail on our outstanding fourth quarter performance starting with the brokerage segment. During the quarter reported revenue growth was an excellent 19% of that 10.6 was organic, another sequential step up from the third quarter and the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement. Net earnings growth was 8% adjusted EBITDAC growth was 17%. And we expanded our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 13 basis points in line with our December IRD expectations. Remember, that's lower because of the natural seasonality of the reinsurance acquisition, margins would have expanded nearly 90 basis points. So another great quarter for the brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and break down the 10.6% organic, starting with our PC operations. First, a domestic retail business posted 13% of organic, driven by excellent new business, higher exposures and continued rate increases. Risk placement services, our domestic wholesale operations posted organic of 15%. This includes more than 30% organic in open brokerage, and 5% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business was better than 2020 levels and near double-digit renewal premium increases helped to. Outside the U.S., our U.K. business posted organic of 12% specialty including our existing Gallagher Re business was up in the high teens and retail is up 7% Both fueled by new business and retention in excess of 2020 levels. Australia, New Zealand combined, organic was more than 8% also benefiting from good new business and improved retention. And finally, Canada was up more than 13% organically and continues to benefit from strong new business trends, stable retention and renewal premium increases. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Fourth quarter organic was up about 7% a couple of points better than our December IRD expectation. We saw some nice sequential improvement over the course of 2021 up from the 2% organic we delivered in the first quarter, thanks to a rebound in global economy, declining U.S. unemployment and increased demand for our consulting services as businesses look to grow. Next I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market. Overall, global fourth quarter renewal premium increases were above 8% broadly consistent with the increases we saw during the first three quarters of '21. Moving around the world renewal premium change which includes both rates and exposure, up about 8.5% in U.S. retail including a 13% increase in professional liability, 8% in property and casualty and 4% in workers comp. In Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K., retail renewal premiums up between 7% and 9%, mostly driven by increases in professional liability and property. Within RPS, wholesale open brokerage premium increases were up 13% and binding operations were up six. Shifting to reinsurance, January 1 renewal showed price increases that vary by geography and client loss experience, loss free programs saw rates flattish to up 10%. While loss impacted accounts and cat exposed property business experienced rate increases that were in many cases double that. So rate tended to be based on client's specific attributes and loss history. And I consider that to be a healthy outcome. So whether retail, wholesale or reinsurance premiums are still increasing almost everywhere. Looking forward, I see a difficult PC market conditions continuing throughout 2022. That's because our risk bearing partners remain cautious on rising loss costs. So property coverages replacement cost inflation and the increased frequency and severity of catastrophe losses are causing underwriters to rethink rate adequacy. On the casualty side, social inflation, low investment returns and the potential for increases in claim frequency as global economies further recover are all potential negative drivers of future underwriting profitability. And on top of higher loss costs and lower investment insurance, reinsurance costs are also increasing. So I think carriers will continue to push for rate and don't see a dramatic change in the near term. We shine in this type of environment by helping our clients find appropriate coverage while mitigating price increases throughout creativity, expertise and market relationships. I'm equally as upbeat on our employee benefit consulting and brokerage business. As you know the first quarter seasonally our largest employee benefits quarter and is looking like the team had a strong annual enrollment season. Early indications are pointing to an increase in new client wins over prior year, consistent client retention and a slight increase in covered lives. With improved business activity and increased demand for goods and services businesses are trying to grow their workforce. But the labor market remains extremely tight with more than 10.5 million job openings domestically and 6.3 million people unemployed and looking for work. This lays the groundwork for robust demand for our consulting services in 2022 as employers look to attract, retain and motivate their workforce. So we finished '21 with full year organic of 8%. That's really nice improvement from the 3.2% organic we reported in '20 and above pre-pandemic 2019 organic of 5.8%. And as we sit here today, we think '22 organic will end up in a very similar range to '21 and there is a case that it ends up even better. Let me move on to mergers and acquisitions. It was great work by the team to close the reinsurance acquisition in early December. Integration is well under way and progressing at a good pace. Remember, we are a seasoned integrator. On the revenue side, much like our tuck-in acquisitions, we've mobilized our local teams from retail, wholesale and even Gallagher Bassett to partner with our new colleagues and generate new revenue opportunities. I'm also very pleased that our combined Gallagher Re team hit the ground running and had a strong finish to the year. Financially, the acquisition added about 20 million of revenue in December and as expected generated a small EBITDAC loss due to seasonality. More importantly, I'm already seeing examples of cross division cooperation and collaboration. So our new reinsurance colleagues are quickly embracing our Better Together Gallagher culture. Outside of reinsurance, we completed 18 tuck-in brokerage mergers during the quarter, representing about $65 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have around 35 term sheets signed are being prepared representing over $200 million of annualized revenues. We know all these will not close however, we believe we'll get our fair share. Next, I'd like to move to our risk management segment Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic was 13.1% a bit better than our December IRD expectation, margins approached 19% in the quarter, leading to full year adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.1%. Another great quarter and full year for that matter from the team. We saw more new arising claims within General Liability and Property and to a lesser extent co-workers compensation during the quarter. New COVID related workers comp claims were similar to the third quarter dated slightly by the late year surge in cases from Omicron variant. Regardless of the short-term variability of new rising claim activity, we feel really good about the business. Looking forward continued strong retention, combined with new client wins in the fourth quarter should drive '22 organic into the high single digit range. So it was another fantastic year for our franchise and I'm extremely proud of our team and our collective accomplishments. Together, we produced 8.6% organic growth in our combined brokerage and risk management segments, completed 38 mergers with more than $1 billion of estimated annualized revenue, more than 110 basis points of adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion. And we were recognized as one of the world's most ethical companies for the 10th year in a row by the Ethisphere Institute and all this in the face of a pandemic. What a fantastic year, more than ever, our success is due to our bedrock culture. Our culture helps us deliver better results, better results for all of our stakeholders, including our customers, our colleagues, our underwriting partners, and of course, our shareholders. Every day, all of our teammates get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and to live our culture. That truly is the Gallagher way. Okay, I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Pat. And hello, everyone. As Pat said a terrific quarter to close out in an outstanding year. Today, I'll start with our earnings release and touch on organic margins and our corporate segment shortcut table. Then I'll move to our CFO commentary document where there I'll talk a little bit about how we're now providing our their typical modeling helpers for '22, add some commentary in the Willis Re acquisition and our latest thinking on clean energy. I'll then finish up with my comments on cash liquidity and capital management. Okay, let's flip the page for the earnings release to the brokerage segment, organic table. All in brokerage organic was 10.6% a nice step up from the 9% we posted last. And the six plus percent we posted in the first half of '21 leading to full year organic of 8%. Looking forward as Pat said, we see full year '22 similar to '21 or even better. Now turn to page six for the brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Headline all in adjusted margin expansion for fourth quarter was 13 basis points right in line with our December IRD expectation. But recall that expansion has the adverse seasonal impact of closing Willis Re on December 1. Without that, adjusted margins would have expanded 88 basis points also right in line with the forecast we provided in December. For full year adjusted margin expansion was 123 basis points. Excluding Willis Re, it was up 142 basis points. And it's important not to forget, that's on top of 420 basis points of adjusted margin expansion in '20 and 75 basis points in '19. That's absolutely incredible execution before during and as we emerge from the pandemic. Moving on from '21. Looking forward, as the pandemic limitations continue to ease in '22, we will naturally see some costs returning in areas such as travel, entertainment and perhaps some other office consumables. Incremental full year '22 costs from these three areas could be as much as 25 million. But even then, our full year spend on these categories would be below pre-pandemic levels, showing that we're holding safe. Also, we're back to making targeted investments to drive long-term growth. In '22, we're planning for increases in marketing, advertising, consulting, professional fees and certain IT investments. These costs combined with higher insurance premiums say for E&O, D&O and work comp would total around 35 million. So like we said in our December IR Day, we should be able to absorb those costs and hold margins if we post around 7% organic. And if organic is over 7% even show some margin expansion. Then by 2023, we could be back to that pre-pandemic view that margin expansion might occur at a 4% or so organic level. And to be clear, all of these comments are before the impact of the acquisition of Willis Re. On a pro forma basis, those margins can run a bit higher. So math would say would naturally provide some lift to our consolidated brokerage segment margins in '22. A couple of things to keep in mind as you build your quarterly models for our brokerage segment in 2022. First consider seasonality, due to our benefits business, and now our larger reinsurance business, first quarter seasonality, our first quarter is our largest revenue in EBITDAC of the quarter of the year. And second perhaps slightly more nuanced, since we're not seeing price and or exposure increases in benefits and workers comp to the extent we are in other areas of PNC insurance. First quarter organic might be a point or so below your full year pick simply due to the mix. So the math would then suggest their second, third and fourth quarters could post over your full year organic pick. Again, that's just a nuance to help you with your quarterly model. Moving on to the risk management segment and the organic table at the bottom of Page Six, you'll see 13.1% organic in the fourth quarter and full year organic in excess of 12%. What a great rebound from the depths of the pandemic. And as Pat said, it's looking like revenue momentum continues into '22 with full year organic revenue growth in the high single digits, which is really terrific given '22 will naturally have more difficult compares than '21. Moving to the risk management segment EBITDAC table on page seven. Adjusted EBITDAC margin of 18.6% in the quarter and more than 19% for the full year, a fantastic result. And just like our brokerage segment, a nice step up from pre-pandemic levels of 17.5%. Again, that demonstrates our ability to maintain a portion of our pandemic period savings even as we make some further investment in technology investments. Looking forward, as you heard on our December IR Day, we will continue to make investments in analytics and tools to enhance the client experience and drive better claim outcomes. But even with those holding margins close to that 19% is achievable for full year \u201822. All right, let's turn to page eight to the corporate segment table. In total, adjusted results $0.02 better than the midpoint of our December IR Day forecast, mostly as a result of strong clean energy earnings. We did have a couple of notable adjustments this quarter. First Willis Re transaction related costs, as discussed in footnote two were 22 million after tax. And second, as discussed in footnote three and similar to third quarter, we had non-cash, deferred tax adjustments related to international M&A earnouts, which is the most of it as well as some other small tax and legal settlement items together about 19 million after tax. Now let's shift to our CFO commentary document we post on our website starting with page three. As for fourth quarter, you'll see most of the brokerage and risk management items are close to our December IR Day estimates. Also on that page, we are now providing our first look at items related to the brokerage and risk management segment. A couple lines we're highlighting, first FX, the late '21 and early '22 weakening of the U.S. dollar against our major currencies is creating about a $0.04 headwind to EPS next year. Second integration costs. You'll read in footnote one, the integration estimates provided here only reflect expense associated with Willis Re. As Pat mentioned, integration is well underway and we are still comfortable with our ultimate pack of about $250 million of total costs for integration. All right, let's turn to page five of the CFO commentary, the page addressing clean energy. The purpose of this page is to highlight we are transitioning from over a decade of showing GAAP earnings to a six-day period where we harvest cash flows. You'll see in the blue column that we reported '21 GAAP earnings of 97.4 million, a really nice step up, up 39% over '20 and we generated 40 million of net after tax cash flow. So also a nice step up from '20. But the real headline story here is in the pinkish column. Cash flows take a significant step up in '22, looks like we'll be harvesting $125 million to $150 million a year of cash flows and perhaps even more in '23 and beyond. Now there is still a possibility of an extension in the law and we're well positioned to restart production if that happens, but if not, we have over a billion dollars of credit carryovers. If we use say $150 million a year that's a seven year cash flow sweetener. Flipping to page six in the rollover revenue table. The reinsurance acquisition is off to a solid start and we are encouraged with both its December results and early indications from the 1-1 renewal season. So it's looking like our pro forma revenue and EBITDAC of 745 million and 265 million respectively, are holding up nicely. So the reinsurance acquisition is off to a terrific start. All right, as for the cash and capital management future M&A. At December 31, available cash on hand is about 300 million with strong operating cash flows expected in '22. And potentially a nice pumping cash flow from our clean energy investments, we are extremely well positioned to fund future tuck-in M&A using cash and debt. Over the next two years, we could do over $4 billion of M&A without using any stock. You also see that our Board of Directors announced a $0.03 per share increase to our quarterly dividend, that would imply an annual payout of $2.04 per share. That's a 6.3% increase over 2021. Finally, one calendar item, we are planning on our regular mid quarter IR Day from 8 am to 10 am, Central Time on March 16. Again, that will most likely be virtual. During that we will allocate some time to socialize our planned migration to reporting adjusted GAAP EPS results excluding the impact of non-cash intangible asset amortization. We'll discuss the detail of all the adjustments including representing historical results on the new basis. Okay, that's it. From my vantage point, as CFO we are extremely well positioned for another great year here in '22. Before I turn it back over to you, Pat, I'd like to thank the entire Gallagher team for a terrific quarter and fantastic year. Pat?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Doug. Operator, let's go to questions and answers please.\nOperator: Thank you. The call is now open for questions.  Our first question is from Mike Zaremski of Wolfe research.\nCharlie Lederer: Hey, guys, this is actually Charlie on for Mike. So organic growth in the back half of the year has been outstanding and has been accelerating. But pricing while positive seems to be decelerating and GDP is decelerating as well. Can you provide some color on what makes you comfortable with guiding us to organic growth at almost two times your historical level?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: We think that the rates are going to hold. It's just that simple. market falls out. They won't, market holds the way it is, it will. I'd see all kinds of reasons for it to continue, as laid out in my prepared remarks. But beyond that, you've got a situation where underwriters are not backing off from their need for rate. We're seeing that every single day. We're into the renewals, obviously now deep into the first quarter. And we're not seeing rate relief in any way, shape or form along the lines of what I talked about in my remarks.\nDoug Howell: I still think there's a lot of pent-up exposure unit growth that still to come. We think there's inflation sitting there. We think that there's a need for our benefit consulting advice, more and more. We think that wholesaling markets are becoming tough and harder to find placements. We think there are more accelerators when it comes to that then there are maybe a slight, 0.5 point pullback in what the underwriters are asking for in re that far overshadows it.\nCharlie Lederer: Got it. That's great color. And then, on M&A. I guess there's -- I know you said the integration is going well. Does the reinsurance transaction have any impact on M&A decisions this year? Or is there any chance you don't spend your entire free cash flow because of it?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Of course, I said we think we have 4 billion to spend over the next couple of years. I think that's almost 2 billion next year and a little over 2 billion in the final year. So we have plenty of free cash to fund acquisition our pipeline. It does get a little slower in the first quarter. There's people that push more to have something done by year end and we have that happen every year. But we're pretty excited about what we're seeing in our pipeline right now.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Greg Peters of Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: I know I can't do it Doug, but I'm wondering if you can say pre-pandemic 10 times really fast.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Pre-pandemic, Pre-pandemic.\nDoug Howell: Obviously, I don\u2019t know. I couldn\u2019t.\nGreg Peters: I'm just teasing. So let's see, I had a question about the M&A. And I was looking in the CFO commentary on page three. And of course, Pat, you always give us a view on term sheets, outstanding, et cetera. So, two-part question. When you give us term sheet numbers, the number of term -- sheets that are out there, and then ultimately, to close, can you talk about how that ratio, the close rate has changed over the last two or three years? And then, secondly, on page three of the supplement Doug, you drop in, you give us the quarterly weighted average multiple of EBITDAC tuck-in. And it's definitely trending up. So I'm just curious about your views there.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes, great. Let me take the first part of your question. When we get to an actual term sheet, we're usually moving down, especially in our tuck-ins, we're usually moving down a path where we're going to do a deal. And one of the things about our reputation is that we will close. Having said that, over the last two to three years, there's considerably more competition, you can take a $5 million deal today and if it's going to get spreadsheet, there'll be a dozen, really thinking of a dozen bids. So we are really trying hard to make sure that all of our new partners are excited about what the future provides being part of Gallagher, which quite honestly, we think is substantially better and more exciting than our private equity competitors. But that doesn't diminish the fact that they're good competitors and they're smart people. And they're well funded. So I don't have a number for you specifically, I can't say, oh, yeah, we closed 32% of the ones that we finally get to. We don't keep the records that way. I don't do that. But anecdotally, I'll tell you that we should close more than half of the ones that we get to we have a signed term sheet, while I will take it back, we should close 90% of the ones where we have a signed term sheet, 10% will slip out of the net. And where we're preparing term sheets, we should close about half of those.\nDoug Howell: In terms of the multiple Greg. Yes, the multiples ticked up a little bit, not as much as what our multiple has. So there's still a terrific arbitrage there. But also, you have to realize the growth rates that drive those multiples have gone up quite a bit, too. So I think there's justification for higher multiples. But we're still buying in that eight to 10 range when it comes to tuck-in acquisition. It's a pretty good run rate versus our trading multiple of 15, 16, 17.\nGreg Peters: Got it out. I guess, a follow up question. It's been a rough start to the year for the market. And for the insurance brokerage stocks and your stock too is traded off a little bit. And it feels like at times, some are speculating that the best for their brokerage space is in the rearview mirror. Yet, the rhetoric from you, Marsh and Brown & Brown are directly polar opposite, it seem to map out a pretty optimistic future. So I guess I'm just trying to gauge what your perspective is on the market, considering that the stock market certainly doesn't seem to appreciate what you guys are doing at this moment in time.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, Greg, this is Pat. Normally for 20 years, and there's never been a time in that period where I've been as bullish as I am today. I mean, everything, everything is going our way. So let me try not to spend 20 minutes answering your question here. But let's start with the fact that we've never been stronger. Vertical capabilities are absolutely critical. Data and analytics are absolutely critical. When you take a look at the volumes that we now have that we can do the data and analytics around we can tell you what's happening by day with rates and renewals or what have you. 10 years ago, we flew blind totally on that customer asked why do I have even know I've got a good deal with the rate environment going like it is. We can show them what's happening to the rates by line, by geography and why they have a good deal. And that type of question is getting asked right into the middle market. And over 90% of the time when we compete, we compete with a smaller competitor. That's why these people are selling to private equity. That's why these roll ups are working. And I'm telling you it's unbelievable the opportunity we have right now. So I see this is the greatest buying opportunity in the last five years.\nGreg Peters: Yes. Just in your answer. And it was part of your comments, you talked about the difficult risk bearing market and driving further rate. And listen, I, you're looking at a global picture, so but I look at reported results, Travelers was out with an 88% combined ratio, Berkeley just came out with an 88% combined ratio tonight. It seems like the risk bearers are -- the results are beginning to improve. And so I guess it lends the question, what are we missing when you say it's difficult risk bearing market?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, let's start with inflation. You've done all your actuarial work at a 2% inflation rate. And now it's six. Oh, yeah, that was a blip on the radar, was going to be gone by now. I guess that's not going to happen. Secondly, let's look at last costs. What does it cost to build a house today? Well, we got it done for $200 a square foot a few years ago, certainly isn't that now. And I could go on and on and on. I mean, the level of nuclear, the number of nuclear settlements. The other thing too is, I've been saying this now for years, I think it's more true than ever. Our underwriters or our underwriting partners are very, very smart. And they've got incredible data and analytic skills. They know where they're making money in that 88% everywhere around the world every day and they know where they're not making money. And you walk in and start talking about a deal that you want to broker, it's something that's going to be substantially less than they know, they'll get or deserve. They're just not buying it.\nDoug Howell: I think, Greg, there's also some things, x cat, x reserve releases, I think, and then the prospect of just inflation just have a reserve be coming in, let's say just 10% more than what the original estimate was. That's a huge difference on a combined ratio. So I think that the -- I'm not challenging the health of the insurance companies. I think they've got their rates where they think they need them right now. I don't know if there's a case that would say that they're too high. I think the case wouldn't be say more so that they're too low. And I just don't see when the courts open up, you're going to see more unfortunately   losses that are just the current picks, while the best information they have right now are just too low. So I think there's not a case for cutting rates by any means. There's a case for continued increase in rates. And I just -- everything that we look at . There'll be interesting when other books get filed.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: This is not a hard market is, it was in the middle 80s where everything goes up, you know that work comp was flat, through most of this adjustment work comp is now up. As work comp comes up a little bit professional liability is going through the roof. Cyber is almost unbreakable. So you sit there and you look at this. These carriers are looking line by line, geography by geography and from our perspective, daily placing accounts, we are not seeing them lose discipline.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thanks for the answers. And congratulations on the quarter and the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: So my first question in the earnings release, there's comment that if the pace of economic recovery accelerates beyond your expectations, you could see expenses increase more than the current estimate. I just want to confirm or pick up that a little bit. Expenses may rise in that situation but wouldn't organic revenue also accelerate in that case? Essentially, what I'm trying to get at, margins don't get compressed with that, right?\nDoug Howell: But that's not a margin comment. That's just  comment.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And I guess all else equal, if the economy does accelerate beyond your expectations, margins, would margins actually come in better than expected?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: What we say that -- listen we think that there's a case that we can do better next year on organic than we have. We did this year if the economy accelerates exposure units grow the pent-up demand for goods and services increase, supply chains, get back to normal. Yes, your implication that question is right.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then in the CFO commentary, page three together, comment there on full year margins and brokerage being approximately 34%.? They were at 34% in '21, right at 33.9. So there should still be some upside to that. Is that just a rounding issue?\nDoug Howell: All right, thanks. First of all, said 34 is pretty darn good. I mean, when you look across the brokerage space, we're pretty proud of that margin and I have ever been here 18 plus years, it wasn't that way that that long ago. So you got to be pretty proud of that number compared to the industry. Second of all, yes, 34%. The reason why we don't round it even more is because we don't have a crystal ball. We also have FX adjustments that will come true. Yes, we could change that number slightly as with our international business over the next year. But what we're saying right there, just like we said in the commentary at 7%, we've got a decent chance of holding those margins we really think we do. At 8%, we could see a little bit more, over 8%, maybe a little more than that. So I wouldn't read a rounded 34% with all those factors as being an indicator that we're pegging exactly 33.9 like we have this year, but 34 is greater than 33.9. And then, when you roll in the reinsurance operations, you could get a little bit more left than that. So I would say would not read too terribly much into it.\nYaron Kinar: Okay, good. I'm glad that's confirmed. Finally, any update on Willis Re, the revenues and margin? I think the initial guidance you offered for '22 was still based on the 2020 numbers kind of used as a placeholder.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes. We feel really good about the team. We're onboard just over a little bit over a month, almost two months now. And as we said in our prepared remarks, the team's coming together extremely well. With a good strong January 1, and we brought $745 million of revenue and 265 million of EBITDAC, and that's still looking good.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from David Motemaden of Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Just a question on the brokerage organic in 2021 that 8%, wondering if you could just walk through the different drivers behind that in terms of exposure pricing, net new business, how much those contributed to that 8%. And how you see those elements shaping up in the 2022 outlook.\nDoug Howell: Okay. So first of all, let's break that down. There's the components of new lost opt-in, when customers opt-in for more coverages opt out when customers opt out because they want to control their budget for insurance spends and you got the impact of rate. So the fact is, is that we believe we're -- if you break that 8% down, let's just say that a third of it comes because we're just selling more business and we have before versus what we're losing. I think there's probably a third of that number that's coming from exposure, and a third of its coming from rate. So you've kind of got all three of them there. What's interesting on a multi-year impact is that customers can opt -- come up with -- we can help our customers come up with creative ways to mitigate the rate increases as their exposures grow, which we see is happening more and more over the next couple of years. It's harder to opt out of exposures. If you had 20 trucks and now you got to insure 22 of them. You can't just not insure two trucks. If you have a 20% increase in premiums, maybe you take a higher deductible, or you take less limits on it, and you can kind of opt out of the rate increases. But as we see exposure units fueling that organic growth going forward, top that off with rate increases that mix of -- I think would toggle probably more to exposure, more than net new wins and maybe less impact from rate as we continue to grow. As you push 10% of organic growth, it's going to be exposure unit driven.\nDavid Motemaden: Awesome, that's great color. Thanks for that. And I guess maybe just also Doug, you mentioned the cadence, maybe the first quarter being a little light. I don't want to get too granular here. It's a long year, but it sounded like that was really driven by employee benefits and workers comp and just seasonality there. But when I think about the 7% organic in employee benefits that seems pretty strong, definitely better than it was in December. Are you expecting a deceleration off of that up seven? And that's partially why maybe the first quarter would be a little bit lower than the full year? Or is it more workers comp driven?\nDoug Howell: Actually 7, if you pick, I'm just saying you have to make the pick. If you're picking 8%, next year 7, and I said it's about a point lower in the first quarter, that 7% is probably the number that you get to. If you pick 6%, I don't think that it would have that big of an impact on you. So what I said in my comments was about a point lower than the full year average. So that's what I would say it's just cautioning that business. doesn't grow as fast as our PNC right now.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay. That makes sense. And then if I could just sneak one more in, on the 4 billion of dry powder for M&A guys have over the next two years. Without issuing stock, that's a lot. It's a lot for tuck-ins. You mentioned earlier competition is also increasing. I guess I'm wondering if at some point, you would consider allocating some to capital return through share repurchases? Is that something that's come up at all, something that you think you might institute over the next year or two?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Absolutely, that's something if we have excess capital, we'll want to make sure that we maintain our solid investment grade rating, right? Absolutely, look at share repurchases and dividends.\nOperator: Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is related to clean energy. So Doug, I think you said that there's a chance that the laws could be extended, I just wanted to get a sense of the timing you thought there. And then, I thought in the past you guys had perhaps implied if you continue to be able to generate credits, you would not go the route of rolling out some kind of x amortization EPS. So are these now independent events. So meaning if you're able to generate more credits on the clean energy investments, you will still roll out some EPS estimate that is cash in nature and backs out intangibles, among other items.\nDoug Howell: I don't see us backing off of going towards that metric, regardless of what happens with an extension or not. So an answer to your question, we're going that route. We've done a lot of work on it. We think it's consistent with what other brokers are doing. And so we're pretty comfortable with going that route. What happens with an extension? I think it's going to be in the spring, we think that Congress has woken up to the fact that this technology provides a terrific benefit to our environment. So we hope that they see their way cleared, finding a spot and a bill to include it.\nElyse Greenspan: So if that does happen from a cash from a credit generating perspective and you would perhaps be unchecked, generate credits at a cadence that you were generating them at in 2021, just depending upon when you can get back on track with that?\nDoug Howell: You kind of broke up a little bit on that question. Can you just say it again, Elyse, sorry?\nElyse Greenspan: I was saying if you are able to regenerate credits from your clean energy investments this year, would you expect it to be at the same cadence that we saw in 2021?\nDoug Howell: Yes, I think so. I listen, we posted $97 million of after tax earnings on it. The pick would be 80 million more not 40, not 50. But there will be some plants that won't start up. They were planned to be decommissioned, made a whole location as being decommissioned. So I wouldn't see it as being as high as it was in. We had a terrific year, one of our best years ever and I just don't see that happening again, if it restarts. And clearly you'd have from the restart date to but if we don't get a -- if it's retroactive, these have been idled. They're sitting there. It's not like we can go back and produce credits in January, February and March but doesn't get passed until April.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then, with Willis Re in the M&A sheet, I saw that you guys put it in with the Q4 bucket. So I'm assuming based on the commentary is the embedded revenue from Willis Re just at that 745. And then if there's growth off of that, that would be additive to the M&A build. And then I'm assuming on a go forward basis, you'll just give us the revenue from Willis Re just on your quarterly calls like you did today?\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think let's make sure I can restate and go to page six of the CFO commentary we provided a grid that shows the fourth quarter acquisition activity. I would I understand your question there, how much of that line adds up and then subtract up to 745. And the 745 is in that line, including what other acquisitions we did during the fourth quarter for the vast majority of it. I'd have to do that add up while we're on the phone here.\nElyse Greenspan: No, that's fine. That's helpful. And then one last one on margin.\nDoug Howell: Let me restate that. We have a separate line for the reinsurance acquisition. I just didn't have my glasses on here. So we have other fourth quarter acquisitions in the line above it. So take a look at that.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, sorry. Thank you. And then the margin guide that you could see some expansion above 7%. I guess that was unchanged from December, right? So, we should expect if you're going to get to around 8% or so organic this coming year in brokerage, we should expect a modest level of margin expansion, correct, let me take all of your expense commentary throughout the call into account?\nDoug Howell: Yes, that would be what you would assume.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg Peters of Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: Great, thanks for allowing me to ask a follow up. I wanted to spend a minute and ask about your supplement and contingent line in the brokerage business. If the profitability of the carriers starts to improve, when we expect supplements and contingents to also grow maybe a little bit faster than just the base organic that you're expecting, or maybe more broadly, just one of the drivers of growth in supplements are contingents outside of acquisitions?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: The answer to your question is yes. And the driver is very simple, profitability on contingents, and revenue growth, premium growth on supplementals. And both of those should be impacted nicely by inflation, growing premiums and profitability.\nDoug Howell: And then, also they added value that we bring through our smart market through our advantage products, where we really can help match our customers need to the carrier's appetite for risk. We're getting continued momentum on that, Greg, you've been around a lot. And so it's -- we're continuing to add value in the relationship with our carriers. And they recognize it. So your statement, there is right. It should continue to grow as business becomes more positive, should all benefit from that.\nGreg Peters: I remember and this is dating me, but I remember when you started smart market. So I guess you since you brought it up, can you give us an update of how that business looks today versus where it was a year ago or two years ago? Whether it's in terms of number of clients, the amount of premium that it's accounting for or whatever metrics you're using?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, first of all, yeah, I can do that, Greg. The proof has been in the pudding with smart market. You were there when we started it. And to be perfectly blunt, there was some skepticism for all kinds of reasons around whether or not data and analytics being sold to insurance companies was really worth it. Okay, that question has been answered. It's very well accepted. It's now being utilized in RPS been utilized across our Gallagher global brokerage operation, including locations outside the United States, Canada, and U.K., et cetera. So it's getting very broad recepients across more than probably 15 to 20 carriers today.\nDoug Howell: Yes. Think about when we think back to our IR days that we talked about. Here we speak not mostly about our -- initially about our U.S. business and the things that we've done in our U.S. business and in terms of carrier relations in terms of our core 360 platform, our use of offshore centers of excellence. And then, how we're bringing that to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. retail, now into some of the other retail locations as we take minority positions perhaps in Europe. This is an example of how a seed planted and developed here in the U.S. can be spread around the world and vice versa. There are techniques around the world that we bring back to the U.S. So, Greg, you're right at the  , yes, this is something we're proving out and rolling out around the world. And that's why when we talk about retail around the world, it all looks the same with different nuances by country.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: And it's been very, very good for our people to tie closer to the insurance companies and we're generating about $25 million of income from that. So it's been a win-win for everybody.\nGreg Peters: Great, thank you. Thanks for the color there. I guess the last question I would have, Doug, I've used your quote before about in reference to margins. I think you previously had said on a conference call, well, trees don't grow to the moon. So you guys have a 34% in on rounding up, EBITDAC margin in your brokerage business. When do we begin to top out? I mean, everyone's reporting margin expansion, at some point, you're going to -- you would think that there might be some downward pressure on fees or commissions or something that might cause some downward pressure on margins?\nDoug Howell: Well, I think there's a difference between non-discretionary margin expansion and discretionary margin contraction. I think that scale has its advantages, there are limits to scale and all the product of organic, I think, just  would be very happy if we can somehow post 9% organic growth for the rest of our lives and have just incremental margins. And that's a pretty good story.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Right. It's just it's not about talking margin strategy, acquisition strategy. You are right. They don't grow to the moon and more importantly, what does the client demands from us that require us to continue to make investments. It's not there and 100% yet, but clients are becoming more demanding. And in order for us to compete in post that stellar organic growth, we need to make investments in the business. So I don't have an answer for you. But when we do, we will announce.\nGreg Peters: Well, I like the idea of putting 9% organic and margin expansion in my model for the next five years, so go get them Tiger.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Hughes of Truist.\nMark Hughes: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Quick question in the risk management business, what's your latest view on kind of broader outsourcing trends among the major PNC players, the potential shifts to using third parties like your risk management operation to do that in a more comprehensive way, just a quick update would be interesting. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, thanks for the question, Mark. This is Pat. I think you're going to see a continued move in that direction. It's been going on now for almost a decade. I don't think it's any secret that we've been at the forefront of that. Starting literally before the Chubb ACE combination, we were doing work on behalf of Chubb and their risk management portfolio. Prior to that, in fact, we were doing all the outsourced service for Arch as they began their program of growth in the United States. And right now, the outsourced work that we do for insurance companies is a very big part of Gallagher Bassets revenues. And I would say it's probably our largest opportunity, looking at the future over the next five to 10 years. There are some very substantial companies, I can\u2019t name them, you understand that. That are seriously looking at this. And quite honestly, it makes a heck of a lot of sense. We've got trading partners that when I mentioned to them that Gallagher Bassett pays more claims than you do. And again, I can't mention names. They go, no, you don't. I actually we do. And I'll bet you we invest twice as much in data and analytics. And then, in our Willis systems than you do, no you don\u2019t. Well, we will actually stand toe to toe with you and show you that. But that ends up driving is the ability we believe to prove that our outcomes are superior. And those superior outcomes come from all kinds of advantages. Both of scale but also have expertise. And once you start talking to management at these insurance companies about the fact that you've got pent-up return on investment, you've got ROE opportunities and we can do that. I honestly believe that there will come a day when people ask why did insurance companies pay their own claims?\nOperator: Our final question comes from Derek Han of KBW.\nDerek Han: Your comp ratio is quite good in the quarter, which kind of been a threat from some of the actions you've taken in 2020. But I was hoping that you could kind of talk about how wage inflation is impacting that number. And just curious if you know, the impact is more pronounced among producers that you're trying to hire versus the support staff?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, one of the things I'm very proud of Derek is, we are one of the -- we're probably the only significant broker that still is very comfortable paying our producers on a formula that pays them a percentage of their book. And that's very competitive with the local brokerage community. So think about it this way. Where do you want to sell from what platform, a platform that gives you the kind of data and analytics that we've got that has the relationships that we've got, that has the global reach that we've got? Or what would you like to do it from the Jones agency in Alsip, Illinois, hope there isn't one there. But the fact is, we're happy to have you come aboard and pay you a percentage. So really, a big part of our benefits and comp expense for producers is self-generated and self-regulated.\nDoug Howell: And our middle office layer and our back office layer, as you know, we've made substantial investments in standardizing our process and using our offshore centers of excellence. As a result of that, 17 years ago, we made a decision that we could raise our quality and reduce our costs. And it's actually helping us a little bit of an inflation hedge. I'll tell you, we've been taking care of our employees. We gave a sizable raise pool this year. We gave raises even in the depths of the pandemic. Bonuses, we've been fair, these people have earned them, they've earned their raises. The raises are not as a result of -- because of we feel like we've got to hold our people, our culture holds our people. The raise is what recognize their contribution to what we've been doing. So Deming said the best is you can't have low cost without high quality. And we've worked for years on raising our quality and it's reducing our costs. It's also making our folks more effective. We have 20,000 people that do service plus another 6000 in India that get up every day and want to do a great job for our clients. So we pay them well. Our retention is as good today as it was pre-pandemic. So I think that our workforce is well-positioned for right now. So we're proud of our workforce and we've recognized our workforce and I think they deserve to be recognized on that. And despite that our volumes are helping us, and our scales helping us, our technologies are helping us, control press the numbers but those people that are here get paid very well.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, also you've heard now everywhere agile work, agile work, work from home. We've been agile and how we work with our workforce for the last 25 years. So pre-pandemic probably 50% of Gallagher Bassett's entire field force was at home. So, this is not new territory for us. We listen to the employees. We want people to stick around. As Doug said, our retention rates and our turnaround rates are no different than they were pre-pandemic. So the great recognition hasn\u2019t hit Gallagher yet.\nDerek Han: Okay. That\u2019s really, really helpful. Thank you. And just going back to your expectations on the brokerage organic growth of 8% plus. Are you embedding any kind of slowdown from potential rate hikes or maybe kind of beating supply chain constraints or maybe labor constraints? I know you sounded very confident about achieving that. But kind of wanted to get a sense of what could real the percent plus organic growth.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m too much of an optimist. But I look at the stimulus bill is coming out of Washington DC. The kind of money that\u2019s going to flow into infrastructure. Every contractor and our book of business is going to be loaded up with work. Every single personal lines account all the way through small commercial, it\u2019s a large commercial has got significant increases that they need in their -- in the cost of their property portfolio. Payrolls are up as you mentioned earlier Derek from just the whole employment situation and all of that. There is not an industry that I can think of that benefits more than the insurance brokerage business from a nice little touch of inflation. Hold all tickets.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, thanks everybody. I appreciate you being here today. Thanks for joining us. As you all know we delivered an excellent fourth quarter and full year 2021. I would like to thank our colleagues around the globe for such an outstanding year. Our results were direct reflection of their efforts. We look forward to speak with you again in our March Investor Meeting. And have a good evening. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a great evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Doug Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat. And hello, everyone. As Pat said a terrific quarter to close out in an outstanding year. Today, I'll start with our earnings release and touch on organic margins and our corporate segment shortcut table. Then I'll move to our CFO commentary document where there I'll talk a little bit about how we're now providing our their typical modeling helpers for '22, add some commentary in the Willis Re acquisition and our latest thinking on clean energy. I'll then finish up with my comments on cash liquidity and capital management. Okay, let's flip the page for the earnings release to the brokerage segment, organic table. All in brokerage organic was 10.6% a nice step up from the 9% we posted last. And the six plus percent we posted in the first half of '21 leading to full year organic of 8%. Looking forward as Pat said, we see full year '22 similar to '21 or even better. Now turn to page six for the brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Headline all in adjusted margin expansion for fourth quarter was 13 basis points right in line with our December IRD expectation. But recall that expansion has the adverse seasonal impact of closing Willis Re on December 1. Without that, adjusted margins would have expanded 88 basis points also right in line with the forecast we provided in December. For full year adjusted margin expansion was 123 basis points. Excluding Willis Re, it was up 142 basis points. And it's important not to forget, that's on top of 420 basis points of adjusted margin expansion in '20 and 75 basis points in '19. That's absolutely incredible execution before during and as we emerge from the pandemic. Moving on from '21. Looking forward, as the pandemic limitations continue to ease in '22, we will naturally see some costs returning in areas such as travel, entertainment and perhaps some other office consumables. Incremental full year '22 costs from these three areas could be as much as 25 million. But even then, our full year spend on these categories would be below pre-pandemic levels, showing that we're holding safe. Also, we're back to making targeted investments to drive long-term growth. In '22, we're planning for increases in marketing, advertising, consulting, professional fees and certain IT investments. These costs combined with higher insurance premiums say for E&O, D&O and work comp would total around 35 million. So like we said in our December IR Day, we should be able to absorb those costs and hold margins if we post around 7% organic. And if organic is over 7% even show some margin expansion. Then by 2023, we could be back to that pre-pandemic view that margin expansion might occur at a 4% or so organic level. And to be clear, all of these comments are before the impact of the acquisition of Willis Re. On a pro forma basis, those margins can run a bit higher. So math would say would naturally provide some lift to our consolidated brokerage segment margins in '22. A couple of things to keep in mind as you build your quarterly models for our brokerage segment in 2022. First consider seasonality, due to our benefits business, and now our larger reinsurance business, first quarter seasonality, our first quarter is our largest revenue in EBITDAC of the quarter of the year. And second perhaps slightly more nuanced, since we're not seeing price and or exposure increases in benefits and workers comp to the extent we are in other areas of PNC insurance. First quarter organic might be a point or so below your full year pick simply due to the mix. So the math would then suggest their second, third and fourth quarters could post over your full year organic pick. Again, that's just a nuance to help you with your quarterly model. Moving on to the risk management segment and the organic table at the bottom of Page Six, you'll see 13.1% organic in the fourth quarter and full year organic in excess of 12%. What a great rebound from the depths of the pandemic. And as Pat said, it's looking like revenue momentum continues into '22 with full year organic revenue growth in the high single digits, which is really terrific given '22 will naturally have more difficult compares than '21. Moving to the risk management segment EBITDAC table on page seven. Adjusted EBITDAC margin of 18.6% in the quarter and more than 19% for the full year, a fantastic result. And just like our brokerage segment, a nice step up from pre-pandemic levels of 17.5%. Again, that demonstrates our ability to maintain a portion of our pandemic period savings even as we make some further investment in technology investments. Looking forward, as you heard on our December IR Day, we will continue to make investments in analytics and tools to enhance the client experience and drive better claim outcomes. But even with those holding margins close to that 19% is achievable for full year \u201822. All right, let's turn to page eight to the corporate segment table. In total, adjusted results $0.02 better than the midpoint of our December IR Day forecast, mostly as a result of strong clean energy earnings. We did have a couple of notable adjustments this quarter. First Willis Re transaction related costs, as discussed in footnote two were 22 million after tax. And second, as discussed in footnote three and similar to third quarter, we had non-cash, deferred tax adjustments related to international M&A earnouts, which is the most of it as well as some other small tax and legal settlement items together about 19 million after tax. Now let's shift to our CFO commentary document we post on our website starting with page three. As for fourth quarter, you'll see most of the brokerage and risk management items are close to our December IR Day estimates. Also on that page, we are now providing our first look at items related to the brokerage and risk management segment. A couple lines we're highlighting, first FX, the late '21 and early '22 weakening of the U.S. dollar against our major currencies is creating about a $0.04 headwind to EPS next year. Second integration costs. You'll read in footnote one, the integration estimates provided here only reflect expense associated with Willis Re. As Pat mentioned, integration is well underway and we are still comfortable with our ultimate pack of about $250 million of total costs for integration. All right, let's turn to page five of the CFO commentary, the page addressing clean energy. The purpose of this page is to highlight we are transitioning from over a decade of showing GAAP earnings to a six-day period where we harvest cash flows. You'll see in the blue column that we reported '21 GAAP earnings of 97.4 million, a really nice step up, up 39% over '20 and we generated 40 million of net after tax cash flow. So also a nice step up from '20. But the real headline story here is in the pinkish column. Cash flows take a significant step up in '22, looks like we'll be harvesting $125 million to $150 million a year of cash flows and perhaps even more in '23 and beyond. Now there is still a possibility of an extension in the law and we're well positioned to restart production if that happens, but if not, we have over a billion dollars of credit carryovers. If we use say $150 million a year that's a seven year cash flow sweetener. Flipping to page six in the rollover revenue table. The reinsurance acquisition is off to a solid start and we are encouraged with both its December results and early indications from the 1-1 renewal season. So it's looking like our pro forma revenue and EBITDAC of 745 million and 265 million respectively, are holding up nicely. So the reinsurance acquisition is off to a terrific start. All right, as for the cash and capital management future M&A. At December 31, available cash on hand is about 300 million with strong operating cash flows expected in '22. And potentially a nice pumping cash flow from our clean energy investments, we are extremely well positioned to fund future tuck-in M&A using cash and debt. Over the next two years, we could do over $4 billion of M&A without using any stock. You also see that our Board of Directors announced a $0.03 per share increase to our quarterly dividend, that would imply an annual payout of $2.04 per share. That's a 6.3% increase over 2021. Finally, one calendar item, we are planning on our regular mid quarter IR Day from 8 am to 10 am, Central Time on March 16. Again, that will most likely be virtual. During that we will allocate some time to socialize our planned migration to reporting adjusted GAAP EPS results excluding the impact of non-cash intangible asset amortization. We'll discuss the detail of all the adjustments including representing historical results on the new basis. Okay, that's it. From my vantage point, as CFO we are extremely well positioned for another great year here in '22. Before I turn it back over to you, Pat, I'd like to thank the entire Gallagher team for a terrific quarter and fantastic year. Pat? I still think there's a lot of pent-up exposure unit growth that still to come. We think there's inflation sitting there. We think that there's a need for our benefit consulting advice, more and more. We think that wholesaling markets are becoming tough and harder to find placements. We think there are more accelerators when it comes to that then there are maybe a slight, 0.5 point pullback in what the underwriters are asking for in re that far overshadows it. Obviously, I don't know. I couldn't. In terms of the multiple Greg. Yes, the multiples ticked up a little bit, not as much as what our multiple has. So there's still a terrific arbitrage there. But also, you have to realize the growth rates that drive those multiples have gone up quite a bit, too. So I think there's justification for higher multiples. But we're still buying in that eight to 10 range when it comes to tuck-in acquisition. It's a pretty good run rate versus our trading multiple of 15, 16, 17. I think, Greg, there's also some things, x cat, x reserve releases, I think, and then the prospect of just inflation just have a reserve be coming in, let's say just 10% more than what the original estimate was. That's a huge difference on a combined ratio. So I think that the -- I'm not challenging the health of the insurance companies. I think they've got their rates where they think they need them right now. I don't know if there's a case that would say that they're too high. I think the case wouldn't be say more so that they're too low. And I just don't see when the courts open up, you're going to see more unfortunately   losses that are just the current picks, while the best information they have right now are just too low. So I think there's not a case for cutting rates by any means. There's a case for continued increase in rates. And I just -- everything that we look at . There'll be interesting when other books get filed. But that's not a margin comment. That's just  comment. All right, thanks. First of all, said 34 is pretty darn good. I mean, when you look across the brokerage space, we're pretty proud of that margin and I have ever been here 18 plus years, it wasn't that way that that long ago. So you got to be pretty proud of that number compared to the industry. Second of all, yes, 34%. The reason why we don't round it even more is because we don't have a crystal ball. We also have FX adjustments that will come true. Yes, we could change that number slightly as with our international business over the next year. But what we're saying right there, just like we said in the commentary at 7%, we've got a decent chance of holding those margins we really think we do. At 8%, we could see a little bit more, over 8%, maybe a little more than that. So I wouldn't read a rounded 34% with all those factors as being an indicator that we're pegging exactly 33.9 like we have this year, but 34 is greater than 33.9. And then, when you roll in the reinsurance operations, you could get a little bit more left than that. So I would say would not read too terribly much into it. Okay. So first of all, let's break that down. There's the components of new lost opt-in, when customers opt-in for more coverages opt out when customers opt out because they want to control their budget for insurance spends and you got the impact of rate. So the fact is, is that we believe we're -- if you break that 8% down, let's just say that a third of it comes because we're just selling more business and we have before versus what we're losing. I think there's probably a third of that number that's coming from exposure, and a third of its coming from rate. So you've kind of got all three of them there. What's interesting on a multi-year impact is that customers can opt -- come up with -- we can help our customers come up with creative ways to mitigate the rate increases as their exposures grow, which we see is happening more and more over the next couple of years. It's harder to opt out of exposures. If you had 20 trucks and now you got to insure 22 of them. You can't just not insure two trucks. If you have a 20% increase in premiums, maybe you take a higher deductible, or you take less limits on it, and you can kind of opt out of the rate increases. But as we see exposure units fueling that organic growth going forward, top that off with rate increases that mix of -- I think would toggle probably more to exposure, more than net new wins and maybe less impact from rate as we continue to grow. As you push 10% of organic growth, it's going to be exposure unit driven. Actually 7, if you pick, I'm just saying you have to make the pick. If you're picking 8%, next year 7, and I said it's about a point lower in the first quarter, that 7% is probably the number that you get to. If you pick 6%, I don't think that it would have that big of an impact on you. So what I said in my comments was about a point lower than the full year average. So that's what I would say it's just cautioning that business. doesn't grow as fast as our PNC right now. I don't see us backing off of going towards that metric, regardless of what happens with an extension or not. So an answer to your question, we're going that route. We've done a lot of work on it. We think it's consistent with what other brokers are doing. And so we're pretty comfortable with going that route. What happens with an extension? I think it's going to be in the spring, we think that Congress has woken up to the fact that this technology provides a terrific benefit to our environment. So we hope that they see their way cleared, finding a spot and a bill to include it. You kind of broke up a little bit on that question. Can you just say it again, Elyse, sorry? Yes, I think so. I listen, we posted $97 million of after tax earnings on it. The pick would be 80 million more not 40, not 50. But there will be some plants that won't start up. They were planned to be decommissioned, made a whole location as being decommissioned. So I wouldn't see it as being as high as it was in. We had a terrific year, one of our best years ever and I just don't see that happening again, if it restarts. And clearly you'd have from the restart date to but if we don't get a -- if it's retroactive, these have been idled. They're sitting there. It's not like we can go back and produce credits in January, February and March but doesn't get passed until April. Yes. I think let's make sure I can restate and go to page six of the CFO commentary we provided a grid that shows the fourth quarter acquisition activity. I would I understand your question there, how much of that line adds up and then subtract up to 745. And the 745 is in that line, including what other acquisitions we did during the fourth quarter for the vast majority of it. I'd have to do that add up while we're on the phone here. Let me restate that. We have a separate line for the reinsurance acquisition. I just didn't have my glasses on here. So we have other fourth quarter acquisitions in the line above it. So take a look at that. Yes, that would be what you would assume. And then, also they added value that we bring through our smart market through our advantage products, where we really can help match our customers need to the carrier's appetite for risk. We're getting continued momentum on that, Greg, you've been around a lot. And so it's -- we're continuing to add value in the relationship with our carriers. And they recognize it. So your statement, there is right. It should continue to grow as business becomes more positive, should all benefit from that. Yes. Think about when we think back to our IR days that we talked about. Here we speak not mostly about our -- initially about our U.S. business and the things that we've done in our U.S. business and in terms of carrier relations in terms of our core 360 platform, our use of offshore centers of excellence. And then, how we're bringing that to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the U.K. retail, now into some of the other retail locations as we take minority positions perhaps in Europe. This is an example of how a seed planted and developed here in the U.S. can be spread around the world and vice versa. There are techniques around the world that we bring back to the U.S. So, Greg, you're right at the  , yes, this is something we're proving out and rolling out around the world. And that's why when we talk about retail around the world, it all looks the same with different nuances by country. Well, I think there's a difference between non-discretionary margin expansion and discretionary margin contraction. I think that scale has its advantages, there are limits to scale and all the product of organic, I think, just  would be very happy if we can somehow post 9% organic growth for the rest of our lives and have just incremental margins. And that's a pretty good story. And our middle office layer and our back office layer, as you know, we've made substantial investments in standardizing our process and using our offshore centers of excellence. As a result of that, 17 years ago, we made a decision that we could raise our quality and reduce our costs. And it's actually helping us a little bit of an inflation hedge. I'll tell you, we've been taking care of our employees. We gave a sizable raise pool this year. We gave raises even in the depths of the pandemic. Bonuses, we've been fair, these people have earned them, they've earned their raises. The raises are not as a result of -- because of we feel like we've got to hold our people, our culture holds our people. The raise is what recognize their contribution to what we've been doing. So Deming said the best is you can't have low cost without high quality. And we've worked for years on raising our quality and it's reducing our costs. It's also making our folks more effective. We have 20,000 people that do service plus another 6000 in India that get up every day and want to do a great job for our clients. So we pay them well. Our retention is as good today as it was pre-pandemic. So I think that our workforce is well-positioned for right now. So we're proud of our workforce and we've recognized our workforce and I think they deserve to be recognized on that. And despite that our volumes are helping us, and our scales helping us, our technologies are helping us, control press the numbers but those people that are here get paid very well."

            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had an outstanding fourth quarter. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments, we posted 18% growth in revenue, 11% organic growth, net earnings growth of 11% adjusted EBITDAC growth of 17% and we completed 18 new tuck-in mergers in the quarter. That's on top of closing our Willis Re merger. Our total for the year, our merger strategy added more than $1 billion of annualized revenue. That's just fantastic. Needless to say, I'm extremely proud of how the team performed during the fourth quarter and the full year. So let me give you some more detail on our outstanding fourth quarter performance starting with the brokerage segment. During the quarter reported revenue growth was an excellent 19% of that 10.6 was organic, another sequential step up from the third quarter and the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement. Net earnings growth was 8% adjusted EBITDAC growth was 17%. And we expanded our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 13 basis points in line with our December IRD expectations. Remember, that's lower because of the natural seasonality of the reinsurance acquisition, margins would have expanded nearly 90 basis points. So another great quarter for the brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and break down the 10.6% organic, starting with our PC operations. First, a domestic retail business posted 13% of organic, driven by excellent new business, higher exposures and continued rate increases. Risk placement services, our domestic wholesale operations posted organic of 15%. This includes more than 30% organic in open brokerage, and 5% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business was better than 2020 levels and near double-digit renewal premium increases helped to. Outside the U.S., our U.K. business posted organic of 12% specialty including our existing Gallagher Re business was up in the high teens and retail is up 7% Both fueled by new business and retention in excess of 2020 levels. Australia, New Zealand combined, organic was more than 8% also benefiting from good new business and improved retention. And finally, Canada was up more than 13% organically and continues to benefit from strong new business trends, stable retention and renewal premium increases. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Fourth quarter organic was up about 7% a couple of points better than our December IRD expectation. We saw some nice sequential improvement over the course of 2021 up from the 2% organic we delivered in the first quarter, thanks to a rebound in global economy, declining U.S. unemployment and increased demand for our consulting services as businesses look to grow. Next I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market. Overall, global fourth quarter renewal premium increases were above 8% broadly consistent with the increases we saw during the first three quarters of '21. Moving around the world renewal premium change which includes both rates and exposure, up about 8.5% in U.S. retail including a 13% increase in professional liability, 8% in property and casualty and 4% in workers comp. In Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.K., retail renewal premiums up between 7% and 9%, mostly driven by increases in professional liability and property. Within RPS, wholesale open brokerage premium increases were up 13% and binding operations were up six. Shifting to reinsurance, January 1 renewal showed price increases that vary by geography and client loss experience, loss free programs saw rates flattish to up 10%. While loss impacted accounts and cat exposed property business experienced rate increases that were in many cases double that. So rate tended to be based on client's specific attributes and loss history. And I consider that to be a healthy outcome. So whether retail, wholesale or reinsurance premiums are still increasing almost everywhere. Looking forward, I see a difficult PC market conditions continuing throughout 2022. That's because our risk bearing partners remain cautious on rising loss costs. So property coverages replacement cost inflation and the increased frequency and severity of catastrophe losses are causing underwriters to rethink rate adequacy. On the casualty side, social inflation, low investment returns and the potential for increases in claim frequency as global economies further recover are all potential negative drivers of future underwriting profitability. And on top of higher loss costs and lower investment insurance, reinsurance costs are also increasing. So I think carriers will continue to push for rate and don't see a dramatic change in the near term. We shine in this type of environment by helping our clients find appropriate coverage while mitigating price increases throughout creativity, expertise and market relationships. I'm equally as upbeat on our employee benefit consulting and brokerage business. As you know the first quarter seasonally our largest employee benefits quarter and is looking like the team had a strong annual enrollment season. Early indications are pointing to an increase in new client wins over prior year, consistent client retention and a slight increase in covered lives. With improved business activity and increased demand for goods and services businesses are trying to grow their workforce. But the labor market remains extremely tight with more than 10.5 million job openings domestically and 6.3 million people unemployed and looking for work. This lays the groundwork for robust demand for our consulting services in 2022 as employers look to attract, retain and motivate their workforce. So we finished '21 with full year organic of 8%. That's really nice improvement from the 3.2% organic we reported in '20 and above pre-pandemic 2019 organic of 5.8%. And as we sit here today, we think '22 organic will end up in a very similar range to '21 and there is a case that it ends up even better. Let me move on to mergers and acquisitions. It was great work by the team to close the reinsurance acquisition in early December. Integration is well under way and progressing at a good pace. Remember, we are a seasoned integrator. On the revenue side, much like our tuck-in acquisitions, we've mobilized our local teams from retail, wholesale and even Gallagher Bassett to partner with our new colleagues and generate new revenue opportunities. I'm also very pleased that our combined Gallagher Re team hit the ground running and had a strong finish to the year. Financially, the acquisition added about 20 million of revenue in December and as expected generated a small EBITDAC loss due to seasonality. More importantly, I'm already seeing examples of cross division cooperation and collaboration. So our new reinsurance colleagues are quickly embracing our Better Together Gallagher culture. Outside of reinsurance, we completed 18 tuck-in brokerage mergers during the quarter, representing about $65 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have around 35 term sheets signed are being prepared representing over $200 million of annualized revenues. We know all these will not close however, we believe we'll get our fair share. Next, I'd like to move to our risk management segment Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic was 13.1% a bit better than our December IRD expectation, margins approached 19% in the quarter, leading to full year adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.1%. Another great quarter and full year for that matter from the team. We saw more new arising claims within General Liability and Property and to a lesser extent co-workers compensation during the quarter. New COVID related workers comp claims were similar to the third quarter dated slightly by the late year surge in cases from Omicron variant. Regardless of the short-term variability of new rising claim activity, we feel really good about the business. Looking forward continued strong retention, combined with new client wins in the fourth quarter should drive '22 organic into the high single digit range. So it was another fantastic year for our franchise and I'm extremely proud of our team and our collective accomplishments. Together, we produced 8.6% organic growth in our combined brokerage and risk management segments, completed 38 mergers with more than $1 billion of estimated annualized revenue, more than 110 basis points of adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion. And we were recognized as one of the world's most ethical companies for the 10th year in a row by the Ethisphere Institute and all this in the face of a pandemic. What a fantastic year, more than ever, our success is due to our bedrock culture. Our culture helps us deliver better results, better results for all of our stakeholders, including our customers, our colleagues, our underwriting partners, and of course, our shareholders. Every day, all of our teammates get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture and to live our culture. That truly is the Gallagher way. Okay, I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thanks, Doug. Operator, let's go to questions and answers please. We think that the rates are going to hold. It's just that simple. market falls out. They won't, market holds the way it is, it will. I'd see all kinds of reasons for it to continue, as laid out in my prepared remarks. But beyond that, you've got a situation where underwriters are not backing off from their need for rate. We're seeing that every single day. We're into the renewals, obviously now deep into the first quarter. And we're not seeing rate relief in any way, shape or form along the lines of what I talked about in my remarks. Of course, I said we think we have 4 billion to spend over the next couple of years. I think that's almost 2 billion next year and a little over 2 billion in the final year. So we have plenty of free cash to fund acquisition our pipeline. It does get a little slower in the first quarter. There's people that push more to have something done by year end and we have that happen every year. But we're pretty excited about what we're seeing in our pipeline right now. Pre-pandemic, Pre-pandemic. Yes, great. Let me take the first part of your question. When we get to an actual term sheet, we're usually moving down, especially in our tuck-ins, we're usually moving down a path where we're going to do a deal. And one of the things about our reputation is that we will close. Having said that, over the last two to three years, there's considerably more competition, you can take a $5 million deal today and if it's going to get spreadsheet, there'll be a dozen, really thinking of a dozen bids. So we are really trying hard to make sure that all of our new partners are excited about what the future provides being part of Gallagher, which quite honestly, we think is substantially better and more exciting than our private equity competitors. But that doesn't diminish the fact that they're good competitors and they're smart people. And they're well funded. So I don't have a number for you specifically, I can't say, oh, yeah, we closed 32% of the ones that we finally get to. We don't keep the records that way. I don't do that. But anecdotally, I'll tell you that we should close more than half of the ones that we get to we have a signed term sheet, while I will take it back, we should close 90% of the ones where we have a signed term sheet, 10% will slip out of the net. And where we're preparing term sheets, we should close about half of those. Well, Greg, this is Pat. Normally for 20 years, and there's never been a time in that period where I've been as bullish as I am today. I mean, everything, everything is going our way. So let me try not to spend 20 minutes answering your question here. But let's start with the fact that we've never been stronger. Vertical capabilities are absolutely critical. Data and analytics are absolutely critical. When you take a look at the volumes that we now have that we can do the data and analytics around we can tell you what's happening by day with rates and renewals or what have you. 10 years ago, we flew blind totally on that customer asked why do I have even know I've got a good deal with the rate environment going like it is. We can show them what's happening to the rates by line, by geography and why they have a good deal. And that type of question is getting asked right into the middle market. And over 90% of the time when we compete, we compete with a smaller competitor. That's why these people are selling to private equity. That's why these roll ups are working. And I'm telling you it's unbelievable the opportunity we have right now. So I see this is the greatest buying opportunity in the last five years. Well, let's start with inflation. You've done all your actuarial work at a 2% inflation rate. And now it's six. Oh, yeah, that was a blip on the radar, was going to be gone by now. I guess that's not going to happen. Secondly, let's look at last costs. What does it cost to build a house today? Well, we got it done for $200 a square foot a few years ago, certainly isn't that now. And I could go on and on and on. I mean, the level of nuclear, the number of nuclear settlements. The other thing too is, I've been saying this now for years, I think it's more true than ever. Our underwriters or our underwriting partners are very, very smart. And they've got incredible data and analytic skills. They know where they're making money in that 88% everywhere around the world every day and they know where they're not making money. And you walk in and start talking about a deal that you want to broker, it's something that's going to be substantially less than they know, they'll get or deserve. They're just not buying it. This is not a hard market is, it was in the middle 80s where everything goes up, you know that work comp was flat, through most of this adjustment work comp is now up. As work comp comes up a little bit professional liability is going through the roof. Cyber is almost unbreakable. So you sit there and you look at this. These carriers are looking line by line, geography by geography and from our perspective, daily placing accounts, we are not seeing them lose discipline. What we say that -- listen we think that there's a case that we can do better next year on organic than we have. We did this year if the economy accelerates exposure units grow the pent-up demand for goods and services increase, supply chains, get back to normal. Yes, your implication that question is right. Yes. We feel really good about the team. We're onboard just over a little bit over a month, almost two months now. And as we said in our prepared remarks, the team's coming together extremely well. With a good strong January 1, and we brought $745 million of revenue and 265 million of EBITDAC, and that's still looking good. Absolutely, that's something if we have excess capital, we'll want to make sure that we maintain our solid investment grade rating, right? Absolutely, look at share repurchases and dividends. The answer to your question is yes. And the driver is very simple, profitability on contingents, and revenue growth, premium growth on supplementals. And both of those should be impacted nicely by inflation, growing premiums and profitability. Well, first of all, yeah, I can do that, Greg. The proof has been in the pudding with smart market. You were there when we started it. And to be perfectly blunt, there was some skepticism for all kinds of reasons around whether or not data and analytics being sold to insurance companies was really worth it. Okay, that question has been answered. It's very well accepted. It's now being utilized in RPS been utilized across our Gallagher global brokerage operation, including locations outside the United States, Canada, and U.K., et cetera. So it's getting very broad recepients across more than probably 15 to 20 carriers today. And it's been very, very good for our people to tie closer to the insurance companies and we're generating about $25 million of income from that. So it's been a win-win for everybody. Right. It's just it's not about talking margin strategy, acquisition strategy. You are right. They don't grow to the moon and more importantly, what does the client demands from us that require us to continue to make investments. It's not there and 100% yet, but clients are becoming more demanding. And in order for us to compete in post that stellar organic growth, we need to make investments in the business. So I don't have an answer for you. But when we do, we will announce. Well, thanks for the question, Mark. This is Pat. I think you're going to see a continued move in that direction. It's been going on now for almost a decade. I don't think it's any secret that we've been at the forefront of that. Starting literally before the Chubb ACE combination, we were doing work on behalf of Chubb and their risk management portfolio. Prior to that, in fact, we were doing all the outsourced service for Arch as they began their program of growth in the United States. And right now, the outsourced work that we do for insurance companies is a very big part of Gallagher Bassets revenues. And I would say it's probably our largest opportunity, looking at the future over the next five to 10 years. There are some very substantial companies, I can't name them, you understand that. That are seriously looking at this. And quite honestly, it makes a heck of a lot of sense. We've got trading partners that when I mentioned to them that Gallagher Bassett pays more claims than you do. And again, I can't mention names. They go, no, you don't. I actually we do. And I'll bet you we invest twice as much in data and analytics. And then, in our Willis systems than you do, no you don't. Well, we will actually stand toe to toe with you and show you that. But that ends up driving is the ability we believe to prove that our outcomes are superior. And those superior outcomes come from all kinds of advantages. Both of scale but also have expertise. And once you start talking to management at these insurance companies about the fact that you've got pent-up return on investment, you've got ROE opportunities and we can do that. I honestly believe that there will come a day when people ask why did insurance companies pay their own claims? Well, one of the things I'm very proud of Derek is, we are one of the -- we're probably the only significant broker that still is very comfortable paying our producers on a formula that pays them a percentage of their book. And that's very competitive with the local brokerage community. So think about it this way. Where do you want to sell from what platform, a platform that gives you the kind of data and analytics that we've got that has the relationships that we've got, that has the global reach that we've got? Or what would you like to do it from the Jones agency in Alsip, Illinois, hope there isn't one there. But the fact is, we're happy to have you come aboard and pay you a percentage. So really, a big part of our benefits and comp expense for producers is self-generated and self-regulated. Well, also you've heard now everywhere agile work, agile work, work from home. We've been agile and how we work with our workforce for the last 25 years. So pre-pandemic probably 50% of Gallagher Bassett's entire field force was at home. So, this is not new territory for us. We listen to the employees. We want people to stick around. As Doug said, our retention rates and our turnaround rates are no different than they were pre-pandemic. So the great recognition hasn't hit Gallagher yet. I'm sorry, I'm too much of an optimist. But I look at the stimulus bill is coming out of Washington DC. The kind of money that's going to flow into infrastructure. Every contractor and our book of business is going to be loaded up with work. Every single personal lines account all the way through small commercial, it's a large commercial has got significant increases that they need in their -- in the cost of their property portfolio. Payrolls are up as you mentioned earlier Derek from just the whole employment situation and all of that. There is not an industry that I can think of that benefits more than the insurance brokerage business from a nice little touch of inflation. Hold all tickets. Well, thanks everybody. I appreciate you being here today. Thanks for joining us. As you all know we delivered an excellent fourth quarter and full year 2021. I would like to thank our colleagues around the globe for such an outstanding year. Our results were direct reflection of their efforts. We look forward to speak with you again in our March Investor Meeting. And have a good evening. Thank you very much."

It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had a fantastic third quarter. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments we posted 17% growth in revenue, 10% organic growth and nearly 11% organic, if you control for last year's large life sale that we've discussed frequently. Net earnings growth of 22%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and we completed five new mergers in the quarter bringing our year-to-date closed merger counts in 19 representing nearly $200 million of annualized revenue. And if you add in the pending Willis Reinsurance merger, that number would be pushing $1 billion. So the team continues to execute at a very high level, growing organically, growing through acquisitions, improving our productivity, raising our quality, and most importantly, constantly building upon our unique Gallagher culture, a terrific quarter on all measures. Let me provide a brief update on our agreement to purchase Willis Re. On the regulatory approval front, we received competition clearance in five or six jurisdictions required to close, including clearance by the U.S. Department of Justice. The final jurisdiction in the UK, where the CMA is reviewing the transaction, that's the final jurisdiction. That review is ongoing, but we believe we are in good shape. Although, there's still work to be done at this point, we believe we're on track for a fourth quarter closing. On the integration front, hundreds of Gallagher and Willis Re professionals are hard at work ensuring we will be well positioned to service our clients when we close. Our 40 year acquisition history allows us to leverage our proven M&A integration path. Integration is in our DNA. We're looking forward to welcoming 2,200 new colleagues to Gallagher as a family of professionals this holiday season. It's really exciting to think about all the talent and expertise that will be joining us. It's going to be incredible for our combined organization and our clients. Okay, back to our quarterly results, starting with the brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was excellent at 16%, of that 9% was organic revenue growth, at the upper end of our September IR Day expectation and nearly 10% controlling for last year's large life product sale. Net earnings growth was 23% and we grew our adjusted EBITDA at 13%. Doug will provide some comments on third quarter margin and our fourth quarter outlook, but needless to say another excellent quarter from the brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and break down our organic by geography, starting with our PC operations. First, our domestic retail operations were very strong with more than 10% organic, results were driven by good new business combined with higher exposures and continued rate increases. Risk placement services, our domestic wholesale operations grew 16%. This includes more than 30% organic in open brokerage and 5% organic in our MGA programs in binding businesses. New business and retention were both up a point or so relative to 2020 levels. Outside the U.S., our UK operations posted more than 9% organic. Specialty was 12% and retail was a solid 6%, both supported by excellent new business production. Australia and New Zealand combined grew more than 6%, also benefiting from good new business. And finally, Canada was up nearly 10% on the back of double-digit new business and stable retention. Moving to our employee benefit, brokerage and consulting business. Third quarter organic was up about 5% in line with our September IR Day commentary, controlling for last year's large life insurance product sale, organic would have been up high single-digits and represents a really nice step up from the 4% organic we reported for the second quarter and the 2% organic for the first. So we were experiencing positive revenue momentum and really encouraging sign for the remainder of the year and 2022. So total brokerage segment, organic solidly in that 9% to 10% range, simply an excellent quarter. Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market. Global PC rates remain firm overall, and pricing is positive at nearly all product lines. Overall, third quarter renewal premium increases were about 8% and similar to increases during the first half of this year. Moving around the world, U.S. retail premiums up about 8%, including nearly 10% increases in casualty and professional liability. Even workers' comp was up around 5%. In Canada, premiums up about 9% driven by double-digit increases in professional liability and casualty, Australia and New Zealand combined up 3% to 4%. And UK retail was up about 7% with double-digit increases in professional liability while commercial auto is closer to flat. Finally, within RPS, wholesale open brokerage premiums were up more than 10% and binding operations were up 5%. Additionally, improved economic activity, even despite the Delta variant and supply chain disruptions are leading to positive policy endorsements and other favorable midterm policy adjustments as our customers add coverages and exposures to their existing policies. So premiums are still increasing almost everywhere. As we look ahead over the coming quarters, I see the PC market remaining difficult with rate increases persisting for quite a while. In the near-term, we don't see any meaningful changes in carrier underwriting, appetite capacity, attachment points or terms and conditions. Long-term markets do not appear to be seeing a slow down in rising loss costs. Global third quarter, natural catastrophe losses likely in excess of $40 billion increased cyber incidences, social inflation, replacement cost inflation and supply chain disruptions. And all of this is before factoring in further increases in claim frequency as global economies recover and become even more robust. All of these factors combined with low investment returns suggested carriers will continue to push for rate. I just don't see a dramatic change for the foreseeable future. So it's still a very difficult and even hard in many spots, global PC environment. But remember, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases through our creativity, expertise and market relationships. As we think about the environment for our employee benefits, let\u2019s improve business activity, lower unemployment, and increased demand for our consulting services is driving more revenue opportunities. And our customers and prospects continue to rapidly shift away from expense control strategies to plans and tactics that will help them grow their business. And with rebounding covered lives in one of the most challenging labor markets in memory, our consulting businesses are extremely well-positioned to deliver creative solutions to our clients. So as I sit here today, I think fourth quarter brokerage segment organic will be similar to the third quarter and that could take full year 2021 organic towards 8%. That would be a really nice improvement from the 3.2% organic we reported in 2020. To put that in perspective, 8% would be our best full year brokerage segment organic growth in nearly two decades. And we think 2022 organic will end up in a very similar range. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. I mentioned earlier, we completed five brokerage mergers during the quarter representing about $16 million of estimated annualized revenues. I\u2019d like to thank all our new partners for joining us. And I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in M&A pipeline, we have more than 50 term sheets signed are being prepared, representing around $400 million of annualized revenues. So even without the re-insurance merger, it\u2019s looking like we will finish 2021 strong wrapping up another successful year for our merger strategy. Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic growth was 16.6% even better than our September IR Day expectation. Margins were strong too. Adjusted EBITDAC margin once again came in above 19%. Results continue to benefit from late 2020 and early 2021 new business wins. In addition to further improvement in new arising claims within general liability and core workers\u2019 compensation just an exceptional quarter from the team. Looking forward, while our fourth quarter comparison is somewhat more challenging, the recovering global economy, improving employment situation and excellent new business production should result in fourth quarter organic over 10%. That puts us on track for double-digit full year organic and an EBITDAC margin nicely above 19%. As I look back over the last nine months, I can\u2019t help, but to be thoroughly impressed with our team and our accomplishments. Our commitment to our clients, and to each other\u2019s evident in our successes and that is due to our unique Gallagher culture. In these challenging times, our clients are continuing to count on us. And I\u2019m proud of our teams unwavering client focus. Gallagher\u2019s unique culture is founded on the values in the Gallagher way. Those values have kept us on a steady course throughout the pandemic. And time and time again during these past months, our clients have shared their trust and appreciation for the value Gallagher brings to the table. It comes down to talented individuals tapping into the power of our expertise across the globe, working together during this ongoing pandemic to continue to deliver for our clients. That\u2019s the Gallagher way, and it\u2019s the backbone of who we are as an organization. Okay. I\u2019ll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Pat, and hello everyone. As Pat said, a fantastic third quarter. Today, I\u2019ll touch on a few items in the earnings release, predominantly organic and margins, then I\u2019ll walk you through our CFO commentary document and finish up with my typical comments on cash, liquidity and capital management. Okay. Let\u2019s move to Page 4 of the earnings release and the Brokerage segment organic table. Headline all-in organic of 9%, outstanding on its own, but as Pat said, really running closer to 10% due to last year live sales, either way, a nice step up from the 6% we posted in the first quarter and the 6.8% in the second. As we sit now, I\u2019m seeing a fourth quarter organic again pushing that double-digit level. Turning now Page 6 to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Okay. Underlying margin after controlling for the live sale was around 160 basis points. Let me take you through the map to get you to that. First, headline margins were down 48 basis points, right about where we forecasted at our September IR Day. So controlling for the large live sale would bring us back to flat. Second, in September, we forecasted about $25 million of expenses returning into our structure as we emerged from the pandemic and a small amount of performance comp time. We call expenses returning mostly relate to higher utilization of our self-insured medical plans, resumption of advertising costs, more use of consultants, merit increases, and a small pickup and T&E expenses We came in right on that forecast. So controlling for these expenses also brings you to that underlying margin expansion of about 160 basis points that feels about right on organic in that 9% to 10% range. Looking forward, we think about $30 million of our pre-pandemic period expense savings return in the fourth quarter. And if you assume say 9% organic math would say, we should show 90 to 100 basis points of expansion here in the fourth quarter. So in the end, the headline story is that we have a really decent chance at growing our full year 2021 margins by nearly 150 basis points. And that\u2019s even growing over the live sale and the return of costs would come out of the pandemic. Add that to expanding margins over 400 basis points last year means we\u2019d be growing margins more than 550 basis points over two years. That really demonstrates the embedded improvements in how we do business. No matter how you look at it, it\u2019s simply outstanding work by the team. Moving to the Risk Management segment EBITDAC table on Page 7. Adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.5% in the quarter is an excellent result. Year-to-date, our margins are at 19.2%, which underscores our ability to maintain a large portion of our pandemic period savings. Looking forward, we think we can hold margins above 19% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That would result in about a 100 basis points of margin expansion relative to 2020, another fantastic margin story. Now I shift to our CFO commentary document we posted on our IR website. Starting on Page 4, you\u2019ll see most of the third quarter items are close to our September IR Day estimates. One small exception is Brokerage segment amortization expense about $3 million below our September IR Day estimate. It\u2019s simply because we finalized our valuation work on a recent 21 acquisition would causes a small catch-up estimate change. We adjusted that out on Page 1 of the earnings release. So it doesn\u2019t benefit adjusted EPS. Flipping to Page 5 and the Corporate segment table. There in actual third quarter results in the blue section to our September IR estimates in gray. Interest in banking line on a reported and adjusted basis were both in line. The non-GAAP adjustment here is that $12 million charge related to the early extinguishment of debt that we issued in May related to the terminated Aon and Willis remedy package. Acquisition cost line, mostly related to the Willis retransaction came in a bit higher than our IR Day estimate on a reported basis, but in line on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We will see some additional transaction related costs here in the fourth quarter should have a sense of what those costs might be at our December IR Day. Again, we plan on presenting these costs of the non-GAAP adjustment as well. On the corporate cost line, in line on an adjusted basis after controlling for $5 million of a one-time permanent tax item. That\u2019s a non-cash and it\u2019s simply a small valuation allowance related to a couple of international M&A transactions. And finally, clean energy. What a terrific quarter, came in much better than our estimate. Thanks for a warm September, less wind in certain areas of the country and higher natural gas prices. We are increasing our full year net earnings range to $87 million to $95 million on the back of the third quarter upside. Okay. As for cash and capital management and M&A. As you heard Pat say, we have a strong pipeline of tuck-in merger opportunities, and that\u2019s on top of the Willis reacquisition that we hope to close here in the fourth quarter. At September 30, cash on hand was about $2.7 billion and we have no outstanding borrowers on our credit facility. We plan to use that cash, cash flow generated during the fourth quarter and our line of credit to fund our \u2013 the acquisition of Willis Ray. Before I turn it back over to Pat, our year-to-date performance deserves I mention. Our brokerage and risk management segments combined have produced 15% growth in revenue, nearly 8% organic growth. We completed 19 new mergers this year with nearly $200 million of estimated annualized revenue, net earnings margin expanded 81 basis points, adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 153 basis points and our clean energy investments are on track to being up 30 this year. Setting us up nicely for substantial additional cash flows for the coming five to seven years. A terrific quarter in nine months on all measures, positions us for another great year. Okay. Those are my comments, back to you, Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Doug. And Hillary, we can go to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The call is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mike Zaremski of Wolfe Research. Please state your question.\nMike Zaremski: Great. Good evening. Hey, how are you?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Terrific.\nMike Zaremski: Maybe \u2013 great. Yes. Imagining great results. So maybe quickly on the Willis or maybe I should call it AJ Gallagher soon. There\u2019s a gap between kind of the estimated earnings you guys have disclosed and Willis disclosed, and there\u2019s also this kind of shared services stranded costs issue. And just kind of curious is, is that any color you can provide on whether your guide is baking in some, I guess, sharing of expenses that will eventually change over time and I guess, improve the earnings levels of the operation for you all.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Good question. Here\u2019s the thing. We believe we bought about $265 million worth of EBITDA, right? And I think if you kind of do some math on this morning\u2019s report, it looks like in the nine months reporting around $321 million \u2013 excuse me, $315 million worth of EBITDA. So their numbers are a little higher than ours. I can guess on why there\u2019s some differences. Their cost might not be fully loaded for costs that would \u2013 it would take us to run the business or they would be running the business on a standalone basis. But it was good to see the fact that their number was higher than ours.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Yes. That\u2019s what I\u2019m living too. So \u2013 but in terms of the shared services, is your current guidance baking in an expense that will over time fall?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No. I think that what they can service it for and well under the TSA and what we can ultimately service it for gets us back to that $265 million.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. I guess moving gears to the pricing environment from your color and the prepared remarks. Did I hear correct saying that worker\u2019s comp was plus five? And I guess, just generally it feels like there\u2019s kind of been less deceleration, I think, than some expected in terms of pricing. That seems like it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m curious, if you think it\u2019s emanating just from the property side or it\u2019s coming back on the casualty side as well, because maybe there\u2019s a more uncertainty about a loss inflation or maybe worker\u2019s comp claims are coming back. I know it\u2019s a long-winded question. But any color on kind of what\u2019s moving the pricing environment. Thanks.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes. Interestingly enough, with all the cat losses properties slightly down in rate, casually continues to spike a properties down quarter-over-quarter, just about a point and a half or so in rate and our book now. I\u2019m speaking about our book of business. Casually, is up a little over a point and worker\u2019s compensation is up about five. So these things moderate quarter-to-quarter that this is not a prediction of any sort for next year, but when we get ready for this call, we look at that and say, okay, what\u2019s actually happening in the market. By the way, our statistics are airtight, by-product, by geography, by billing as of yesterday. So I\u2019m very confident in these numbers. Overall rate is continuing to be up about 8%.\nDoug Howell: Yes. Just to add to that, if you look back at third quarter 2020, we had our whole portfolio of rate up 7.1%, and this third quarter 2021, it\u2019s up 7.9%. Now there\u2019s a little exposure unit adjustment in there on that. When you look at casually third quarter last year was 5.7%. It\u2019s up 8.4%. Liability was up 10.6% last year, it was up 10 points this year. Commercial auto granted I would \u2013 there\u2019s exposure units, and this was flat it\u2019s up 4% this quarter. Package, third quarter is 5.7% up 8.9% this quarter. Property up 11.2%, this quarter up 8%. Marine was 3% and it\u2019s up 6%. So when you look across all in were higher this year third quarter than we were last year third quarter by almost a full point.\nMike Zaremski: Interesting. Thank you for the color.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Mike.\nDoug Howell: And those are global numbers.\nOperator: Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening. My first question is following up on a topic that we discussed in your recent Investor Day, Doug. So we\u2019re discussing the potential for tax changes related to clean energy, and it sounded like there was still maybe a chance, but you guys were thinking the laws would sunset at the end of this year. Has anything changed there? And is it still the plan based on the discussion from September to rollout some type of cash earnings metrics? Is it sounded like in conjunction with first quarter of 2022 earnings?\nDoug Howell: Yes. We\u2019re still on track with a project that\u2019s going to convert it. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d necessarily call it cash. Let\u2019s be careful about that. But we\u2019re taking a look at how other publicly held brokers and professional services report their non-GAAP EPS and what I call a modified cash approach. And there are a number of different approaches out there whether it\u2019s adjusting for amortization depreciation, but then there\u2019s the subtleties of pension, stock-based compensation. So we\u2019re working through that, nothing to report today, but the projects ongoing, I hope to give you a better update at our December IR Day.\nElyse Greenspan: But if you were to roll it out, the plan would be sometime in March early April next year.\nDoug Howell: Yeah, I think so. I think we\u2019ll finish this year on this basis and then go to that basis next spring, the first quarter. We clearly have an IR Day, we\u2019d go back and represent everything historically on that basis. Let you be well-prepared so that let\u2019s say we did it first quarter that you wouldn\u2019t \u2013 that you can adjust all your models before we release.\nElyse Greenspan: And then in terms of the organic outlook for next year for brokerage, it sounds like you\u2019re expecting around 8% growth, which is what you expect this year to come in. Within I mean, I know we\u2019re still a little ways away and it\u2019s hard to have precision. But within that guide benefits was a little weak to start the year. So I guess that should be a tailwind or there just \u2013 would you expect that to be a tailwind and maybe brokerage slowed a little bit. But can you just help me understand kind of how you\u2019re seeing the moving parts within your businesses for 2022 as it sits today?\nDoug Howell: Well, I think we\u2019ll have two things. I think that they\u2019re slightly tougher compares when you get into 2022 because we did have this \u2013 we\u2019re having some good results here in 2021. But I think we do have some businesses that are recovering our programs, our binding businesses, our new business startups are recovering better than the wholesale business. I think you\u2019re starting to see covered lives increase, more consulting work coming back into the structure. Rate increases, we\u2019re not seeing that slowing down at all. So I think there\u2019s enough there on those other \u2013 in those other places that would offset the tougher compares next year.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks for the color.\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Elyse.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Shanker of Bank of America. Please state your question.\nJosh Shanker: Yes. Thank you very much for taking my question. So, given a 4Q 2021 close is Willis Re and the Gallagher Re organizations going to be unfortunately competing against each other on January 1. What\u2019s sort of the way you\u2019re managing that given such a close proximity to one, one renewals?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, what\u2019s really nice about this acquisition is there is very little, if almost no overlap. We are not competing head to head really on much at all Capsicum, which was a startup, very successful became of course, Gallagher Re. This is very complimentary business. There might be a few little areas here or there where they each touch, but there are no major renewals across the treaty book that are in conflict. And so what you\u2019ve got is the Gallagher Re people who you could imagine if you were just reading about this numbers to numbers, could be worried about a much larger competitor being acquired, being able to come in with their name, of course, and our brand and how are we going to sort that out? And what does that mean to the clients that they\u2019ve been calling on? Virtually none of that exists. So what you\u2019ve got is a team of people from the Willis Re side that are very excited. The people from Gallagher Re existing are very excited. They hit the ground running in January with a new, improved, much expanded Gallagher Re, and that\u2019s a branding exercise. It is outstanding for all parties and it brings tremendous additional capabilities because as a startup, as you can imagine, over three, four or five years, Capsicum Re has had to develop all the individual capabilities, one at a time, pay for it as they go, still driving decent margins and top line growth. Willis\u2019 is over a hundred years old. They built this stuff they\u2019ve just got terrific depth. And so it\u2019s going to be a very strong combination with almost no conflict whatsoever.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you. And when you talk about $400 million of annualized revenue on 50 term sheets, I sort of look at these lists of the biggest brokers and $20 million per acquisition, obviously they\u2019re going to come in different sizes, but there\u2019s obviously some larger ones out there numbers, $11 million through, let\u2019s say $50 million on any list you look at. In terms of cultural fit, do the \u2013 have you for the most part found cultural fit in the smaller tuck-ins that have that same entrepreneurial spirit? And are the larger brokers they have their own culture at this point that may not be as good of a fit for Gallagher going forward.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say Josh it\u2019s a matter of size, but here let\u2019s put this in perspective. There\u2019s according to Bobby Reagan\u2019s organization there\u2019s 39,000 agents and brokers in America and that\u2019s firms, not people. Now, number 100 on business insurances lists did $26 million last year. So when you look at what\u2019s available to be purchased, you\u2019ve got 100 that take you to $26 million. You\u2019ve got 38,900, less than that. And our people are out every day talking to our competitors and this is done right at the Street level. Not all of them are brought to the table by brokers that are representing them. And you have large ones that come up from time to time. And when we get a chance at the SIM and we get a chance to get to know them, our number one due diligence efforts still remains culture. You don\u2019t get to wash away culture by size and dollar amount. And no, I wouldn\u2019t say some bigger ones don\u2019t fit because they\u2019re bigger. There are some larger acquisitions we\u2019ve done in the past years that we were thrilled with the fit and they\u2019ve been thrilled with the fit. Now by item count, as you know, most of our acquisitions fall at the $10 million or less level, and yes, they fit extremely well into our entrepreneurial culture.\nDoug Howell: Yes. Josh, just to clarify, we\u2019ve got 50 outstanding term sheets on 400, which makes the average broker size about $8 million there.\nJosh Shanker: Yes. Your math is better than mine. It\u2019s been a long couple of days.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I get that.\nDoug Howell: I get it.\nJosh Shanker: Thank you for correcting me.\nDoug Howell: Sure. But there are some nice ones in here in that $20 million range too.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: And you\u2019re right. The top 100 have probably sold more of those in the last two years than probably five years before that combined. And that\u2019s a matter of all kinds of things, appetite, age, multiples, tax law, et cetera. And when we look at those, and if they fit culturally, we try hard to get them to join the team.\nJosh Shanker: Wonderful. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Hughes of Truist. Please state your question.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi, Mark.\nMark Hughes: Worker\u2019s comp you sounds like it doing better, any way to characterize, is this a change in appetite on the part of certain carriers? Is it just a higher payrolls what\u2019s driving that?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I think all of the above. I think you\u2019ve got, well, first of all, you have the economy recovering. So, we see that in our Gallagher Bassett numbers. You can see the economy in claim count growth. You do have social inflation, and you have you just got more work being done. And I think that makes a difference, but we\u2019re talking right here, and that\u2019s really driven by loss ratios and what they see. And the thing about worker\u2019s comp, I have to give our carrier partners credit. They know what\u2019s going on in that line every day, and when they see a need to move, right? And that\u2019s why during the hard market, many, many quarters we report flat work comp, because they didn\u2019t need the rate. So this is really interesting to me because they\u2019re not waiting around to find out that they\u2019re 25 points behind the eight ball, and then trying to get it back at one swoop. So, I think it\u2019s a good sign, both of their being on top of their numbers, incredibly well, a recovering economy and need for more and more premium in the line.\nMark Hughes: Doug, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m being dense here, but I\u2019m looking at your P&L on the press release, I guess in Page 6, the change in estimated acquisition or non payable to $34 million. And then in the CFO commentary, the recurring is I think described as $8 million pre-tax, what is the distinction between those two numbers? What\u2019s a good number going forward, do you think?\nDoug Howell: Okay. So you\u2019ve got the natural accretion of the earn-out liability. So, if we buy somebody and they\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve got $50 million on an earn-out. We discount that back around at about 8% per year. So, you\u2019ve got the accretion of what\u2019s going to be paid out. And then you\u2019ve got to change and what do you think the ultimate is? So again, think that total payout could be $50 million, let\u2019s say we put up $30 million worth of liability expecting kind of that they\u2019re going to perform at the 60% range. Yes, 8% accretion on $30 million, but if one day they really over-performing. We\u2019ve got to pump that up to a $40 million expectation. That that\u2019s the difference that goes to the change in an earn-out piece, as well as an accretion piece. So there were the two different pieces. What you\u2019re seeing those quarters. We did have some acquisitions that have are looking like they\u2019re going to better perform. And it\u2019s that that odd accounting that says that when we think that our acquisitions are going to perform better, we have to take a charge for that as we increase that liability. So\u2026\nMark Hughes: And is that adjust that out?\nDoug Howell: Yes. We do adjust that out.\nMark Hughes: Okay. So the reported EPS is correct for that. Does it correct to like the $9 million, $8 million or $9 million? Or does it go to take it to a\u2026\nDoug Howell: Well, the EPS is only adjusted for the change and the acquisition earn-out payable. It\u2019s not a adjusted out, for EPS, it\u2019s not adjusted out for amortization.\nMark Hughes: Yes, exactly. Okay.\nDoug Howell: The normal accretion of liability say then, it\u2019s the change in the ultimate payment.\nMark Hughes: Yes, I think I\u2019d probably appreciate it.\nDoug Howell: All right, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Montemaden of Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nDavid Montemaden: Hi, good afternoon.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi, David.\nDavid Montemaden: Hi. I had a bigger picture question just on the growth profile of the business. I guess it would be in 2023, when Willis Re is incorporated in the organic growth. If I look back over the last 10 years it looks like brokerage organic has been around for call it 4% or 5%. I guess, how are you thinking about Willis Re or should we think about it as just, increasing the base? So, we have like more of a higher base and we\u2019ll grow at a similar pace as we did in the previous 10 years or do you see this enhancing the company\u2019s growth profile going forward once that\u2019s fully reflected in organic?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I\u2019ll let Doug anchor you in reality. And let me give you fantasy. I think the fact is that this is a leg on the stool that we haven\u2019t had. And I think everybody on this call knows that I\u2019ve tried for years to be a big player in this business, failed miserably once got together with a great team and had a terrific start up a second time. I had a really exciting spring thinking that we were going to land this group of people into the company, through the acquisition of Willis by Aon had that rug pulled out from under me \u2013 in late May into June. And somehow was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to get this back on track for a close this year. So it\u2019s been a bit of a seesaw for me. And part of the reason I\u2019m excited about it is that it adds so much to the company. It adds, frankly, interestingly enough, to our ability to produce middle market retail property casually business on a global basis. Now, how is that possible? Well, number one data, number two, that data and analytics, but it also gives us a clear insight into what is troubling and exciting to the carrier world. What\u2019s going on in their capital plans. What are they seeing in accumulations? Where are we helping them? And how does that translate to what\u2019s going on the middle market take instruction. So that\u2019s just a whole another opportunity for me to get out in front of our team and say, look, our hit ratio today is improving, but it\u2019s still not that different than when I joined the business. Now, how can that be? We know that 90% plus of the time when we compete in the marketplace, we\u2019re competing with somebody smaller, typically the local agent or broker that we\u2019re buying. And frankly, we should be crushing that. So, I would hope that that would lead to even more organic growth, even into retail level. And then you go into looking at re-insurance, this is a \u2013 this isn\u2019t true, but there\u2019s three main players. We\u2019re going to be one of those. And yes, there are other players. And we were proud at [indiscernible] Gallagher to become the fifth largest at a $100 million in revenue. That\u2019s a great accomplishment, but a $1 billion player, that new capital coming into that market, that those carriers that are looking to do new things, treaties that need to be reworked and tweaked three competitors, I think we\u2019re going to do really well.\nDoug Howell: Yes. I\u2019ll put, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any fantasy in that that at all, I think that it will all perform our regular organic growth. So, I think how much more of that will be determined. But it\u2019s at the knob of capital creation. If you look at the Genesis of Gallagher way back when to really pioneer the alternative market, which is really capital creation, we take that with our cap as we take it with our, that the wholesaling where we're creating capital with other capital markets there to come up with programs. And, I think that it's going to give us an opportunity to create more capital combine that with the knowledge that we have with respect to certain long tail liability, like workers comp and general liability, I think that we can bring some pretty exciting capital formation together with Gallagher asset to help our self-insured clients. So, and then if you just get down into our retail business globally, I think a close partnership with the Willis and Gallagher Re, reinsurers will come up with much, with considerably more creative ideas. I believe in our culture where creative ideas get pursued. I think that will help us grow better together. So I don't think there's any fantasy in what Pat was saying.\nDavid Montemaden: Got it. Thanks so much for that answer. That's really helpful. I guess just also sticking on Willis Re, or I guess now Gallagher Re but wondering if you can just comment on the, just the third quarter performance and how that has compared to your expectations. I'm particularly interested in just attrition levels and Doug, I think you mentioned there's obviously was some volatility, earlier this year and in the summer. So just wanted to see just how retention has been holding up, employee retention since the announcement if you have a view on that?\nDoug Howell: Well, I'll be honest; we're not really allowed to have some of that while we're going through regulatory approval. And so our insight into the performance of that business is limited. It's necessary where with advanced integration planning can happen, but based on what I'm seeing; being reported right now is that it seems to be holding up very well. And I don't think that the breakage that we've assumed in our assumptions, is that they've hit anywhere near that. So I think that what it's holding up well and I got to give that team a lot of credit and they're holding that team together. They know it's going to be an exciting opportunity to be at Gallagher. So I'm a not seen financially any weakness in what we think that we're getting. \nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes, I think that's was going to be my comments around the team, that management team has held their team together through what I consider to be one of the greatest leadership challenges our industry's faced. Now, it's one thing to say, we've got an acquisition, it could be good for everybody, and we're going to get together with Aon and this is going to be terrific. And you've got a lot of doubters on both sides. And to your point earlier, where's the conflict, where's the headbutting going to be? Wow, you worked that through and then that's not really, what's going to happen. You're going to join Gallagher and that's going to be great, because there's not going to be the headbutting. They're not as big as we were together. We're not going be as big, but that's going to be great for you too. Well, that's not going to happen either. So there's no surprise as to why there was some attrition. And I can tell you since the announcement anecdotally, because Doug's right, we can't get into the numbers, but there's been very little attrition since the announcement that this is really going to happen.\nDavid Montemaden: Got it. Thanks. That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please state your question.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. It's related question on Willis Re and hopefully it's something you can answer. Are there any position to hire right now sort of in between being owned by Willis Towers Watson and being owned by Gallagher?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes, of course.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. I just didn't know whether there's any disruption in terms of I don't know capital or whatever. Broader question, I'm just curious in terms of how this works, when you've got raising insurance rates in an inflationary period, are your clients more or less price sensitive?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Oh man, are you kidding me? I I'll tell you.\nMeyer Shields: Nope.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: This is so good for us. The team's laughing in the room so I\u2019ve gone now, slow down everybody. Of course the clients are freaking out. You've got their costs going up before they've got their revenue adjusted to cover it. So take our construction risk. They've all bid everything already. They're in the middle of the job. Supply chains, cost of cement, cost of lumber, blah, blah, going up like crazy, every cost on their P&Ls under, they've got to look at everything. So here we come as a really, really good player in the construction area. Again, we compete 90% of the time and very nice accounts with smaller competitors. We can analyze and show them what's actually happening in the book by that type of cover by that type of client. And then we can show them that we can improve upon what they've been getting from their local agent. Yes, they're sensitive. Yes, it should be good new business for us.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And then the follow-up, which I guess you mostly answered already. Does that mean that your win ratios or your win rates go up relative to smaller competitors because of capability?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, perfect. I just wanted frame all this. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks Meyer.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Mark Hughes of Truist. Please state your question.\nMark Hughes: Yes, thanks. Doug, did you comment on, you talked about organic for 2022 being similar. This year you did 150 basis points in the brokerage segment on that organic, is that\u2019s a good bogie for next year as well? Are there any other costs coming or going that will influence that?\nDoug Howell: Yes, I think let's break it down. I think that an organic much like this year, next year that 9% to 10% range is possible 8%, 9%, 10% range. What will margins do next year? Well, some of that depends on how much further cost return to our structure that haven't yet returned to our structure. Remember we are pretty low cost basis still in the first quarter of 2021. So that will revert to next quarter in 2021 also. So I'll put a little pressure on the year-over-year. We're in the middle of budget and planning cycle right now. Mark, I'll have a better answer for you on that in December, but if we're pumping out organic growth pushing 10% next year, there's still opportunities for us to take some of that to the bottom-line. How much is that going to improve margin next year? Give me till December to figure that out.\nMark Hughes: Very good. And then I'll ask you on the shift to cash EPS I'm just looking at your CFO commentary and looking at that recurring amortization of $95 million any comments you'd like to add throw out how much of that might be added back for a cash EPS number?\nDoug Howell: Well, $400 million out a year. I think that in all cases that we've looked at a 100% of that has been added back. You got a tax effectively, but that's something that's, it's a big number.\nMark Hughes: And you wouldn't want to be outside of the mainstream on that. Would you doesn't sound like it?\nDoug Howell: Say that again?\nMark Hughes: I said you wouldn't want to be outside of the mainstream, if everybody else is adding the whole net back, you would want do the same thing that I presume?\nDoug Howell: I think comparability would be very helpful.\nMark Hughes: Right. Okay. Thank you for that. Appreciate it.\nDoug Howell: All right. Thanks Mark.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks Mark. And thanks everybody for your questions. So thank you again, all of you for joining us today. As we said over and over, we delivered a great third quarter and I'd like to thank our 35,000 plus colleagues around the globe for their hard work, dedication and unwavering client-centric attitude. We look forward to speaking to you again at our December Investor Day. Thank you for being with us and have a nice evening.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Doug Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and hello everyone. As Pat said, a fantastic third quarter. Today, I'll touch on a few items in the earnings release, predominantly organic and margins, then I'll walk you through our CFO commentary document and finish up with my typical comments on cash, liquidity and capital management. Okay. Let's move to Page 4 of the earnings release and the Brokerage segment organic table. Headline all-in organic of 9%, outstanding on its own, but as Pat said, really running closer to 10% due to last year live sales, either way, a nice step up from the 6% we posted in the first quarter and the 6.8% in the second. As we sit now, I'm seeing a fourth quarter organic again pushing that double-digit level. Turning now Page 6 to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Okay. Underlying margin after controlling for the live sale was around 160 basis points. Let me take you through the map to get you to that. First, headline margins were down 48 basis points, right about where we forecasted at our September IR Day. So controlling for the large live sale would bring us back to flat. Second, in September, we forecasted about $25 million of expenses returning into our structure as we emerged from the pandemic and a small amount of performance comp time. We call expenses returning mostly relate to higher utilization of our self-insured medical plans, resumption of advertising costs, more use of consultants, merit increases, and a small pickup and T&E expenses We came in right on that forecast. So controlling for these expenses also brings you to that underlying margin expansion of about 160 basis points that feels about right on organic in that 9% to 10% range. Looking forward, we think about $30 million of our pre-pandemic period expense savings return in the fourth quarter. And if you assume say 9% organic math would say, we should show 90 to 100 basis points of expansion here in the fourth quarter. So in the end, the headline story is that we have a really decent chance at growing our full year 2021 margins by nearly 150 basis points. And that's even growing over the live sale and the return of costs would come out of the pandemic. Add that to expanding margins over 400 basis points last year means we'd be growing margins more than 550 basis points over two years. That really demonstrates the embedded improvements in how we do business. No matter how you look at it, it's simply outstanding work by the team. Moving to the Risk Management segment EBITDAC table on Page 7. Adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.5% in the quarter is an excellent result. Year-to-date, our margins are at 19.2%, which underscores our ability to maintain a large portion of our pandemic period savings. Looking forward, we think we can hold margins above 19% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. That would result in about a 100 basis points of margin expansion relative to 2020, another fantastic margin story. Now I shift to our CFO commentary document we posted on our IR website. Starting on Page 4, you'll see most of the third quarter items are close to our September IR Day estimates. One small exception is Brokerage segment amortization expense about $3 million below our September IR Day estimate. It's simply because we finalized our valuation work on a recent 21 acquisition would causes a small catch-up estimate change. We adjusted that out on Page 1 of the earnings release. So it doesn't benefit adjusted EPS. Flipping to Page 5 and the Corporate segment table. There in actual third quarter results in the blue section to our September IR estimates in gray. Interest in banking line on a reported and adjusted basis were both in line. The non-GAAP adjustment here is that $12 million charge related to the early extinguishment of debt that we issued in May related to the terminated Aon and Willis remedy package. Acquisition cost line, mostly related to the Willis retransaction came in a bit higher than our IR Day estimate on a reported basis, but in line on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We will see some additional transaction related costs here in the fourth quarter should have a sense of what those costs might be at our December IR Day. Again, we plan on presenting these costs of the non-GAAP adjustment as well. On the corporate cost line, in line on an adjusted basis after controlling for $5 million of a one-time permanent tax item. That's a non-cash and it's simply a small valuation allowance related to a couple of international M&A transactions. And finally, clean energy. What a terrific quarter, came in much better than our estimate. Thanks for a warm September, less wind in certain areas of the country and higher natural gas prices. We are increasing our full year net earnings range to $87 million to $95 million on the back of the third quarter upside. Okay. As for cash and capital management and M&A. As you heard Pat say, we have a strong pipeline of tuck-in merger opportunities, and that's on top of the Willis reacquisition that we hope to close here in the fourth quarter. At September 30, cash on hand was about $2.7 billion and we have no outstanding borrowers on our credit facility. We plan to use that cash, cash flow generated during the fourth quarter and our line of credit to fund our \u2013 the acquisition of Willis Ray. Before I turn it back over to Pat, our year-to-date performance deserves I mention. Our brokerage and risk management segments combined have produced 15% growth in revenue, nearly 8% organic growth. We completed 19 new mergers this year with nearly $200 million of estimated annualized revenue, net earnings margin expanded 81 basis points, adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded 153 basis points and our clean energy investments are on track to being up 30 this year. Setting us up nicely for substantial additional cash flows for the coming five to seven years. A terrific quarter in nine months on all measures, positions us for another great year. Okay. Those are my comments, back to you, Pat. Yes. Just to add to that, if you look back at third quarter 2020, we had our whole portfolio of rate up 7.1%, and this third quarter 2021, it's up 7.9%. Now there's a little exposure unit adjustment in there on that. When you look at casually third quarter last year was 5.7%. It's up 8.4%. Liability was up 10.6% last year, it was up 10 points this year. Commercial auto granted I would \u2013 there's exposure units, and this was flat it's up 4% this quarter. Package, third quarter is 5.7% up 8.9% this quarter. Property up 11.2%, this quarter up 8%. Marine was 3% and it's up 6%. So when you look across all in were higher this year third quarter than we were last year third quarter by almost a full point. And those are global numbers. Yes. We're still on track with a project that's going to convert it. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it cash. Let's be careful about that. But we're taking a look at how other publicly held brokers and professional services report their non-GAAP EPS and what I call a modified cash approach. And there are a number of different approaches out there whether it's adjusting for amortization depreciation, but then there's the subtleties of pension, stock-based compensation. So we're working through that, nothing to report today, but the projects ongoing, I hope to give you a better update at our December IR Day. Yeah, I think so. I think we'll finish this year on this basis and then go to that basis next spring, the first quarter. We clearly have an IR Day, we'd go back and represent everything historically on that basis. Let you be well-prepared so that let's say we did it first quarter that you wouldn't \u2013 that you can adjust all your models before we release. Well, I think we'll have two things. I think that they're slightly tougher compares when you get into 2022 because we did have this \u2013 we're having some good results here in 2021. But I think we do have some businesses that are recovering our programs, our binding businesses, our new business startups are recovering better than the wholesale business. I think you're starting to see covered lives increase, more consulting work coming back into the structure. Rate increases, we're not seeing that slowing down at all. So I think there's enough there on those other \u2013 in those other places that would offset the tougher compares next year. Thanks, Elyse. Yes. Josh, just to clarify, we've got 50 outstanding term sheets on 400, which makes the average broker size about $8 million there. I get it. Sure. But there are some nice ones in here in that $20 million range too. Okay. So you've got the natural accretion of the earn-out liability. So, if we buy somebody and they've got \u2013 we've got $50 million on an earn-out. We discount that back around at about 8% per year. So, you've got the accretion of what's going to be paid out. And then you've got to change and what do you think the ultimate is? So again, think that total payout could be $50 million, let's say we put up $30 million worth of liability expecting kind of that they're going to perform at the 60% range. Yes, 8% accretion on $30 million, but if one day they really over-performing. We've got to pump that up to a $40 million expectation. That that's the difference that goes to the change in an earn-out piece, as well as an accretion piece. So there were the two different pieces. What you're seeing those quarters. We did have some acquisitions that have are looking like they're going to better perform. And it's that that odd accounting that says that when we think that our acquisitions are going to perform better, we have to take a charge for that as we increase that liability. So... Yes. We do adjust that out. Well, the EPS is only adjusted for the change and the acquisition earn-out payable. It's not a adjusted out, for EPS, it's not adjusted out for amortization. The normal accretion of liability say then, it's the change in the ultimate payment. All right, thanks. Yes. I'll put, I don't think there's any fantasy in that that at all, I think that it will all perform our regular organic growth. So, I think how much more of that will be determined. But it's at the knob of capital creation. If you look at the Genesis of Gallagher way back when to really pioneer the alternative market, which is really capital creation, we take that with our cap as we take it with our, that the wholesaling where we're creating capital with other capital markets there to come up with programs. And, I think that it's going to give us an opportunity to create more capital combine that with the knowledge that we have with respect to certain long tail liability, like workers comp and general liability, I think that we can bring some pretty exciting capital formation together with Gallagher asset to help our self-insured clients. So, and then if you just get down into our retail business globally, I think a close partnership with the Willis and Gallagher Re, reinsurers will come up with much, with considerably more creative ideas. I believe in our culture where creative ideas get pursued. I think that will help us grow better together. So I don't think there's any fantasy in what Pat was saying. Well, I'll be honest; we're not really allowed to have some of that while we're going through regulatory approval. And so our insight into the performance of that business is limited. It's necessary where with advanced integration planning can happen, but based on what I'm seeing; being reported right now is that it seems to be holding up very well. And I don't think that the breakage that we've assumed in our assumptions, is that they've hit anywhere near that. So I think that what it's holding up well and I got to give that team a lot of credit and they're holding that team together. They know it's going to be an exciting opportunity to be at Gallagher. So I'm a not seen financially any weakness in what we think that we're getting. Yes, I think let's break it down. I think that an organic much like this year, next year that 9% to 10% range is possible 8%, 9%, 10% range. What will margins do next year? Well, some of that depends on how much further cost return to our structure that haven't yet returned to our structure. Remember we are pretty low cost basis still in the first quarter of 2021. So that will revert to next quarter in 2021 also. So I'll put a little pressure on the year-over-year. We're in the middle of budget and planning cycle right now. Mark, I'll have a better answer for you on that in December, but if we're pumping out organic growth pushing 10% next year, there's still opportunities for us to take some of that to the bottom-line. How much is that going to improve margin next year? Give me till December to figure that out. Well, $400 million out a year. I think that in all cases that we've looked at a 100% of that has been added back. You got a tax effectively, but that's something that's, it's a big number. Say that again? I think comparability would be very helpful. All right. Thanks Mark."

            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had a fantastic third quarter. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments we posted 17% growth in revenue, 10% organic growth and nearly 11% organic, if you control for last year's large life sale that we've discussed frequently. Net earnings growth of 22%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% and we completed five new mergers in the quarter bringing our year-to-date closed merger counts in 19 representing nearly $200 million of annualized revenue. And if you add in the pending Willis Reinsurance merger, that number would be pushing $1 billion. So the team continues to execute at a very high level, growing organically, growing through acquisitions, improving our productivity, raising our quality, and most importantly, constantly building upon our unique Gallagher culture, a terrific quarter on all measures. Let me provide a brief update on our agreement to purchase Willis Re. On the regulatory approval front, we received competition clearance in five or six jurisdictions required to close, including clearance by the U.S. Department of Justice. The final jurisdiction in the UK, where the CMA is reviewing the transaction, that's the final jurisdiction. That review is ongoing, but we believe we are in good shape. Although, there's still work to be done at this point, we believe we're on track for a fourth quarter closing. On the integration front, hundreds of Gallagher and Willis Re professionals are hard at work ensuring we will be well positioned to service our clients when we close. Our 40 year acquisition history allows us to leverage our proven M&A integration path. Integration is in our DNA. We're looking forward to welcoming 2,200 new colleagues to Gallagher as a family of professionals this holiday season. It's really exciting to think about all the talent and expertise that will be joining us. It's going to be incredible for our combined organization and our clients. Okay, back to our quarterly results, starting with the brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was excellent at 16%, of that 9% was organic revenue growth, at the upper end of our September IR Day expectation and nearly 10% controlling for last year's large life product sale. Net earnings growth was 23% and we grew our adjusted EBITDA at 13%. Doug will provide some comments on third quarter margin and our fourth quarter outlook, but needless to say another excellent quarter from the brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and break down our organic by geography, starting with our PC operations. First, our domestic retail operations were very strong with more than 10% organic, results were driven by good new business combined with higher exposures and continued rate increases. Risk placement services, our domestic wholesale operations grew 16%. This includes more than 30% organic in open brokerage and 5% organic in our MGA programs in binding businesses. New business and retention were both up a point or so relative to 2020 levels. Outside the U.S., our UK operations posted more than 9% organic. Specialty was 12% and retail was a solid 6%, both supported by excellent new business production. Australia and New Zealand combined grew more than 6%, also benefiting from good new business. And finally, Canada was up nearly 10% on the back of double-digit new business and stable retention. Moving to our employee benefit, brokerage and consulting business. Third quarter organic was up about 5% in line with our September IR Day commentary, controlling for last year's large life insurance product sale, organic would have been up high single-digits and represents a really nice step up from the 4% organic we reported for the second quarter and the 2% organic for the first. So we were experiencing positive revenue momentum and really encouraging sign for the remainder of the year and 2022. So total brokerage segment, organic solidly in that 9% to 10% range, simply an excellent quarter. Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market. Global PC rates remain firm overall, and pricing is positive at nearly all product lines. Overall, third quarter renewal premium increases were about 8% and similar to increases during the first half of this year. Moving around the world, U.S. retail premiums up about 8%, including nearly 10% increases in casualty and professional liability. Even workers' comp was up around 5%. In Canada, premiums up about 9% driven by double-digit increases in professional liability and casualty, Australia and New Zealand combined up 3% to 4%. And UK retail was up about 7% with double-digit increases in professional liability while commercial auto is closer to flat. Finally, within RPS, wholesale open brokerage premiums were up more than 10% and binding operations were up 5%. Additionally, improved economic activity, even despite the Delta variant and supply chain disruptions are leading to positive policy endorsements and other favorable midterm policy adjustments as our customers add coverages and exposures to their existing policies. So premiums are still increasing almost everywhere. As we look ahead over the coming quarters, I see the PC market remaining difficult with rate increases persisting for quite a while. In the near-term, we don't see any meaningful changes in carrier underwriting, appetite capacity, attachment points or terms and conditions. Long-term markets do not appear to be seeing a slow down in rising loss costs. Global third quarter, natural catastrophe losses likely in excess of $40 billion increased cyber incidences, social inflation, replacement cost inflation and supply chain disruptions. And all of this is before factoring in further increases in claim frequency as global economies recover and become even more robust. All of these factors combined with low investment returns suggested carriers will continue to push for rate. I just don't see a dramatic change for the foreseeable future. So it's still a very difficult and even hard in many spots, global PC environment. But remember, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases through our creativity, expertise and market relationships. As we think about the environment for our employee benefits, let's improve business activity, lower unemployment, and increased demand for our consulting services is driving more revenue opportunities. And our customers and prospects continue to rapidly shift away from expense control strategies to plans and tactics that will help them grow their business. And with rebounding covered lives in one of the most challenging labor markets in memory, our consulting businesses are extremely well-positioned to deliver creative solutions to our clients. So as I sit here today, I think fourth quarter brokerage segment organic will be similar to the third quarter and that could take full year 2021 organic towards 8%. That would be a really nice improvement from the 3.2% organic we reported in 2020. To put that in perspective, 8% would be our best full year brokerage segment organic growth in nearly two decades. And we think 2022 organic will end up in a very similar range. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. I mentioned earlier, we completed five brokerage mergers during the quarter representing about $16 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all our new partners for joining us. And I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in M&A pipeline, we have more than 50 term sheets signed are being prepared, representing around $400 million of annualized revenues. So even without the re-insurance merger, it's looking like we will finish 2021 strong wrapping up another successful year for our merger strategy. Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic growth was 16.6% even better than our September IR Day expectation. Margins were strong too. Adjusted EBITDAC margin once again came in above 19%. Results continue to benefit from late 2020 and early 2021 new business wins. In addition to further improvement in new arising claims within general liability and core workers' compensation just an exceptional quarter from the team. Looking forward, while our fourth quarter comparison is somewhat more challenging, the recovering global economy, improving employment situation and excellent new business production should result in fourth quarter organic over 10%. That puts us on track for double-digit full year organic and an EBITDAC margin nicely above 19%. As I look back over the last nine months, I can't help, but to be thoroughly impressed with our team and our accomplishments. Our commitment to our clients, and to each other's evident in our successes and that is due to our unique Gallagher culture. In these challenging times, our clients are continuing to count on us. And I'm proud of our teams unwavering client focus. Gallagher's unique culture is founded on the values in the Gallagher way. Those values have kept us on a steady course throughout the pandemic. And time and time again during these past months, our clients have shared their trust and appreciation for the value Gallagher brings to the table. It comes down to talented individuals tapping into the power of our expertise across the globe, working together during this ongoing pandemic to continue to deliver for our clients. That's the Gallagher way, and it's the backbone of who we are as an organization. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thanks, Doug. And Hillary, we can go to questions. Terrific. Good question. Here's the thing. We believe we bought about $265 million worth of EBITDA, right? And I think if you kind of do some math on this morning's report, it looks like in the nine months reporting around $321 million \u2013 excuse me, $315 million worth of EBITDA. So their numbers are a little higher than ours. I can guess on why there's some differences. Their cost might not be fully loaded for costs that would \u2013 it would take us to run the business or they would be running the business on a standalone basis. But it was good to see the fact that their number was higher than ours. No. I think that what they can service it for and well under the TSA and what we can ultimately service it for gets us back to that $265 million. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Yes. Interestingly enough, with all the cat losses properties slightly down in rate, casually continues to spike a properties down quarter-over-quarter, just about a point and a half or so in rate and our book now. I'm speaking about our book of business. Casually, is up a little over a point and worker's compensation is up about five. So these things moderate quarter-to-quarter that this is not a prediction of any sort for next year, but when we get ready for this call, we look at that and say, okay, what's actually happening in the market. By the way, our statistics are airtight, by-product, by geography, by billing as of yesterday. So I'm very confident in these numbers. Overall rate is continuing to be up about 8%. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Elyse. Well, what's really nice about this acquisition is there is very little, if almost no overlap. We are not competing head to head really on much at all Capsicum, which was a startup, very successful became of course, Gallagher Re. This is very complimentary business. There might be a few little areas here or there where they each touch, but there are no major renewals across the treaty book that are in conflict. And so what you've got is the Gallagher Re people who you could imagine if you were just reading about this numbers to numbers, could be worried about a much larger competitor being acquired, being able to come in with their name, of course, and our brand and how are we going to sort that out? And what does that mean to the clients that they've been calling on? Virtually none of that exists. So what you've got is a team of people from the Willis Re side that are very excited. The people from Gallagher Re existing are very excited. They hit the ground running in January with a new, improved, much expanded Gallagher Re, and that's a branding exercise. It is outstanding for all parties and it brings tremendous additional capabilities because as a startup, as you can imagine, over three, four or five years, Capsicum Re has had to develop all the individual capabilities, one at a time, pay for it as they go, still driving decent margins and top line growth. Willis' is over a hundred years old. They built this stuff they've just got terrific depth. And so it's going to be a very strong combination with almost no conflict whatsoever. I don't know if I'd say Josh it's a matter of size, but here let's put this in perspective. There's according to Bobby Reagan's organization there's 39,000 agents and brokers in America and that's firms, not people. Now, number 100 on business insurances lists did $26 million last year. So when you look at what's available to be purchased, you've got 100 that take you to $26 million. You've got 38,900, less than that. And our people are out every day talking to our competitors and this is done right at the Street level. Not all of them are brought to the table by brokers that are representing them. And you have large ones that come up from time to time. And when we get a chance at the SIM and we get a chance to get to know them, our number one due diligence efforts still remains culture. You don't get to wash away culture by size and dollar amount. And no, I wouldn't say some bigger ones don't fit because they're bigger. There are some larger acquisitions we've done in the past years that we were thrilled with the fit and they've been thrilled with the fit. Now by item count, as you know, most of our acquisitions fall at the $10 million or less level, and yes, they fit extremely well into our entrepreneurial culture. I get that. And you're right. The top 100 have probably sold more of those in the last two years than probably five years before that combined. And that's a matter of all kinds of things, appetite, age, multiples, tax law, et cetera. And when we look at those, and if they fit culturally, we try hard to get them to join the team. Thanks. Hi, Mark. I think all of the above. I think you've got, well, first of all, you have the economy recovering. So, we see that in our Gallagher Bassett numbers. You can see the economy in claim count growth. You do have social inflation, and you have you just got more work being done. And I think that makes a difference, but we're talking right here, and that's really driven by loss ratios and what they see. And the thing about worker's comp, I have to give our carrier partners credit. They know what's going on in that line every day, and when they see a need to move, right? And that's why during the hard market, many, many quarters we report flat work comp, because they didn't need the rate. So this is really interesting to me because they're not waiting around to find out that they're 25 points behind the eight ball, and then trying to get it back at one swoop. So, I think it's a good sign, both of their being on top of their numbers, incredibly well, a recovering economy and need for more and more premium in the line. Hi, David. Well, I'll let Doug anchor you in reality. And let me give you fantasy. I think the fact is that this is a leg on the stool that we haven't had. And I think everybody on this call knows that I've tried for years to be a big player in this business, failed miserably once got together with a great team and had a terrific start up a second time. I had a really exciting spring thinking that we were going to land this group of people into the company, through the acquisition of Willis by Aon had that rug pulled out from under me \u2013 in late May into June. And somehow was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to get this back on track for a close this year. So it's been a bit of a seesaw for me. And part of the reason I'm excited about it is that it adds so much to the company. It adds, frankly, interestingly enough, to our ability to produce middle market retail property casually business on a global basis. Now, how is that possible? Well, number one data, number two, that data and analytics, but it also gives us a clear insight into what is troubling and exciting to the carrier world. What's going on in their capital plans. What are they seeing in accumulations? Where are we helping them? And how does that translate to what's going on the middle market take instruction. So that's just a whole another opportunity for me to get out in front of our team and say, look, our hit ratio today is improving, but it's still not that different than when I joined the business. Now, how can that be? We know that 90% plus of the time when we compete in the marketplace, we're competing with somebody smaller, typically the local agent or broker that we're buying. And frankly, we should be crushing that. So, I would hope that that would lead to even more organic growth, even into retail level. And then you go into looking at re-insurance, this is a \u2013 this isn't true, but there's three main players. We're going to be one of those. And yes, there are other players. And we were proud at [indiscernible] Gallagher to become the fifth largest at a $100 million in revenue. That's a great accomplishment, but a $1 billion player, that new capital coming into that market, that those carriers that are looking to do new things, treaties that need to be reworked and tweaked three competitors, I think we're going to do really well. Yes, I think that's was going to be my comments around the team, that management team has held their team together through what I consider to be one of the greatest leadership challenges our industry's faced. Now, it's one thing to say, we've got an acquisition, it could be good for everybody, and we're going to get together with Aon and this is going to be terrific. And you've got a lot of doubters on both sides. And to your point earlier, where's the conflict, where's the headbutting going to be? Wow, you worked that through and then that's not really, what's going to happen. You're going to join Gallagher and that's going to be great, because there's not going to be the headbutting. They're not as big as we were together. We're not going be as big, but that's going to be great for you too. Well, that's not going to happen either. So there's no surprise as to why there was some attrition. And I can tell you since the announcement anecdotally, because Doug's right, we can't get into the numbers, but there's been very little attrition since the announcement that this is really going to happen. Thanks, David. Yes, of course. Oh man, are you kidding me? I I'll tell you. This is so good for us. The team's laughing in the room so I've gone now, slow down everybody. Of course the clients are freaking out. You've got their costs going up before they've got their revenue adjusted to cover it. So take our construction risk. They've all bid everything already. They're in the middle of the job. Supply chains, cost of cement, cost of lumber, blah, blah, going up like crazy, every cost on their P&Ls under, they've got to look at everything. So here we come as a really, really good player in the construction area. Again, we compete 90% of the time and very nice accounts with smaller competitors. We can analyze and show them what's actually happening in the book by that type of cover by that type of client. And then we can show them that we can improve upon what they've been getting from their local agent. Yes, they're sensitive. Yes, it should be good new business for us. Yes. Thanks Meyer. Thanks Mark. And thanks everybody for your questions. So thank you again, all of you for joining us today. As we said over and over, we delivered a great third quarter and I'd like to thank our 35,000 plus colleagues around the globe for their hard work, dedication and unwavering client-centric attitude. We look forward to speaking to you again at our December Investor Day. Thank you for being with us and have a nice evening."

Patrick Gallagher: Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had an excellent second quarter. The team delivered on all four of our long-term operating priorities to drive shareholder value. We grew organically. We grew through acquisitions, improved our productivity all while raising our quality and maintaining our unique Gallagher culture. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 17% growth in revenue, 8.6% organic growth, but it's over 10% when adjusted for timing, which Doug will spend some time on in a few minutes. Net earnings margin expansion of 107 basis points, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 30 basis points. And we completed eight new mergers in the quarter, with more than $70 million of estimated annualized revenue. Most importantly, our Gallagher culture continues to thrive. Just a fantastic quarter on all measures. Now, before I discuss how each of our businesses performed in more detail, let me comment briefly about the termination of our agreement to purchase certain Willis Towers Watson brokerage operations. We were excited about the opportunity. We would have loved to complete the transaction. There are a lot of great people at Willis and they would have been a great addition to our team. But here's the key point. With or without this, we remained very well-positioned to support our clients, compete for new ones and ultimately drive value for all of our stakeholders. We're in the greatest business on earth. Our culture is stronger than ever, and I'm excited about our future.  Okay. Back to our quarterly results. Starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was strong at 16%, of that 6.8% was organic revenue growth, a little better than our June IR Day expectation and closer to 9% adjusted for timing. Our net earnings margin moved higher by 53 basis points and our adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded by 23 basis points, highlighting our continued expense discipline. Another excellent quarter from the Brokerage team.\nDouglas Howell: Thanks Pat and hello everyone. As Pat said, an excellent quarter and first half of the year. Today, I'll spend a little extra time on organic and then give you our current thinking on expenses and margins. Then, I'll walk you through some of the items on our CFO commentary document, and I'll finish up with some comments on cash, liquidity and capital management. Okay. Let's move to page four of the earnings release and the Brokerage segment organic table. Headline all in organic of 6.8%, excellent on its own, but as pat said, really running closer to 9%. There's two reasons for that. First, recall that we had some favorable timing in our first quarter related to contingent commissions that caused a little unfavorable timing here in the second quarter, call that 70 basis points. Second, also recall that we took our 606 revenue accounting adjustment in the first quarter of 2020, we then adjusted that in the second quarter of 2020. So that creates a more difficult compare this year second quarter, call that about 150 basis points. These two items combined for about 220 basis points of a headwind here in the second quarter. We don't expect similar headwinds in the second half. Okay. Let's go to page six to the Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC table. You'll see that we expanded our EBITDAC margin by 23 basis points here in the second quarter. Considering last year second quarter was in the depth of the pandemic and our Brokerage segment save $60 million in that quarter to post any expansion at all this quarter is terrific work by the team, shows we are indeed holding a lot of our savings. So, the natural question is, when you levelize for the $60 million of pandemic savings last year second quarter, and about $15 million of cost that came back this second quarter, what was the underlying margin expansion? Answer to that is about 125 basis points, which on 6.8% organic feels about right. That $15 million mostly relates to higher utilization of our self-insurance medical plans, a modest pickup in T&E expenses and incentive comp. So, we held $45 million of cost savings this quarter. And that's really terrific. Looking forward, we continue to think we can hold a lot of our pandemic period savings, perhaps more than half, but naturally some of those costs will come back. As of now we think about $20 million of costs returned in the third quarter and $30 million return in the fourth quarter, both of those numbers are relative to last year same quarters. So, again, the natural question might be, what organic do you need to post third and fourth quarter to overcome those expenses and still have margin expansion? Math would say about 7%, which is really the real story. Recall at the beginning of the year, after expanding margins 420 basis points in 2020, we were looking at just holding margins flat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks Doug. Laura, I think we take some questions now.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good evening.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Good evening.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on, Pat, your organic growth comments. I think you mentioned that you guys would get the full year to 8%. So, if my math is right, if you were sitting at 6.4% for the first half of the year, that would imply that you guys are expecting the back half to come close to 10%. Is there something wrong with that thinking, or are you thinking given the timing impact in the second quarter so we get close to double-digits in the second half a year within Brokerage?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah. Elyse, I think you might be a little strong on that, based on the math. So, just take a look at it again. I think why are math produced more like, towards 9%.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. So, 9%. Okay. Close. And then my second question, you guys announced a $1.5 billion share repurchase program, right, to effectively buyback the stock issued for the Willis deal. So I just wanted to get a sense of timing on the buybacks. Is that something you expect to complete this year? And then, is the expectation that you will buyback all those shares? Or is that also a little bit dependent upon some of the tuck-in deals if some of them come together pretty quickly?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No, I think as we sit right now, our intent is to repurchase the $1.5 billion. We think we can get that done in short order also and certainly by the end of the year. Now the point here is that we're -- we won't let access capital sip idle by any means.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the margin side if you were, give us some helpful information and you were giving an example, right, that if you guys get to pull your data of 7%, that you could show a 100 basis points of margin improvement. So, is that with the states coming back or is that kind of after adjusting for the impact of days or the expectation that we'll be about a 100 points of margin within Brokerage this year?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah. I think, what I was doing is using the illustration of saying if we post 7% for the full year, you'd see about a 100 basis points of margin expansion, even with those costs coming back into our structure. And clearly if we better 7%, we should be able to better that too.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the color.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Sure.\nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Elyse\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Good evening. I had a question, just on the expense side. If I just look in Brokerage at the operating expenses, non-comp, non-D&A, just the OpEx line, if I take out the $15 million of incremental costs, it looks like expenses were roughly flat year-over-year. Doug, I think you spoke about this a little bit in your comments. But I guess I'm just wondering, is that sort of right that the underlying expenses in the business, or sort of flat year-over-year and would you expect that to continue for the rest of this year?\nDouglas Howell: So, did you take the entire $15 million out of OpEx or did you spread some of that into comp and then also did you factor in M&A, but you're not far off of it, being pretty close to flat when you factor in M&A.\nDavid Motemaden: Yeah. I was just looking purely at OpEx. So, it was roughly flat, but that's something that you think can continue for the rest of the year, just given some of the changes you guys made over the course of last year.\nDouglas Howell: Yeah. I think there was -- I guess I think the $20 million will come back in the third quarter of expensive, and I think $30 million will come back in the fourth quarter. That will be split some between OpEx and some between compensation. But by and large, our underlying costs, other than maybe in the IT areas, we're starting to see savings in real estate. We're starting to see savings in professional fees. We are seeing increases in travel and entertainment expenses because some of our clients are expecting us to be there and we're happy to be there for it. But you are seeing some good learnings from the pandemic. We have pretty well taken care of all of our incoming, outgoing mail. It's saving some costs there, so we can centralize that so we can deploy mail anywhere around the world with the touch of a button. So, there are some good projects that have been going on to -- that we're continuing to harvest out of the operating expense line.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Yeah. That continues to come in a bit better than I would've thought. I guess, any sort of update on the thinking in terms of the sustainable expense saves, that you -- that you're getting from COVID of the -- I think it was 150 to 175. Is that still a good sort of level to think about, or -- yeah, any sort of changes to that?\nDouglas Howell: Yeah. Let's level set. We were saving, let's say -- let's call it $65 million a quarter during the pandemic. And we think that we can hold $30 million of that -- $35 million of that. So, again, back to -- I don't know where your 150 came from, unless it was 60 times, four or five -- four and a half, and then divided by two. But where'd you get the 150 from?\nDavid Motemaden: I was using more of a range, that you guys have given. But that makes sense.\nDouglas Howell: Okay.\nDavid Motemaden: That makes sense. Thanks for that. I guess also -- maybe just on the growth side, I guess, could you just break down if we sort of look at the organic, the 9% in Brokerage on sort of a clean basis? Could you just talk about some of the different components of that? Whether that is, rate versus exposure versus new business and share gains and how you expect each of those to trend over the course of this year.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Okay. So, new business was stronger than where we were, same second quarter or for also say the year new business range stronger. Retention is about the same, getting lift from rate and exposure that when we combine that together, right now I think it's about 50/50. rate and 50% exposure.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist. You may proceed with your question.\nMark Hughes: Yeah. Thank you very much. Good afternoon.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Good afternoon, Mark.\nMark Hughes: I think some of your end markets have been a little slower getting ramped up, maybe compared to other more cyclical end markets. Could you expand on that just a little bit?\nDouglas Howell: What do you mean end markets?\nMark Hughes: You're talking about your customers. If I heard you properly, tell me if I didn't, but your customers.\nDouglas Howell: Our employee benefits business, you see a lot of headline recovery in employment stats that generally are citing retail, hospitality, transportation -- travel related industries. Our customer base is not concentrated in those industries. It's more diverse than that. And it's just the return to work and our customer base isn't quite at those headline returning to work numbers you see there. That what you're asking about, Mark? Nothing, it's just the mix of business down in the benefits business.\nMark Hughes: Right. Yeah. Gotcha. Yeah. No, that was my question. Then, Pat, on the pricing, I might not have heard all your commentary, but it seems like -- looking at some of your specific numbers compared to last time they were as good or better in Q1, it seems like there's some broader discussion of potential deceleration. Why do you think you may be seeing it a little more optimistically than others perhaps?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No. I just -- from where I sit, Mark, when I'm talking to people in the field and when I'm talking to our underwriting partners, there just doesn't seem to be any appetite for cutting. Now rate of increase is down, but I'm not seeing people say, oh gosh, we've got this thing right. Let's open the flood gates.\nDouglas Howell: We're seeing a little bit. I think that there's a little bit of -- I think the larger account market or larger size market, we saw increases in premiums there that were a little higher than, let's say, the mid-market of a smaller market throughout the end of 2020 and here in the first half of 2021. So, we're just not seeing if a large account market is not growing rates quite as fast as they were in the past. We're not really seeing that as much in the mid-market. We are seeing it more consistent with first quarter and fourth quarter. You lose there, Mark?\nMark Hughes: No. No. Here -- I'm back. I'm sorry. I'm just curious if in a public forum, any thoughts you'd care to share around potential for adding some staff in light of the Willis Towers Watson, Aon breakup, you seeing anything out in the market? Any people moving that is noteworthy?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, no. We don't. But as you know, Mark, you follow us a long time. Our organic hiring is a big part of our strategy and there's no doubt that we're going to continue to hire production talent across all the lines of business that we've got. And our doors of all -- even in the depths of the soft market, as you followed us, the doors open for production talent.\nMark Hughes: Very good. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. You may proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. I wanted a little bit on capital management, I guess it's $850 million of the raised debt that you're keeping, is it interpret, Doug, your comments about M&A potential as being able to utilize that $850 million?\nDouglas Howell: Yeah. Absolutely. That's cash in the bank right now. We think that, that -- and we might have to borrow a little bit more towards the end of the year for part of next year, depending on how the M&A pipeline looks at, but the $650 million there's a special mandatory redemption feature in there. So, we'll pay that back. And then what happened with the $850 million that we raised along with that, that -- we'll get that to work here in the second half of the year.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. I might be find you hard with this one. But if you're expecting an increase in potential sellers because of capital gains tax rates, is that likely to depress placing on these assets at all?\nDouglas Howell: You might have a little that end, but I think it will put -- truthfully, I think that it might put -- pricing might stay the same and it actually might pull forward a little bit less on an earn-out and more up front. So you put it here in this year, you might feel bad. Is it a full turn on the multiple, maybe to accelerate it, not have as much on that earn-out, but I wouldn't say it's going to cause a big decrease in pricing.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No, there's a lot of competition for deals out there.\nMeyer Shields: Yeah. Fair enough. Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from the line of Alex Bolan  with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: I am calling in on behalf of Greg Peters. Maybe kind of sticking with M&A, and the tuck-in conversation, when you're talking, I guess to potential is, as tuck-in up within the conversation as of now, or is that still a thought?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: It's coming up every time.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then, when looking at, I guess, M&A, I guess what is the size of acquisitions you're considering? Has that changed at all?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No. We're good at tuck-ins. By the way, looks also, Greg knows this very well. If in fact there's 39,000 agents and brokers in America, let's remember that business insurance that just brought out it's a July edition this month number 100 was $25 million in revenue. So the playing field is full of really, really good tuck-in players.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That makes sense. And then, when thinking about margin expansion and the effect T&E has, maybe you can touch on -- your thoughts around deployment of T&E and how that might be changed compared to 2019.\nDouglas Howell: All right. Let me -- see if I can understand that again. I thought you had asked a question about India in there, or did I hear your word wrong?\nUnidentified Analyst: No. I guess -- no, I didn't say anything on India. It was the effect of lower T&E on margin expansion and then, how you're considering deploying T&E in the future maybe compared to 2019.\nDouglas Howell: All right. Great. Well, first of all, we have no hold on. If somebody wants to travel to see their clients where they're more than welcome to go do it, we have no restrictions on that. And people are self-governing on that. We will meet our clients wherever they would like us to meet them in order to conduct business with them. So, we are there and how they want to do it. How much is that? We probably have maybe $5 million a quarter of step-up from where we were in the past. So, maybe there's an extra $5 million in our first quarter, $5 million -- maybe we're at that $10 million this quarter, $15 million next, then $20 million next quarter relative to the depths of the pandemic. So, we're doing it. The good thing about this though, is that we are actually being able to bring our experts to the point of sale virtually much more now than we were before. So, remember the advantage that we have, and that is we have experts in every single aspect of insurance around the world. We can now drop that person into our customer's office, or even if they want to do it from home virtually. International folks, there's lots of -- there's conservative less international travel, but now we can bring our experts from London right into our terrific client or prospect in Des Moines, Iowa with the click of a button. So that's really the competitive advantage of that. But 90% of the time we compete with somebody smaller than us and they just don't have the expert.  So, when we can drop our expert in and bring those capabilities to bear, it's going to leave some more wins in the future. In the past to travel somebody in for a half hour meeting, that might be a two or three-day affair. So think about even though expenses might return to a certain extent, it's the ability to get our experts at the point of sale, or the point of -- to the prospect virtually that really is the terrific outcome from the pandemic.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That makes sense. I appreciate the answers.\nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. You may proceed with your question.\nRyan Tunis: Good evening, guys.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Good evening.\nRyan Tunis: First question, thinking about the second half of the year, about 9% organic, I think you mentioned, it\u2019s probably get 4% employee benefits. You spend a lot of visibility on how that's supposed to try -- I mean, how are you guys thinking about how that would fit into the 9% of the back half?\nDouglas Howell: I think there's a sequential step-up continuing in employee benefits like we've seen, as people come back we're really starting to -- just even in the last few weeks, our HR consulting units are starting to get more calls. We're starting to get as covered lives increase -- the number of participants and medical plans and dental plans is stepping up. So, it's four went to six and then went to eight over the next couple of quarters and it wouldn't surprise me in our employee benefit.\nRyan Tunis: Got it. And then, for Pat, can you just remind us why -- you guys do 40 deals a year, but very few of them seem to be a wholesale related. What do you mean by wholesale M&A? Why don't we see more of those?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: We're very active there. Ryan, I think it's just opportunistic. We've built RPS over the last 20 plus years in large part with acquisitions, and we've done some nice acquisitions over the last 12 months at RPS. One of the areas we built out, of course, we're the country's largest MGA. We also have a program business that's really strong, but open market brokers, we built the typical Gallagher way. We've recruited our own and built our own young people out of hardship. And we've done some very nice acquisitions there. So, no, there's no hole back there. And actually there's no real shortage of opportunities, a lot of competition, one of which at a very successful IPO this month.\nRyan Tunis: Gotcha. Okay. Cool. Thanks, guys.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nPhil Stefano: Yeah. Thanks. Good evening. Congrats on the quarter. I guess, I'm not sure how to put this in. I hope it's not offensive, but I know that the complaint I'm going to get tonight and then tomorrow is, the organic growth seems to be lagging peers. I understand the timing issue and with the contingent and the 606, but even at 9%, it feels like people are going to -- I suspect people are going to -- how do you want me to respond to this, as I'm looking conversations over the next day?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I think it's -- I'll let Doug give you the tactical side, Phil, because he's good at that, but let's put it this way. If you're dropping in the room, here's what I'd say. I'm really proud of our team. We had a great quarter and so did our competitors. God bless them. And if you take a look at our results over the past number of years versus anyone else you want to put up into that, our team gets up every morning and aggressively sells a lot of assurance. And so, I take no second stance to the fact that this quarter was anything, but outstanding. And one quarter comparables, doesn't get my dander up, Doug to give you more technical answer. But I think our people did a great job of selling insurance and holding on to our clients. And I'm really happy with the quarter. On a comparable basis, there's others that look stronger. I'm okay with that.\nDouglas Howell: Yeah. I think, Phil, one of the things you might want to do is take last year second quarter and this year second quarter for all of us, add them up and I think you might find that delta isn't all that much different. And like Pat said, so over two years, we're up about 10% organically in aggregate in our Brokerage segment. And again, I think that if you do the math on those that have reported are worth wherever your other insights are coming from. The second quarter and the second quarter -- last year this quarter might add up to about the same number. I think that running towards 9% is the best quarter since we've posted since fourth quarter of 2003. And like Pat said, this level of organic growth isn't an aberration just to one of us or two of us or whatever. The entire industry is showing excellent organic growth. Industry is growing at a much higher clip than GDP. And I guess what I would say is our outlook for the second half of the year is pretty bullish. So, that's how I would answer it, but mathematically take the two quarters together and we won't be all that far apart when you have like for like business.\nPhil Stefano: I guess, part of this comes back to -- if I think about the two year back that you're suggesting, it comes back to the idea that your clients were more persistent. And so, we don't get the ebb and the flow that we've seen in the recovery last year. I guess, is that a fair way to tie that commentary into the numbers?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: The other way I might put it, Phil, is we're doing a better job than our competition to mitigating the impact of rates for our clients.\nPhil Stefano: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Got it. When I think about the -- you said that the door is always open for talent that wants to come. As part of the agreement for the Willis potential businesses that were going to be acquired, was there any non-compete or no shop for talent provisions within that, that would keep you on the sideline from certain talent that might be wondering, looking around.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah. We have some limitations. We've agreed, of course, that we intend to honor those and they're not extensive. But generally speaking, we're not limited in our ability to hire general production talent. But of course, in that discussion, that transaction, there are some limitations which we intend on.\nPhil Stefano: Yeah. Okay. Perfect. Thanks. Congrats. And look, I think the margin expansion story over the past few years has been probably second to none. So, I hope -- hopefully that's the takeaway that you get from me and my comments tonight. Appreciate it.\nDouglas Howell: All right. Thanks Phil.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Laura. Let me just -- to make a few comments here. We delivered, obviously excellent second quarter. I'm extremely proud of our team. I believe that we are in the best business in the world, and we're delivering significant value for our clients around the globe day-in and day-out. Thank you all for being with us this evening, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks very much. Thank you, Laura.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation for the rest of your evening.",

            "name": "Douglas Howell",
            "content": "Thanks Pat and hello everyone. As Pat said, an excellent quarter and first half of the year. Today, I'll spend a little extra time on organic and then give you our current thinking on expenses and margins. Then, I'll walk you through some of the items on our CFO commentary document, and I'll finish up with some comments on cash, liquidity and capital management. Okay. Let's move to page four of the earnings release and the Brokerage segment organic table. Headline all in organic of 6.8%, excellent on its own, but as pat said, really running closer to 9%. There's two reasons for that. First, recall that we had some favorable timing in our first quarter related to contingent commissions that caused a little unfavorable timing here in the second quarter, call that 70 basis points. Second, also recall that we took our 606 revenue accounting adjustment in the first quarter of 2020, we then adjusted that in the second quarter of 2020. So that creates a more difficult compare this year second quarter, call that about 150 basis points. These two items combined for about 220 basis points of a headwind here in the second quarter. We don't expect similar headwinds in the second half. Okay. Let's go to page six to the Brokerage adjusted EBITDAC table. You'll see that we expanded our EBITDAC margin by 23 basis points here in the second quarter. Considering last year second quarter was in the depth of the pandemic and our Brokerage segment save $60 million in that quarter to post any expansion at all this quarter is terrific work by the team, shows we are indeed holding a lot of our savings. So, the natural question is, when you levelize for the $60 million of pandemic savings last year second quarter, and about $15 million of cost that came back this second quarter, what was the underlying margin expansion? Answer to that is about 125 basis points, which on 6.8% organic feels about right. That $15 million mostly relates to higher utilization of our self-insurance medical plans, a modest pickup in T&E expenses and incentive comp. So, we held $45 million of cost savings this quarter. And that's really terrific. Looking forward, we continue to think we can hold a lot of our pandemic period savings, perhaps more than half, but naturally some of those costs will come back. As of now we think about $20 million of costs returned in the third quarter and $30 million return in the fourth quarter, both of those numbers are relative to last year same quarters. So, again, the natural question might be, what organic do you need to post third and fourth quarter to overcome those expenses and still have margin expansion? Math would say about 7%, which is really the real story. Recall at the beginning of the year, after expanding margins 420 basis points in 2020, we were looking at just holding margins flat. Thanks, Elyse So, did you take the entire $15 million out of OpEx or did you spread some of that into comp and then also did you factor in M&A, but you're not far off of it, being pretty close to flat when you factor in M&A. Yeah. I think there was -- I guess I think the $20 million will come back in the third quarter of expensive, and I think $30 million will come back in the fourth quarter. That will be split some between OpEx and some between compensation. But by and large, our underlying costs, other than maybe in the IT areas, we're starting to see savings in real estate. We're starting to see savings in professional fees. We are seeing increases in travel and entertainment expenses because some of our clients are expecting us to be there and we're happy to be there for it. But you are seeing some good learnings from the pandemic. We have pretty well taken care of all of our incoming, outgoing mail. It's saving some costs there, so we can centralize that so we can deploy mail anywhere around the world with the touch of a button. So, there are some good projects that have been going on to -- that we're continuing to harvest out of the operating expense line. Yeah. Let's level set. We were saving, let's say -- let's call it $65 million a quarter during the pandemic. And we think that we can hold $30 million of that -- $35 million of that. So, again, back to -- I don't know where your 150 came from, unless it was 60 times, four or five -- four and a half, and then divided by two. But where'd you get the 150 from? Okay. What do you mean end markets? Our employee benefits business, you see a lot of headline recovery in employment stats that generally are citing retail, hospitality, transportation -- travel related industries. Our customer base is not concentrated in those industries. It's more diverse than that. And it's just the return to work and our customer base isn't quite at those headline returning to work numbers you see there. That what you're asking about, Mark? Nothing, it's just the mix of business down in the benefits business. We're seeing a little bit. I think that there's a little bit of -- I think the larger account market or larger size market, we saw increases in premiums there that were a little higher than, let's say, the mid-market of a smaller market throughout the end of 2020 and here in the first half of 2021. So, we're just not seeing if a large account market is not growing rates quite as fast as they were in the past. We're not really seeing that as much in the mid-market. We are seeing it more consistent with first quarter and fourth quarter. You lose there, Mark? Yeah. Absolutely. That's cash in the bank right now. We think that, that -- and we might have to borrow a little bit more towards the end of the year for part of next year, depending on how the M&A pipeline looks at, but the $650 million there's a special mandatory redemption feature in there. So, we'll pay that back. And then what happened with the $850 million that we raised along with that, that -- we'll get that to work here in the second half of the year. You might have a little that end, but I think it will put -- truthfully, I think that it might put -- pricing might stay the same and it actually might pull forward a little bit less on an earn-out and more up front. So you put it here in this year, you might feel bad. Is it a full turn on the multiple, maybe to accelerate it, not have as much on that earn-out, but I wouldn't say it's going to cause a big decrease in pricing. All right. Let me -- see if I can understand that again. I thought you had asked a question about India in there, or did I hear your word wrong? All right. Great. Well, first of all, we have no hold on. If somebody wants to travel to see their clients where they're more than welcome to go do it, we have no restrictions on that. And people are self-governing on that. We will meet our clients wherever they would like us to meet them in order to conduct business with them. So, we are there and how they want to do it. How much is that? We probably have maybe $5 million a quarter of step-up from where we were in the past. So, maybe there's an extra $5 million in our first quarter, $5 million -- maybe we're at that $10 million this quarter, $15 million next, then $20 million next quarter relative to the depths of the pandemic. So, we're doing it. The good thing about this though, is that we are actually being able to bring our experts to the point of sale virtually much more now than we were before. So, remember the advantage that we have, and that is we have experts in every single aspect of insurance around the world. We can now drop that person into our customer's office, or even if they want to do it from home virtually. International folks, there's lots of -- there's conservative less international travel, but now we can bring our experts from London right into our terrific client or prospect in Des Moines, Iowa with the click of a button. So that's really the competitive advantage of that. But 90% of the time we compete with somebody smaller than us and they just don't have the expert.  So, when we can drop our expert in and bring those capabilities to bear, it's going to leave some more wins in the future. In the past to travel somebody in for a half hour meeting, that might be a two or three-day affair. So think about even though expenses might return to a certain extent, it's the ability to get our experts at the point of sale, or the point of -- to the prospect virtually that really is the terrific outcome from the pandemic. Thanks, Alex. I think there's a sequential step-up continuing in employee benefits like we've seen, as people come back we're really starting to -- just even in the last few weeks, our HR consulting units are starting to get more calls. We're starting to get as covered lives increase -- the number of participants and medical plans and dental plans is stepping up. So, it's four went to six and then went to eight over the next couple of quarters and it wouldn't surprise me in our employee benefit. Yeah. I think, Phil, one of the things you might want to do is take last year second quarter and this year second quarter for all of us, add them up and I think you might find that delta isn't all that much different. And like Pat said, so over two years, we're up about 10% organically in aggregate in our Brokerage segment. And again, I think that if you do the math on those that have reported are worth wherever your other insights are coming from. The second quarter and the second quarter -- last year this quarter might add up to about the same number. I think that running towards 9% is the best quarter since we've posted since fourth quarter of 2003. And like Pat said, this level of organic growth isn't an aberration just to one of us or two of us or whatever. The entire industry is showing excellent organic growth. Industry is growing at a much higher clip than GDP. And I guess what I would say is our outlook for the second half of the year is pretty bullish. So, that's how I would answer it, but mathematically take the two quarters together and we won't be all that far apart when you have like for like business. All right. Thanks Phil."

            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had an excellent second quarter. The team delivered on all four of our long-term operating priorities to drive shareholder value. We grew organically. We grew through acquisitions, improved our productivity all while raising our quality and maintaining our unique Gallagher culture. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 17% growth in revenue, 8.6% organic growth, but it's over 10% when adjusted for timing, which Doug will spend some time on in a few minutes. Net earnings margin expansion of 107 basis points, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 30 basis points. And we completed eight new mergers in the quarter, with more than $70 million of estimated annualized revenue. Most importantly, our Gallagher culture continues to thrive. Just a fantastic quarter on all measures. Now, before I discuss how each of our businesses performed in more detail, let me comment briefly about the termination of our agreement to purchase certain Willis Towers Watson brokerage operations. We were excited about the opportunity. We would have loved to complete the transaction. There are a lot of great people at Willis and they would have been a great addition to our team. But here's the key point. With or without this, we remained very well-positioned to support our clients, compete for new ones and ultimately drive value for all of our stakeholders. We're in the greatest business on earth. Our culture is stronger than ever, and I'm excited about our future.  Okay. Back to our quarterly results. Starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was strong at 16%, of that 6.8% was organic revenue growth, a little better than our June IR Day expectation and closer to 9% adjusted for timing. Our net earnings margin moved higher by 53 basis points and our adjusted EBITDAC margin expanded by 23 basis points, highlighting our continued expense discipline. Another excellent quarter from the Brokerage team. Thanks Doug. Laura, I think we take some questions now. Good evening. Yeah. Elyse, I think you might be a little strong on that, based on the math. So, just take a look at it again. I think why are math produced more like, towards 9%. No, I think as we sit right now, our intent is to repurchase the $1.5 billion. We think we can get that done in short order also and certainly by the end of the year. Now the point here is that we're -- we won't let access capital sip idle by any means. Yeah. I think, what I was doing is using the illustration of saying if we post 7% for the full year, you'd see about a 100 basis points of margin expansion, even with those costs coming back into our structure. And clearly if we better 7%, we should be able to better that too. Sure. Okay. So, new business was stronger than where we were, same second quarter or for also say the year new business range stronger. Retention is about the same, getting lift from rate and exposure that when we combine that together, right now I think it's about 50/50. rate and 50% exposure. Good afternoon, Mark. No. I just -- from where I sit, Mark, when I'm talking to people in the field and when I'm talking to our underwriting partners, there just doesn't seem to be any appetite for cutting. Now rate of increase is down, but I'm not seeing people say, oh gosh, we've got this thing right. Let's open the flood gates. Well, no. We don't. But as you know, Mark, you follow us a long time. Our organic hiring is a big part of our strategy and there's no doubt that we're going to continue to hire production talent across all the lines of business that we've got. And our doors of all -- even in the depths of the soft market, as you followed us, the doors open for production talent. Thanks Mark. No, there's a lot of competition for deals out there. It's coming up every time. No. We're good at tuck-ins. By the way, looks also, Greg knows this very well. If in fact there's 39,000 agents and brokers in America, let's remember that business insurance that just brought out it's a July edition this month number 100 was $25 million in revenue. So the playing field is full of really, really good tuck-in players. Good evening. We're very active there. Ryan, I think it's just opportunistic. We've built RPS over the last 20 plus years in large part with acquisitions, and we've done some nice acquisitions over the last 12 months at RPS. One of the areas we built out, of course, we're the country's largest MGA. We also have a program business that's really strong, but open market brokers, we built the typical Gallagher way. We've recruited our own and built our own young people out of hardship. And we've done some very nice acquisitions there. So, no, there's no hole back there. And actually there's no real shortage of opportunities, a lot of competition, one of which at a very successful IPO this month. Thanks, Ryan. Well, I think it's -- I'll let Doug give you the tactical side, Phil, because he's good at that, but let's put it this way. If you're dropping in the room, here's what I'd say. I'm really proud of our team. We had a great quarter and so did our competitors. God bless them. And if you take a look at our results over the past number of years versus anyone else you want to put up into that, our team gets up every morning and aggressively sells a lot of assurance. And so, I take no second stance to the fact that this quarter was anything, but outstanding. And one quarter comparables, doesn't get my dander up, Doug to give you more technical answer. But I think our people did a great job of selling insurance and holding on to our clients. And I'm really happy with the quarter. On a comparable basis, there's others that look stronger. I'm okay with that. The other way I might put it, Phil, is we're doing a better job than our competition to mitigating the impact of rates for our clients. Yeah. We have some limitations. We've agreed, of course, that we intend to honor those and they're not extensive. But generally speaking, we're not limited in our ability to hire general production talent. But of course, in that discussion, that transaction, there are some limitations which we intend on. Thanks, Laura. Let me just -- to make a few comments here. We delivered, obviously excellent second quarter. I'm extremely proud of our team. I believe that we are in the best business in the world, and we're delivering significant value for our clients around the globe day-in and day-out. Thank you all for being with us this evening, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thanks very much. Thank you, Laura."

It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. What a fantastic quarter. We executed against our four long-term operating priorities to drive shareholder value: first, we grew organically; second, we grew through acquisitions; third, we improved our productivity while raising our quality; and fourth, we continue to reap the benefits of our unique Gallagher culture. I\u2019m extremely proud of how our team continues to execute and deliver world-class expertise and service day-in and day-out. We\u2019re off to a great start in 2021. So, let me give you some more detail on the quarter, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth of 12.2%, of that, 6% was organic revenue growth, better than our recent IR Day expectations, thanks to an excellent March. Our cost containment efforts saved about $60 million in the quarter, helping drive our net earnings margin higher by 94 basis points and expand our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 480 basis points and net earnings were up 17% and adjusted EBITDAC was up 24%, an excellent quarter from the Brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and give you some soundbites about each of our Brokerage units, starting with our P/C operations. In the U.S., retail organic growth was strong at about 5%. New business was excellent and retention remains strong. In our U.S. wholesale operations, Risk Placement Services organic was about 6%. Open brokerage organic was 15% due to rate increases, higher levels of new business and improved retention. Our MGA program\u2019s binding businesses were up about 4%. Retention in new business were similar to the first quarter of 2020. However, we did see a little bit more tailwind from rate and exposure during the quarter. Moving to the UK, over 7% organic for the quarter. In both our retail and specialty operations, new business was up over prior year while retention held pretty steady. Australia and New Zealand combined posted organic of 3%. New business and retention were both similar to prior year. And finally, our Canadian retail operations, excellent organic of 13%, fantastic new business and rate all added to our stellar performance again this quarter. So overall, our global P/C operations posted more than 7% organic, which is better than the 5% to 6% we discussed at our Investor Day, thanks to a really strong March. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. First quarter organic was up slightly, which is better than our March IR Day expectations. Revenue from our traditional health and welfare business held up well, while fees from consulting arrangements, special project work and our life business were up slightly. So when I bring P/C and Benefits together, total Brokerage segment organic was 6%, a really strong start to the year. Next, I\u2019d like to make a few comments on the P/C market, starting with the rate environment. Global P/C rates remain firm overall and the increases we saw during the first quarter of 2021 are consistent with the past couple of quarters. Rates in Canada led the way, up double digits, driven by property and professional liability. In the U.S., rates were up about 7%, including double-digit rate increases within our wholesale open brokerage operations. Our UK retail and London specialty operations combined, rates are up about 5%. And finally, Australia and New Zealand combined, rate increases are in the low single digits. At the same time, capacity is constrained in certain lines and carriers are pushing for tighter terms and conditions. There are also quite a few pockets in the U.S., Canada and London specialty market that I would describe as hard such as cat-exposed properties, cyber, umbrella and public company D&O, just to name a few. So the global P/C environment remains difficult but is giving us some tailwinds. Looking forward, we don\u2019t see conditions that would indicate this rate environment will change anytime soon, and we are seeing more and more economic activity across our client base. For example, customers are adding coverages and exposures to their existing policies. And through yesterday, April endorsements, premium audits and other midterm policy adjustments are a net positive overall. That, too, is an encouraging sign. On the benefits side, a recovering labor market in 2021 should favorably impact our core health and welfare business. And we remain optimistic that we will start to see some incremental HR consulting and special project work. This is a terrific time for our team to shine, firm global rates, increasing exposure units and recovering employment. Our clients need our expertise and we are there with the very best insurance, consulting and risk management advice. So while there\u2019s a lot of year left, I have greater conviction that our full year 2021 Brokerage segment organic will be equal to or perhaps even better than pre-pandemic 2019 organic. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We finished the first quarter with five completed brokerage mergers, representing about $90 million of estimated annualized revenues. I\u2019d like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in M&A pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing about $250 million of annualized revenues. Our global platform is a great fit for savvy and successful entrepreneurs. We have the tools, data, products, niche expertise and carrier relationships to help these owners support their current clients and take their business to the next level. Next, I\u2019d like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was 0.6%, which is in line with our March IR Day expectations of about flat. It was still a tough compare to pre-pandemic first quarter 2020. However, there is no doubt we are starting to see more and more core workers\u2019 comp claim activity when compared to what we were seeing last year at this time. Traditional workers\u2019 comp claims are returning and we are seeing fewer and fewer COVID-related claims. Our cost containment efforts paid off again this quarter. We saved around $4 million and expanded our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 180 basis points to 18.4%, another great quarter of execution by the Gallagher Bassett team. Looking forward to the next three quarters, we would expect new claims arising to be higher than what we saw last year, perhaps not back to pre-pandemic levels quite yet but certainly higher than last year. So when I combine that with some really nice new business wins, we should be back to seeing organic in the upper single digits for the next few quarters. That would also bode well for keeping margins above 18% for the remainder of the year. Let me wrap up with some comments regarding our unique Gallagher culture. It\u2019s a culture that emphasizes doing things the right way for the right reasons with the right people. It\u2019s a culture of service, service to our clients, to one another and to the communities where we work and where we live and our culture continues to be recognized externally. Just last week, Forbes named Gallagher one of the best U.S. employers for diversity and that\u2019s on top of Gallagher being recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world\u2019s most ethical companies for the 10th year in a row, 10 straight years, and once again, the sole insurance broker recognized. These recognitions are a direct reflection of our more than 30,000 global colleagues working together as a team guided by the 25 tenets of the Gallagher Way. Culture is a key differentiator for our franchise. Every day, all of our people get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture, to live our culture, and I believe our culture has never been stronger. Doug, over to you.\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll echo Pat\u2019s comments, an excellent quarter and a terrific start to the year. Today, I\u2019ll spend most of my time on both our cost savings initiatives and our clean energy cash flows, then highlight a few items in our CFO commentary document, and I\u2019ll close with some comments on M&A, cash and liquidity. Before I plunge in on cost, one quick comment on Page 3 in the Brokerage segment organic table. You\u2019ll see that we had a great quarter for contingent commissions. There is a little bit of favorable timing in there, call it about 50 basis points on total organic. That will flip the other way next quarter but regardless, a really solid quarter. Okay, let\u2019s go to Page 5, the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. You\u2019ll see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by $122 million over last year\u2019s first quarter, resulting in about 480 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. That would have been closer to 550 basis points, but as we discussed in our March IR Day, M&A roll-in isn\u2019t as seasonally large, and we did strengthen bonus a bit, given our outlook for 2021 as considerably more optimistic today than it was last year at this time standing at the gates of a global pandemic. Within that $122 million of EBITDAC growth is about $60 million that is directly related to our cost savings initiatives, call that about 370 basis points of margin expansion. So when controlling for these three items, we see underlying margin expansion of about 180 basis points on that 6% all-in organic, once again, absolutely terrific execution by the team. Moving on to the Risk Management segment on Page 6. We grew adjusted EBITDAC by $4.3 million, resulting in about 180 basis points of adjusted margin expansion, leading us to post margins nicely over 18%. Most of that was due to our cost savings initiatives. So when I combine our Brokerage and Risk Management segments, savings were around $64 million, pretty similar to the last three quarters and that consists of: reduced travel, entertainment and advertising, about $25 million; reduced consulting and professional fees, about $15 million; reduced outside labor and other workforce costs, about $15 million; and then reduced office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs of about another $9 million. But remember, first quarter 2021 is the last quarter we have a favorable comparison to pre-pandemic spend levels. So now it\u2019s all about how much of the cost savings we can hold going forward. As I look at it today, I still believe we will hold a lot of it. As we have said before, we do see certain costs coming back but that won\u2019t happen overnight. Our best guess is maybe $15 million coming back in the second quarter 2021, then step that up by about $5 million to $7 million in the third quarter and a similar step-up again in the fourth quarter. Those amounts that I\u2019ve given are relative to 2020 same quarters adjusted for the roll-in impact of M&A. As for how that translates into margins, that\u2019s really dependent on where we land on organic, but say you assume organic is around 5% or above for the remainder of the year, the math would say that would be enough to show some full year margin expansion and regardless of where we land, let\u2019s keep this in perspective for the longer term. The pandemic has allowed and perhaps even forced us to accelerate a lot of the improvements we had on the drawing board and also served as an opportunity to design new and better ways to run our business. Both of these make us more productive today than we were 15 months ago and our service quality has even improved. This will provide a lasting benefit for years to come. So let\u2019s move now to the CFO commentary document we posted on our investor website. On Page 3, most items are very similar to what we provided at our March IR Day. On Page 4, both clean energy and the corporate line came in better than we had provided in March. The corporate line is just timing between first and third quarters for certain tax items. But the clean energy investments had a much better quarter and we bumped up our full year estimate. It\u2019s now looking like $70 million to $80 million of full year after-tax earnings, which is really good news. Next, flip to Page 5 of the CFO commentary. If you missed the clean energy vignette that I gave during our March IR Day, it might be worth to listen to the replay on our website, starts with the hour and 9-minute mark. Here are the punchlines: First, recall, 2021 is the last year of what we call the credit generation era; second, 2022 will be the first meaningful year in the cash harvesting era. This means 2021 is the last year we will report GAAP earnings, and 2022 will be the first year meaningful cash flows show up in our cash flow statement. You\u2019ll see here on Page 5 that we think 2022 annual cash flows could increase by around $125 million to $150 million. And finally, this is not a one year benefit to cash flow. We have more than $1 billion of tax credit carryforwards on our balance sheet that should favorably impact cash flows for the next six to seven years. As for M&A capacity, at March 31, available cash on hand was more than $400 million, and we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. So with cash on hand, our untapped borrowing capacity and another year of strong cash flows, it means upwards of $2.5 billion of M&A capacity here in 2021. With a nice M&A pipeline, we are in good shape to continue with our tuck-in strategy. Before I pass it back to Pat, and that was a mouthful, as I sit here today, I see a lot of positives. Organic has nice tailwinds from rate and exposure growth. Add to that a lot of pent-up consumer demand and perhaps a wave of governmental spending. Both could be additional growth catalysts. We have a robust M&A pipeline that should continue to grow, especially if an increase in capital gains tax gets momentum and we\u2019ve learned a lot from the pandemic on how to operate better, faster and cheaper, all the while improving service quality and our productivity gains we achieved over the last year appear to be sticky. This all bodes well for another year of strong cash flow generation, with a kicker starting in 2022 from our clean energy investment. So, we are very well positioned operationally and financially. I can feel the excitement out in the field about coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever before. It\u2019s setting up to be another great year. Back to you, Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Doug. Laura, I think we can go to some questions and answers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi, Elyse.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. My first question is on organic. You guys printed 6% in the quarter. As I look to your comments, you said perhaps you get back to where we were in 2019, which is also 6%. But if you think about what\u2019s going on today, you pointed to still strong P&C pricing and the economy is getting better. So what would cause the forward three quarters of this year to not be stronger? Like do you see anything decelerating or is it just there\u2019s some conservatism in that outlook for things to kind of stay stable over the rest of the year?\nDoug Howell: I think it depends on the recovery pattern. I think there\u2019s still a lot of unemployment in there, and we\u2019re running somewhere in that 5.5% to 6% range right now. We\u2019re going to hold that for the rest of the year. It looks like it could be a pretty good year. So there\u2019s nothing inherently different today in that thinking other than it feels kind of like 2019.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Our clients are doing much better, Elyse. I think they are coming back to 2019, not surging beyond it.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay and then in terms of the margin, right, you guys had alluded to 400 basis points of margin expansion at your IR event, and that came 80 basis points above but we still had the headwind you were alluding to. So what was better, I guess, relative to the IR Day within the margin? Was it the contingence on supplemental? Or was it just kind of the core margin expansion away from the save which is better than you were thinking?\nDoug Howell: It was a contingent commission that came in better, primarily fueled that.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay and then on the M&A side of things, you pointed to an active pipeline in terms of tuck-ins. There\u2019s obviously a pretty big merger between Aon and Willis that \u2013 where they\u2019re working toward their regulatory approvals and I\u2019m not sure if you can comment on it. Obviously a lot of speculation in the press in terms of what may or may not be divested. But as you guys think about larger deals, could you just give us a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about, I guess, potentially on the M&A side, if there are properties that could become available there to the divestment process and things that could potentially be attractive to Gallagher.\nDoug Howell: Right. So there\u2019s a lot to unpack in that. I\u2019ll hit the capacity. We have up to $2.5 billion worth of M&A capacity this year and we\u2019ve got a full pipeline of nice tuck-in acquisitions that are out there. In terms of what comes out of the Aon and Willis opportunity, we read the same things that you\u2019re reading and we just typically don\u2019t comment on acquisitions that we hear about in the papers, but we\u2019ve got $2.5 billion and we like our tuck-in merger strategy.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question.\nGreg Peters: Good afternoon.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hey Greg.\nGreg Peters: So I just want to turn around the discussion on M&A. Can you go back and revisit sort of the process that evolved and emerged when you guys were doing the JLT global aerospace deal in 2019? Was it a 3-month process? Was it a one-month process? And I guess, ultimately, what we\u2019re getting at is or I\u2019m going with is there\u2019s some pretty strong time line issues with Aon and Willis Towers Watson. And I guess some of your investors might be concerned that you, in an effort to meet their time lines, not that you\u2019re doing anything, but you might sacrifice your due diligence, if that makes sense.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Greg, I\u2019ll take a shot at that. We did the Arrow deal in London in pretty short order. We\u2019re really happy with that acquisition. It turned out to be terrific. We didn\u2019t seem to sacrifice anything.\nGreg Peters: Okay and so one of the other areas that you referenced is culture. Maybe you can go back to the acquisitions, the large acquisitions you did in New Zealand and Australia and talk to us a little bit how you were able to ensure the continuity of your culture when you\u2019re doing large deals.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I think in that situation, you had very good strong stand-alone businesses that we could, in fact, get to meet the leadership of. I think you remember the story. We did fly to Australia, met leadership and gave them the choice. They were planning on going public in their own right. We met two leaders with \u2013 the entire top leadership. And basically, that evening said, \"You\u2019ve got a choice to make. You want to go public on your own or do you want to join us?\" Steve Lockwood, who\u2019s still with us, had that decision to make. I think he made a pretty good decision. Things are going great.\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think, Greg, on that one, in particular, too, is that \u2013 and this seems odd for the accountant to say this, but when you \u2013 on that deal, it was owned by an industrial conglomerate that really didn\u2019t view brokerage as being its priority, insurance brokerage and I\u2019ve got to say, for the way our sales leadership and our operational leadership came down to Australia, combined with Steve\u2019s relentless focus on sales, we really \u2013 it was really the Australia business that needed a positive shot in the arm when it comes to embracing and supporting a sales culture and we think that what works at Gallagher are people that want to come in and sell insurance and we\u2019ve worked hard over the number of years to show that we\u2019re a broker run by brokers and so we like to sell insurance and that is the culture that we think really, really was the secret sauce to taking \u2013 it was running negative 7% organic in Australia when we bought it and we think we did a terrific job. It\u2019s posting nice organic year in and year out since that \u2013 since we did that.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Canada, our Canadian operation was running negative organic as well.\nGreg Peters: Well, the accountant didn\u2019t do too bad with his answer. So I\u2019ll pivot to...\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Remember, he\u2019s been around 20 years, Greg.\nGreg Peters: Yes, I\u2019m well aware. I\u2019d like to pivot to the operations. Just the two things that stuck out. The employee benefits business clearly is still \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say struggling but it hasn\u2019t rebounded the way it was pre-pandemic. Can you \u2013 is there any ASC 606 issues as we think about the first quarter results relative to the year before? Or is there \u2013 is it expected that as we move through the year, there could be some benefit in that if the economies do recover?\nDoug Howell: There\u2019s nothing noteworthy on 606 in the numbers, what could happen in the future. If you had a substantial recovery in covered lives compared to our estimates \u2013 covered lives compared to our estimates today, you could see some upside development in those estimates for the rest of this year. As you know, all that employee benefits business or most of it is a 1/1 renewal. We have to make our estimate of covered lives. And if there was a substantial surge in employment, it would probably pull up those estimates a little bit over the next three quarters as that develops.\nGreg Peters: Got it. You know I feel like I\u2019ve hogged enough of your time. I\u2019ll let others ask their questions. Thanks for the answers.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. You may proceed with your question.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi, good evening.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi David.\nDavid Motemaden: I had a question, just following up on the benefits business and hoping to maybe get a bit more granular detail just in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about organic throughout the rest of the year and specifically, I know you spoke about, in your response to the previous question, just about your estimates about covered lives and what those do for the year. So I\u2019m wondering what your expectations are for the rest of the year just for covered lives, like what\u2019s baked in that statement that you\u2019re assuming we can get back to 2019 organic levels here in 2021?\nDoug Howell: Yes. So our assumptions in the 606 estimates are not substantial recovery in covered lives, different than where our brokers place the business as they put that to rest here in January. So there isn\u2019t a substantial uptick in expectation. Also on that point, remember, that business didn\u2019t fall off the cliff last year because the employers that we do are pretty stable employers and so while we didn\u2019t have a substantial decrease in covered lives last year, and so I wouldn\u2019t expect a substantial recovery of that for the rest of the year. So kind of flat where they renewed is what our expectations were used when we set that reserve \u2013 that estimate.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Where we see some opportunity to grow back is the fee business. That business was just \u2013 it was slammed shut at the end of the first quarter last year and those are projects that need to be done. They need professionals to do them, and I think that there will be some more demand there.\nDoug Howell: I mean the workforce talent is coming back, so, I think that\u2019s \u2013 and that\u2019s where we excel and that is helping employers with that.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. No, that\u2019s helpful and I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but did you talk about how that\u2019s trending thus far in the second quarter just on the consulting arrangements?\nDoug Howell: We didn\u2019t comment but we\u2019re happy to. Not a substantial difference sitting here on April 29, as we saw, let\u2019s say, on March 29. But there is \u2013 there are some green shoots. Our consultants are getting some more calls so I think that you\u2019ll see a little bit more active summer and fall.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Let\u2019s hope.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. No, that\u2019s helpful and then maybe just stepping back, a bigger picture question. Sort of on the M&A theme but I\u2019m just sort of \u2013 I\u2019m wondering just how you guys are thinking about broader acquisitions as opposed to team lift-outs and sort of how you weigh both potential. Very similar ways of growth but obviously different in terms of the way the financials work. So just wondering how you think about both of those avenues.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes. Let me be real clear, David. I think these players in the market, they want to ignore contracts, lift teams, litigate and call that a cheaper way to get talent. Let me see if I can clean up my comments. I don\u2019t like that. We like to see people that have built companies, entrepreneurial in nature, have a culture, respect their clients, respect their people and sell ongoing enterprises to us. Do we recruit individual people? Absolutely. And do we bring teams across? Yes, we do. But the other method isn\u2019t for us.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Yup. That makes sense. That\u2019s all that I have. I\u2019ll let others ask their questions in the queue. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks David\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist. You may proceed with your question.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi Mark.\nMark Hughes: Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi Mark.\nMark Hughes: Hello. Hey, on the Risk Management business, I\u2019ll ask a question about claims. You say that year-over-year, clearly, frequency or claims counts are going to be up. But it sounds like Q4 and Q1 and maybe even so far in Q2 are holding relatively steady. Is that the right way to think about that?\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think there\u2019s a little bit of a crossover here, Mark. As COVID claims started to decline, we started to see regular workers\u2019 comp claim go up. You\u2019ll have a little bit of that in the second quarter but not much. I think the COVID claims are pretty well through our process at this point, and then the regular workers\u2019 comp claims will far exceed that going forward. So that might be what you\u2019re seeing in that number.\nMark Hughes: On just the pricing environment, there\u2019s some talk of moderation. You all seem to be pretty consistent that the trends are holding steady, similar rates of increase. I think in the text, you might have pointed to higher rates of increase in the second quarter. Are you seeing any sort of moderation?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No, we\u2019re not. I think we\u2019re seeing consistent demand for proper pricing. We\u2019ve been a couple of years now into some hardening numbers. So I do think that over time, that will moderate but we\u2019re not seeing any lack of discipline in the market at this point and underwriters are continuing to ask for increases.\nDoug Howell: Yes. When you look at the dollar \u2013 the year-over-year dollar-over-dollar increases, the dollars are still going up. The rate or the percentage might not be as big because you\u2019re on a bigger base, but there\u2019s still rate increases happening everywhere. Even workers\u2019 comp is getting rate at this point.\nMark Hughes: Then Doug, any green shoots about extending the clean energy legislation?\nDoug Howell: There\u2019s a lot of infrastructure packages out there, and I think that there\u2019s opportunity to realize this process does contribute some pretty good value to the environment. So there\u2019s always hope. If we get an opportunity to \u2013 in the infrastructure package or in the tax reconciliation process that might come through, there\u2019s always hope on that.\nMark Hughes: Thank you.\nDoug Howell: Sure.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nYaron Kinar: Hi, good afternoon everybody. My first question on the contingent commissions. If I\u2019m doing my math correct, I think I get to like 120 basis points or so of margin expansion coming from contingents. Does that resonate?\nDoug Howell: What did you assume as the margin on it?\nYaron Kinar: About 70%.\nDoug Howell: Yes, it might be a little thick. I mean a lot of the contingent commissions go to \u2013 when it comes to the leadership variable comp, there\u2019s a piece of that that fuels it. So 70% might be a little rich, but some of it, yes, maybe 100 basis points, maybe not 120.\nYaron Kinar: Okay, OK. So you got like 60 basis points of, call it, organic margin expansion, 100 coming from contingents and the rest coming from cost saves, if I wanted to divide it into buckets?\nDoug Howell: Probably almost a point from regular trough then \u2013 and when you take out the contingents and you can\u2019t take out the margin from that.\nYaron Kinar: Okay, OK. That\u2019s helpful and did I hear you say that you\u2019re switching over to cash EPS in 2022?\nDoug Howell: No. I think what I was saying is that in the clean energy segment, you\u2019re going to start seeing $120 million to \u2013 $125 million to $150 million of additional cash flows that will come through our cash flow statement. We\u2019ll obviously make sure that we call that out every quarter on how much is that because it\u2019s the rundown of that deferred tax asset that sits on our balance sheet that moves from being a noncash asset into a cash asset. So we\u2019ll make sure we highlight it as we go forward.\nYaron Kinar: Got it, OK. Thank you very much and congrats on the quarter.\nDoug Howell: Thanks.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. You may proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. I guess the big dumb question that I\u2019m struggling with is that if we\u2019re seeing rate increases hold flat and we assume that the economy comes back, wouldn\u2019t that point to organic growth on a year-over-year basis well above 5%?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hope so.\nDoug Howell: Part of that, though too, is remember, our job is to help our client structure programs that actually mitigate some of the rate increase. It\u2019s hard to mitigate exposure growth unless you want to take more deductibles or lower limits. Rate increases, there\u2019s some \u2013 you can do the same thing, but if somebody adds two or three more trucks, you\u2019ve got to insure those other two or three more trucks. So if exposure units overtake the recovery from rate on that, the programs that we designed, you\u2019d see more of that hitting the bottom line. But if it\u2019s just purely rate, you can mitigate some of that through different program structure.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and then if I can dig just a little deeper on the claims \u2013 the workers\u2019 compensation claims that you\u2019re seeing in the trends. Is there a material difference to your revenues when you\u2019re handling traditional work comp claims versus COVID?\nDoug Howell: Well, there\u2019s two different \u2013 there\u2019s different pieces and there\u2019s the liability piece and then there\u2019s the medical-only piece in traditional workers\u2019 comp. I think that the longer-tail liability type workers\u2019 comp claim is more profitable to us than just the kind of the recurring medical-only claims, where we\u2019re basically paying the bills on it. So you would see that \u2013 you would \u2013 the revenues that come off of a liability-related workers\u2019 comp claim would probably exceed the COVID claims.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Good. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks a lot.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks Meyer.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Phil Stefano with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nPhil Stefano: Yes, thanks and good evening. Just a few quick ones. Most have been asked and answered. But \u2013 so as we think about the appropriate base for our margin for first quarter 2022, is it the 39.2% that was printed? Or should we make some kind of adjustment for the margin benefit from the contingents and supplementals?\nDoug Howell: Okay. So you\u2019re asking about a year from now in first quarter 2022?\nPhil Stefano: No it would...\nDoug Howell: I\u2019ll help you think that out a second here as I think that, yes, when you look at our 39.2%, the base should probably start from \u2013 you heard the earlier question. We probably got a little lift from contingent commissions in that number, so you want to start off a little bit lower base and let\u2019s say by then, we\u2019re holding half of our savings, long-term savings compared to where we are today. Maybe there\u2019s $30 million worth of costs that are back into the structure by that time and spread that across $1.8 billion or $1.9 billion. That\u2019s probably the right way to think about next year.\nPhil Stefano: Okay, but it\u2019s fair to say any of this lumpy stuff should probably be normalized for.\nDoug Howell: Say that again, I\u2019m sorry.\nPhil Stefano: It\u2019s fair to say that \u2013 I mean the lumpy kind of impacts like a contingent over-earning, we should probably normalize for that as we think about the forward margin.\nDoug Howell: Yes, I think so. Yes.\nPhil Stefano: Okay, all right. Perfect and then from the Risk Management segment, I guess, there was a comment around it being in the upper single digits for the next few quarters. Is the right way to think about this year-over-year or sequentially? I guess in my mind, when I think about your comment about claim counts being kind of flattish fourth quarter to first quarter, it feels like that\u2019s reflected in the revenues and as we think about claim counts expanding with the economy opening back up, I guess, maybe 2021 is kind of one of the businesses where I look at this sequentially as opposed to on a year-over-year basis. Is that off base?\nDoug Howell: Either way, as long as you understand that last year\u2019s second quarter there was a trough and there will be some recovery out of it this year relative to that quarter, but if you\u2019re basing it off the last two quarters and want to do a run rate that way, it\u2019s probably not a bad way to do it either.\nPhil Stefano: Okay. All right. Perfect. That\u2019s all I had.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you, Phil. Well, thank you again, everybody, for being on today this afternoon. We really appreciate it. We delivered an excellent first quarter, and I\u2019d like to thank all of our Gallagher professionals for their hard work, our clients for their trust and our carrier partners for their support. I\u2019m confident that we can deliver another great year of financial performance in 2021 and truly believe we\u2019re just getting started. Thanks for being with us.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your evening.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Doug Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll echo Pat's comments, an excellent quarter and a terrific start to the year. Today, I'll spend most of my time on both our cost savings initiatives and our clean energy cash flows, then highlight a few items in our CFO commentary document, and I'll close with some comments on M&A, cash and liquidity. Before I plunge in on cost, one quick comment on Page 3 in the Brokerage segment organic table. You'll see that we had a great quarter for contingent commissions. There is a little bit of favorable timing in there, call it about 50 basis points on total organic. That will flip the other way next quarter but regardless, a really solid quarter. Okay, let's go to Page 5, the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. You'll see that we grew adjusted EBITDAC by $122 million over last year's first quarter, resulting in about 480 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. That would have been closer to 550 basis points, but as we discussed in our March IR Day, M&A roll-in isn't as seasonally large, and we did strengthen bonus a bit, given our outlook for 2021 as considerably more optimistic today than it was last year at this time standing at the gates of a global pandemic. Within that $122 million of EBITDAC growth is about $60 million that is directly related to our cost savings initiatives, call that about 370 basis points of margin expansion. So when controlling for these three items, we see underlying margin expansion of about 180 basis points on that 6% all-in organic, once again, absolutely terrific execution by the team. Moving on to the Risk Management segment on Page 6. We grew adjusted EBITDAC by $4.3 million, resulting in about 180 basis points of adjusted margin expansion, leading us to post margins nicely over 18%. Most of that was due to our cost savings initiatives. So when I combine our Brokerage and Risk Management segments, savings were around $64 million, pretty similar to the last three quarters and that consists of: reduced travel, entertainment and advertising, about $25 million; reduced consulting and professional fees, about $15 million; reduced outside labor and other workforce costs, about $15 million; and then reduced office supplies, consumables and occupancy costs of about another $9 million. But remember, first quarter 2021 is the last quarter we have a favorable comparison to pre-pandemic spend levels. So now it's all about how much of the cost savings we can hold going forward. As I look at it today, I still believe we will hold a lot of it. As we have said before, we do see certain costs coming back but that won't happen overnight. Our best guess is maybe $15 million coming back in the second quarter 2021, then step that up by about $5 million to $7 million in the third quarter and a similar step-up again in the fourth quarter. Those amounts that I've given are relative to 2020 same quarters adjusted for the roll-in impact of M&A. As for how that translates into margins, that's really dependent on where we land on organic, but say you assume organic is around 5% or above for the remainder of the year, the math would say that would be enough to show some full year margin expansion and regardless of where we land, let's keep this in perspective for the longer term. The pandemic has allowed and perhaps even forced us to accelerate a lot of the improvements we had on the drawing board and also served as an opportunity to design new and better ways to run our business. Both of these make us more productive today than we were 15 months ago and our service quality has even improved. This will provide a lasting benefit for years to come. So let's move now to the CFO commentary document we posted on our investor website. On Page 3, most items are very similar to what we provided at our March IR Day. On Page 4, both clean energy and the corporate line came in better than we had provided in March. The corporate line is just timing between first and third quarters for certain tax items. But the clean energy investments had a much better quarter and we bumped up our full year estimate. It's now looking like $70 million to $80 million of full year after-tax earnings, which is really good news. Next, flip to Page 5 of the CFO commentary. If you missed the clean energy vignette that I gave during our March IR Day, it might be worth to listen to the replay on our website, starts with the hour and 9-minute mark. Here are the punchlines: First, recall, 2021 is the last year of what we call the credit generation era; second, 2022 will be the first meaningful year in the cash harvesting era. This means 2021 is the last year we will report GAAP earnings, and 2022 will be the first year meaningful cash flows show up in our cash flow statement. You'll see here on Page 5 that we think 2022 annual cash flows could increase by around $125 million to $150 million. And finally, this is not a one year benefit to cash flow. We have more than $1 billion of tax credit carryforwards on our balance sheet that should favorably impact cash flows for the next six to seven years. As for M&A capacity, at March 31, available cash on hand was more than $400 million, and we had no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility. So with cash on hand, our untapped borrowing capacity and another year of strong cash flows, it means upwards of $2.5 billion of M&A capacity here in 2021. With a nice M&A pipeline, we are in good shape to continue with our tuck-in strategy. Before I pass it back to Pat, and that was a mouthful, as I sit here today, I see a lot of positives. Organic has nice tailwinds from rate and exposure growth. Add to that a lot of pent-up consumer demand and perhaps a wave of governmental spending. Both could be additional growth catalysts. We have a robust M&A pipeline that should continue to grow, especially if an increase in capital gains tax gets momentum and we've learned a lot from the pandemic on how to operate better, faster and cheaper, all the while improving service quality and our productivity gains we achieved over the last year appear to be sticky. This all bodes well for another year of strong cash flow generation, with a kicker starting in 2022 from our clean energy investment. So, we are very well positioned operationally and financially. I can feel the excitement out in the field about coming out of the pandemic stronger than ever before. It's setting up to be another great year. Back to you, Pat. I think it depends on the recovery pattern. I think there's still a lot of unemployment in there, and we're running somewhere in that 5.5% to 6% range right now. We're going to hold that for the rest of the year. It looks like it could be a pretty good year. So there's nothing inherently different today in that thinking other than it feels kind of like 2019. It was a contingent commission that came in better, primarily fueled that. Right. So there's a lot to unpack in that. I'll hit the capacity. We have up to $2.5 billion worth of M&A capacity this year and we've got a full pipeline of nice tuck-in acquisitions that are out there. In terms of what comes out of the Aon and Willis opportunity, we read the same things that you're reading and we just typically don't comment on acquisitions that we hear about in the papers, but we've got $2.5 billion and we like our tuck-in merger strategy. Yes. I think, Greg, on that one, in particular, too, is that \u2013 and this seems odd for the accountant to say this, but when you \u2013 on that deal, it was owned by an industrial conglomerate that really didn't view brokerage as being its priority, insurance brokerage and I've got to say, for the way our sales leadership and our operational leadership came down to Australia, combined with Steve's relentless focus on sales, we really \u2013 it was really the Australia business that needed a positive shot in the arm when it comes to embracing and supporting a sales culture and we think that what works at Gallagher are people that want to come in and sell insurance and we've worked hard over the number of years to show that we're a broker run by brokers and so we like to sell insurance and that is the culture that we think really, really was the secret sauce to taking \u2013 it was running negative 7% organic in Australia when we bought it and we think we did a terrific job. It's posting nice organic year in and year out since that \u2013 since we did that. There's nothing noteworthy on 606 in the numbers, what could happen in the future. If you had a substantial recovery in covered lives compared to our estimates \u2013 covered lives compared to our estimates today, you could see some upside development in those estimates for the rest of this year. As you know, all that employee benefits business or most of it is a 1/1 renewal. We have to make our estimate of covered lives. And if there was a substantial surge in employment, it would probably pull up those estimates a little bit over the next three quarters as that develops. Yes. So our assumptions in the 606 estimates are not substantial recovery in covered lives, different than where our brokers place the business as they put that to rest here in January. So there isn't a substantial uptick in expectation. Also on that point, remember, that business didn't fall off the cliff last year because the employers that we do are pretty stable employers and so while we didn't have a substantial decrease in covered lives last year, and so I wouldn't expect a substantial recovery of that for the rest of the year. So kind of flat where they renewed is what our expectations were used when we set that reserve \u2013 that estimate. I mean the workforce talent is coming back, so, I think that's \u2013 and that's where we excel and that is helping employers with that. We didn't comment but we're happy to. Not a substantial difference sitting here on April 29, as we saw, let's say, on March 29. But there is \u2013 there are some green shoots. Our consultants are getting some more calls so I think that you'll see a little bit more active summer and fall. Yes. I think there's a little bit of a crossover here, Mark. As COVID claims started to decline, we started to see regular workers' comp claim go up. You'll have a little bit of that in the second quarter but not much. I think the COVID claims are pretty well through our process at this point, and then the regular workers' comp claims will far exceed that going forward. So that might be what you're seeing in that number. Yes. When you look at the dollar \u2013 the year-over-year dollar-over-dollar increases, the dollars are still going up. The rate or the percentage might not be as big because you're on a bigger base, but there's still rate increases happening everywhere. Even workers' comp is getting rate at this point. There's a lot of infrastructure packages out there, and I think that there's opportunity to realize this process does contribute some pretty good value to the environment. So there's always hope. If we get an opportunity to \u2013 in the infrastructure package or in the tax reconciliation process that might come through, there's always hope on that. Sure. What did you assume as the margin on it? Yes, it might be a little thick. I mean a lot of the contingent commissions go to \u2013 when it comes to the leadership variable comp, there's a piece of that that fuels it. So 70% might be a little rich, but some of it, yes, maybe 100 basis points, maybe not 120. Probably almost a point from regular trough then \u2013 and when you take out the contingents and you can't take out the margin from that. No. I think what I was saying is that in the clean energy segment, you're going to start seeing $120 million to \u2013 $125 million to $150 million of additional cash flows that will come through our cash flow statement. We'll obviously make sure that we call that out every quarter on how much is that because it's the rundown of that deferred tax asset that sits on our balance sheet that moves from being a noncash asset into a cash asset. So we'll make sure we highlight it as we go forward. Thanks. Part of that, though too, is remember, our job is to help our client structure programs that actually mitigate some of the rate increase. It's hard to mitigate exposure growth unless you want to take more deductibles or lower limits. Rate increases, there's some \u2013 you can do the same thing, but if somebody adds two or three more trucks, you've got to insure those other two or three more trucks. So if exposure units overtake the recovery from rate on that, the programs that we designed, you'd see more of that hitting the bottom line. But if it's just purely rate, you can mitigate some of that through different program structure. Well, there's two different \u2013 there's different pieces and there's the liability piece and then there's the medical-only piece in traditional workers' comp. I think that the longer-tail liability type workers' comp claim is more profitable to us than just the kind of the recurring medical-only claims, where we're basically paying the bills on it. So you would see that \u2013 you would \u2013 the revenues that come off of a liability-related workers' comp claim would probably exceed the COVID claims. Okay. So you're asking about a year from now in first quarter 2022? I'll help you think that out a second here as I think that, yes, when you look at our 39.2%, the base should probably start from \u2013 you heard the earlier question. We probably got a little lift from contingent commissions in that number, so you want to start off a little bit lower base and let's say by then, we're holding half of our savings, long-term savings compared to where we are today. Maybe there's $30 million worth of costs that are back into the structure by that time and spread that across $1.8 billion or $1.9 billion. That's probably the right way to think about next year. Say that again, I'm sorry. Yes, I think so. Yes. Either way, as long as you understand that last year's second quarter there was a trough and there will be some recovery out of it this year relative to that quarter, but if you're basing it off the last two quarters and want to do a run rate that way, it's probably not a bad way to do it either."

            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you, Laura. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. What a fantastic quarter. We executed against our four long-term operating priorities to drive shareholder value: first, we grew organically; second, we grew through acquisitions; third, we improved our productivity while raising our quality; and fourth, we continue to reap the benefits of our unique Gallagher culture. I'm extremely proud of how our team continues to execute and deliver world-class expertise and service day-in and day-out. We're off to a great start in 2021. So, let me give you some more detail on the quarter, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth of 12.2%, of that, 6% was organic revenue growth, better than our recent IR Day expectations, thanks to an excellent March. Our cost containment efforts saved about $60 million in the quarter, helping drive our net earnings margin higher by 94 basis points and expand our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 480 basis points and net earnings were up 17% and adjusted EBITDAC was up 24%, an excellent quarter from the Brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and give you some soundbites about each of our Brokerage units, starting with our P/C operations. In the U.S., retail organic growth was strong at about 5%. New business was excellent and retention remains strong. In our U.S. wholesale operations, Risk Placement Services organic was about 6%. Open brokerage organic was 15% due to rate increases, higher levels of new business and improved retention. Our MGA program's binding businesses were up about 4%. Retention in new business were similar to the first quarter of 2020. However, we did see a little bit more tailwind from rate and exposure during the quarter. Moving to the UK, over 7% organic for the quarter. In both our retail and specialty operations, new business was up over prior year while retention held pretty steady. Australia and New Zealand combined posted organic of 3%. New business and retention were both similar to prior year. And finally, our Canadian retail operations, excellent organic of 13%, fantastic new business and rate all added to our stellar performance again this quarter. So overall, our global P/C operations posted more than 7% organic, which is better than the 5% to 6% we discussed at our Investor Day, thanks to a really strong March. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. First quarter organic was up slightly, which is better than our March IR Day expectations. Revenue from our traditional health and welfare business held up well, while fees from consulting arrangements, special project work and our life business were up slightly. So when I bring P/C and Benefits together, total Brokerage segment organic was 6%, a really strong start to the year. Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the P/C market, starting with the rate environment. Global P/C rates remain firm overall and the increases we saw during the first quarter of 2021 are consistent with the past couple of quarters. Rates in Canada led the way, up double digits, driven by property and professional liability. In the U.S., rates were up about 7%, including double-digit rate increases within our wholesale open brokerage operations. Our UK retail and London specialty operations combined, rates are up about 5%. And finally, Australia and New Zealand combined, rate increases are in the low single digits. At the same time, capacity is constrained in certain lines and carriers are pushing for tighter terms and conditions. There are also quite a few pockets in the U.S., Canada and London specialty market that I would describe as hard such as cat-exposed properties, cyber, umbrella and public company D&O, just to name a few. So the global P/C environment remains difficult but is giving us some tailwinds. Looking forward, we don't see conditions that would indicate this rate environment will change anytime soon, and we are seeing more and more economic activity across our client base. For example, customers are adding coverages and exposures to their existing policies. And through yesterday, April endorsements, premium audits and other midterm policy adjustments are a net positive overall. That, too, is an encouraging sign. On the benefits side, a recovering labor market in 2021 should favorably impact our core health and welfare business. And we remain optimistic that we will start to see some incremental HR consulting and special project work. This is a terrific time for our team to shine, firm global rates, increasing exposure units and recovering employment. Our clients need our expertise and we are there with the very best insurance, consulting and risk management advice. So while there's a lot of year left, I have greater conviction that our full year 2021 Brokerage segment organic will be equal to or perhaps even better than pre-pandemic 2019 organic. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We finished the first quarter with five completed brokerage mergers, representing about $90 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and I extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in M&A pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing about $250 million of annualized revenues. Our global platform is a great fit for savvy and successful entrepreneurs. We have the tools, data, products, niche expertise and carrier relationships to help these owners support their current clients and take their business to the next level. Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was 0.6%, which is in line with our March IR Day expectations of about flat. It was still a tough compare to pre-pandemic first quarter 2020. However, there is no doubt we are starting to see more and more core workers' comp claim activity when compared to what we were seeing last year at this time. Traditional workers' comp claims are returning and we are seeing fewer and fewer COVID-related claims. Our cost containment efforts paid off again this quarter. We saved around $4 million and expanded our adjusted EBITDAC margin by 180 basis points to 18.4%, another great quarter of execution by the Gallagher Bassett team. Looking forward to the next three quarters, we would expect new claims arising to be higher than what we saw last year, perhaps not back to pre-pandemic levels quite yet but certainly higher than last year. So when I combine that with some really nice new business wins, we should be back to seeing organic in the upper single digits for the next few quarters. That would also bode well for keeping margins above 18% for the remainder of the year. Let me wrap up with some comments regarding our unique Gallagher culture. It's a culture that emphasizes doing things the right way for the right reasons with the right people. It's a culture of service, service to our clients, to one another and to the communities where we work and where we live and our culture continues to be recognized externally. Just last week, Forbes named Gallagher one of the best U.S. employers for diversity and that's on top of Gallagher being recognized by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the world's most ethical companies for the 10th year in a row, 10 straight years, and once again, the sole insurance broker recognized. These recognitions are a direct reflection of our more than 30,000 global colleagues working together as a team guided by the 25 tenets of the Gallagher Way. Culture is a key differentiator for our franchise. Every day, all of our people get up and work diligently to maintain our culture, to promote our culture, to live our culture, and I believe our culture has never been stronger. Doug, over to you. Thanks, Doug. Laura, I think we can go to some questions and answers. Hi, Elyse. Our clients are doing much better, Elyse. I think they are coming back to 2019, not surging beyond it. Hey Greg. Greg, I'll take a shot at that. We did the Arrow deal in London in pretty short order. We're really happy with that acquisition. It turned out to be terrific. We didn't seem to sacrifice anything. Well, I think in that situation, you had very good strong stand-alone businesses that we could, in fact, get to meet the leadership of. I think you remember the story. We did fly to Australia, met leadership and gave them the choice. They were planning on going public in their own right. We met two leaders with \u2013 the entire top leadership. And basically, that evening said, \"You've got a choice to make. You want to go public on your own or do you want to join us?\" Steve Lockwood, who's still with us, had that decision to make. I think he made a pretty good decision. Things are going great. Canada, our Canadian operation was running negative organic as well. Remember, he's been around 20 years, Greg. Thanks Greg. Hi David. Where we see some opportunity to grow back is the fee business. That business was just \u2013 it was slammed shut at the end of the first quarter last year and those are projects that need to be done. They need professionals to do them, and I think that there will be some more demand there. Let's hope. Yes. Let me be real clear, David. I think these players in the market, they want to ignore contracts, lift teams, litigate and call that a cheaper way to get talent. Let me see if I can clean up my comments. I don't like that. We like to see people that have built companies, entrepreneurial in nature, have a culture, respect their clients, respect their people and sell ongoing enterprises to us. Do we recruit individual people? Absolutely. And do we bring teams across? Yes, we do. But the other method isn't for us. Thanks David Hi Mark. Hi Mark. No, we're not. I think we're seeing consistent demand for proper pricing. We've been a couple of years now into some hardening numbers. So I do think that over time, that will moderate but we're not seeing any lack of discipline in the market at this point and underwriters are continuing to ask for increases. Thanks Mark. Thanks. Hope so. Thanks Meyer. Thank you, Phil. Well, thank you again, everybody, for being on today this afternoon. We really appreciate it. We delivered an excellent first quarter, and I'd like to thank all of our Gallagher professionals for their hard work, our clients for their trust and our carrier partners for their support. I'm confident that we can deliver another great year of financial performance in 2021 and truly believe we're just getting started. Thanks for being with us."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO, Arthur J. Gallagher & Company.  Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nPatrick Gallagher: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter '22 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had a terrific finish to cap off an excellent year. During the quarter, for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 16% growth in revenue, 11.7% organic growth. GAAP earnings per share of $0.83, adjusted earnings per share of $1.86, up 24% year-over-year, reported net earnings margin of 9%, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 29.6%, up 120 basis points. We also completed 17 mergers totaling more than $140 million of estimated annualized revenues in addition to announcing our agreement to acquire Buck, another fantastic quarter by the team and our best fourth quarter in decades. Let me give you some more detail on our fourth quarter performance, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 16%. Organic was 11%. Doug will explain it does include a point from our Annual 606 review, Brokerage organic and double digits is outstanding. Acquisition rollover revenues were $107 million, and our adjusted EBITDAC margin was 31.3%, up 120 basis points and in line with our December IR Day expectations, another excellent quarter for the brokerage team. Focusing on the Brokerage segment organic, let me walk you around the world and provide some more detailed commentary starting with our P/C operations. Our U.S. retail business posted 8% organic, our new business was a bit better than last year offset somewhat by less nonrecurring business, client retention and the combined impact of rate and exposure were both similar to last year's fourth quarter. Risk Placement Services, our U.S. wholesale operations, posted organic above 9%. This includes more than 12% organic and open brokerage and about 7% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business was strong and retention was consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Shifting to outside the U.S. Our U.K. businesses, both retail and specialty combined posted organic of 17% benefiting from excellent new business production, strong retention and the continued impact of renewal premium increases. Australia and New Zealand combined, organic was 12%. Net new versus loss business was consistent with last year and renewal premium increases were above fourth quarter '21 levels. Canada was up nearly 9% organically, reflecting solid new business and retention. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Organic was 3%, consistent with our December IR Day expectations. New business was similar to last year's fourth quarter and retention remained excellent. And finally, to reinsurance. Our legacy reinsurance operations crushed it with some hard earned new business wins and quarterly organic well into double digits. And recall that December was the first month our newly acquired reinsurance operations were included in organic. And while off a very small revenue base, they too had a spectacular organic growth for the month. So combined, Gallagher Re team continues to deliver outstanding results. So again, Brokerage segment, all in organic double digits. And with our outstanding fourth quarter finish, full year organic came in at 9.7%. That's our best full year Brokerage segment organic performance in decades and even more impressive when you consider we grew on top of the 8% organic we posted in '21. Next, let me give you some thoughts on the current P/C market environment starting in the primary insurance market. Overall, global fourth quarter renewal premiums, that's both rate and exposure combined, were up more than 9% that's consistent with the 8% to 10% renewal premium change we have been reporting throughout '22. Fourth quarter renewal premium changes by line of business were broadly consistent with the first 3 quarters of '22 with 1 exception, which is D&O. D&O continues to be the one area where rates are flat to down slightly, but in some cases, our customers are using the weaker pricing to purchase more limit. Exposures also continue to be consistent with the first 3 quarters of '22, indicating continued strength in our customers' business activity. In fact, fourth quarter midterm policy endorsements, audits and cancellations were better than fourth quarter '21 levels. Looking ahead, these trends appear to be holding. Thus far in January, midterm policy endorsements and audit adjustments are trending higher than last year's level and global renewal premium increases are consistent with the fourth quarter. But remember, our job is to help clients mitigate premium increases and provide an appropriate level of risk transfer that fits their budgets. Shifting to reinsurance and the important January 1 renewals. As we discussed in our 1st View Market report published earlier this month, it was a very late and complex reinsurance renewal season. Not surprising, U.S. peak zone property cat reinsurance saw some of the largest price increases. But it's worth noting 4 additional trends within property cat: First, attachment points were raised broadly; second, reinsurers pushed to remove prepaid reinstatements from some contracts; third, reinsurers, in some cases, were able to reduce coverage to named perils only; and fourth, top layers of many programs saw the largest percentage increases as reinsurers sought to push up minimum premium rates. On the casualty side, prices were up in the single to low double-digit range for most programs, while terms and conditions were more stable. Despite the tough market backdrop of higher prices, lower capacity and tightening terms, the reinsurance team was able to deliver favorable outcomes for our clients. Looking forward, the challenging reinsurance market conditions will, no doubt, put pricing pressure on the primary market during '23, and that's on top of our primary carrier partners dealing with catastrophe losses in secondary perils, including convective storms, floods and wildfires, high replacement cost inflation from raw materials to shortages in labor, social inflation, combined with the easing of the judicial system law , escalating medical cost trends and ongoing geopolitical tensions. So there's good reason to expect continued price increases and cautious underwriting for the foreseeable future. And as I mentioned before, we are not seeing any signs of exposure contraction. Rather, it seems our clients' business activity remains unchanged from the past few quarters. Within our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business, the backdrop for '23 is also broadly favorable. Employers continue to add jobs and wages are growing. So demand for our services and offerings should remain robust. So as I sit here today, '23 could be another fantastic year with brokerage organic growth nicely in the 7% to 9% range. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We had a really active fourth quarter completing 17 new tuck-in brokerage mergers representing more than $140 million of estimated annual revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.  For the year, we completed 36 mergers, representing annualized revenue of about $250 million. Additionally, we announced an agreement to acquire Buck, a very complementary business providing retirement, HR and employee benefits consulting and administrative services with estimated annualized revenues of $280 million. We expect the transaction to close during the second quarter and look forward to welcoming our new colleagues. Moving to our merger and acquisition pipeline. We have nearly 45 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing more than $300 million of annualized revenue. We know not all of these will close. However, we believe we will get our fair share. And before I conclude my M&A comments, let me give you a quick recap on our reinsurance acquisition now that we have a full year in our books. We had a fantastic '22, thanks to strong client retention, the expansion of existing client relationships, some great new business wins and excellent growth in our pro rata business. The team is fully assimilated, is delivering for clients and there's a lot of momentum. I believe we're on track for an even better '23. Needless to say, reinsurance continues to be an exciting story. Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was 15.6% as a strong finish to the quarter pushed organic above our mid-December expectation. Core new arising claims increased during the quarter, driven by recent new business wins and continued growth from existing clients. And fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was great at 19.3%. So putting it all together, Gallagher Bassett finished the year with an adjusted EBITDAC margin of 18.5% and 13.3% organic benefiting from increased claim activity coming out of the pandemic and some really nice new business wins. Looking forward, full year '23 organic should be pushing 10% and adjusted EBITDAC margins should be around 19%. That would be another fantastic year. And I'd like to conclude with some comments regarding our bedrock culture. It's a culture of teamwork, client service and excellence, captured and celebrated in the Gallagher way. It is the culture that drove full year '22 results for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments of 24% growth in adjusted revenues, 10% all-in organic, 25% growth in adjusted EBITDAC, adjusted EBITDAC margin in excess of 32% and 20% growth in adjusted EPS. We have a culture that our people believe in, embrace and live every day. It's a culture that will continue to drive us forward. That is the Gallagher way. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. A fantastic fourth quarter to close out another outstanding year. Today, I'll start with our earnings release, touching on organic margins and the Corporate segment shortcut table. Next, I'll walk you through our CFO commentary document, point out a few items for the next quarter and also provide a first look at our typical modeling helpers for '23 then I'll finish up with some comments on cash, M&A capacity and capital management. Okay. Let's flip to Page 3 of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment organic table. All in brokerage organic of 11%, above the 9% to 9.5% that we foreshadowed in December. Two drivers of the upside. First, as Pat just discussed, we had a really strong finish within our P&C and reinsurance brokerage operations. Second, our annual update of 606 assumptions added about 1 point to our headline organic. Recall under ASC 606, we must routinely update our assumptions related to the amount of services provided before and after the placement of an insurance policy. Based on our most recent operational analysis, metrics and time studies, more of our services being provided at the time of placement and more of the post placement service is being handled faster in our lower-cost centers of excellence. This causes less of our revenue to be deferred and thus, we recognized an additional $15 million of revenue in the quarter. That is a small amount relative to our total deferred revenue balance nearly $435 million, but it does cause an additional point of organic. So we're the call out today.  From an expense perspective, our updated 606 assumptions also caused some additional compensation expense to be recognized during the quarter. The punchline of all this, our fourth quarter organic revenues, EBITDAC and net earnings got a small boost and adjusted EBITDAC margin was not significantly impacted. So 11% headline organic, 10% controlling for 606 and 120 basis points of margin expansion, that's a terrific quarter. Looking forward to '23, we're currently not seeing a slowdown in our clients' business activity. We're not seeing signs of price moderation from the carriers, and we still have loss cost inflation and labor market imbalances. Add that to our client for sales and service culture, we are still seeing '23 organic in that 7% to 9% range, as we stated during our December IR Day. Same with our margin outlook for '23. We are still comfortable with our December commentary. We think we can deliver about 50 basis margin expansion at 6% organic and fiduciary investment income could be a nice margin sweetener provided there isn't a surge in wage and cost inflation. One other [indiscernible] heads up for '23. On December 20, we announced our acquisition of Buck. The business operations operates at an adjusted EBITDAC margin around 20%, so please make sure a portion of your pick for future M&A revenues reflects that versus what you might pick for our other mergers. Moving on to the Risk Management segment and the organic table at the bottom of Page 6. You'll see 15.6% organic in the fourth quarter and full year organic in excess of 13%. Some of that growth this year comes from our clients' business activity still rebounding out of the pandemic and getting back to levels they saw before the pandemic. Accordingly, for '23, we're seeing organic revenue approaching 10%. Flipping to Page 7. The Risk Management adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.3% in the quarter and 18.5% for the full year. We see a nice step-up in '23 with margins around 19% even as we continue to make investments to enhance the client experience and in analytics and tools to drive better claim outcomes. Another year of double-digit growth and margin expansion would be another terrific year. Turning to Page 8 to the Corporate segment shortcut table. In total, adjusted results were at the favorable end of our December IR day forecast. You also see 2 non-GAAP adjustments this quarter. First, our M&A transaction costs of $5 million after tax, mostly related to Buck and a little relates to Willis treaty. And second, as we discussed previously, you'll see a $31 million after-tax gain related to legal and tax matters. Now shifting to our CFO commentary document we posted on our IR website, starting on Page 3. As for fourth quarter, you'll see most of the brokerage and risk management items are close to our December IR day estimates. On the right-hand side of the page, we're providing our first look at '23. A couple of things worth highlighting: First, FX. With last year's midyear strengthening in the U.S. dollar, you'll see some volatility in how FX will impact our brokerage and risk management results in first half versus second half of '23. Please make sure to consider these impacts as you're planning your models. Second, our adjusted tax rate. With the U.K. corporate tax rate increasing to 25% effective April 1, we're providing our current estimate for full year '23 tax rate. More of an impact to our Brokerage segment than it is to our Risk Management segment, given the size of our U.K. retail London specialty and reinsurance brokerage operation. And one other thing. The left side of this page might be a nice reference when making your picks for quarterly margins given our quarterly seasonality. And finally, when you do make your margin picks, recall we were still in the Omicron portion of the pandemic during the first quarter of '22. So we're not expecting as much margin expansion in first quarter as we are in the second, third and fourth quarter of '23. Okay. Moving to Page 5. This page is here to highlight the incremental cash flows from our clean energy investments over the coming years. And remember, those come through the cash flow statement, not the P&L. You'll also see that we have $773 million of available tax credits as of December 31, '22. And that we forecast using about $180 million to $200 million in '23 and that should step up a bit in '24 and each later year. That's a really nice cash flow boost to help fund our M&A.  The way I look at the math, it might say that an additional $773 million of free cash, combined maybe another $70 million of recurring EBITDAC at that 10 to 11x multiple, which would then have a nice arbitrage for our current trading multiple. Moving to Page 6 on the rollover revenue table. For the fourth quarter, rollover revenues came in higher than our December IR day guidance. Most of all of that came from reinsurance. Over the last 3 weeks, cedents have been closing their books for '22, and we're getting updated ceded premium figures. That translated into additional commission revenue for '22. For the sake of clarity, nearly all of that upside is excluded from our organic results because it likely relates to pre-December 1, '22, which marked the first year anniversary of the acquisition. And no -- also, please note that not all of that hits the bottom line because of production and incentive comp expense on that additional revenue. That said, it's terrific to get the bump-up.  Staying on Page 6, but moving down to the bottom table. That table shows our actual reinsurance acquisition results. In a transition year, the team overperformed our pro forma expectation. That's impressive and terrific work by the team. So now let me move to some final comments on cash, capital management and future M&A. At December 31, available cash on hand was about $325 million. Our current cash position, combined with strong expected cash flows and incremental borrowing positions us well for our pipeline of M&A opportunities. In total, we estimate towards $3 billion to fund potential M&A opportunities during '23, which would include paying for Buck. And also yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend by $0.04 per share. That would imply an annual payout of $2.20 per share. That's a 7.8% increase over '22. So with a strong organic outlook, margin expansion opportunities and an ever-growing M&A pipeline, from my vantage point as CFO, we are extremely well positioned for another fantastic year in '23. I'd like to thank the entire Gallagher team for another great quarter and outstanding year. Back to you, Pat.\nPatrick Gallagher: Thank you, Doug. Operator, I think we're ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS.\nWeston Bloomer: So my first question is on the reinsurance market and the growth you saw there. It's obviously really strong end of the quarter. And I think you've talked about high single-digit growth there for 2023. So did the end of the year kind of change how you think about that level of growth? Or how should we be thinking that going into next year?\nPatrick Gallagher: I think we are definitely going with some nice momentum. I wouldn't bank on some incremental big jump. But what I like about the momentum is when you come through a time like we did in this fourth quarter, it's interesting because you actually become much more valuable to your clients. And it's not an easy time when you're tussling back and forth with the cedents and the reinsurers trying to get these things done, terms are changing. Attachment levels are changing. But in the end, as I said in my prepared remarks, we got the placements made, and I think we are in a very strong position going forward, number one, with those clients, but also with the opportunity to pick up some new business.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. And then my second question within brokerage as well. I noticed the compensation ratio as a percentage of revenue dropped pretty materially. And I think you'd called out some back-office saves, lower benefit costs, offset by some hiring. Is there a way you can call out how much each of those had an impact? Or where I'm trying to go with the question is how much additional leverage do you have to kind of bring that lower in 2023?\nDouglas Howell: All right. Let me see if I can break that out from memory here. I don't have it in front of me exactly, but when you're talking about being down was at 180 basis points, something like that. Yes. Is that right? I'm just going from memory, Sorry, I'll look it up here. Probably 1/3 of that is due to the continued efficiency that we bring by being able to push work into our lower-cost centers of excellence. I think that we've had some technology wins in that area, too, to help us make our workforce more effective on that and didn't have to put on additional heads as a result of that -- those technology investments. And then I think that when it came to -- the other 1/3 is kind of escaping you right here.\nWeston Bloomer: Got it. Is there any change to the compensation structure that you make in this market, too? I know there's some changes just, I guess, higher organic accounts, things like that.\nPatrick Gallagher: No. We're pleased to pay our people for what they do. And we haven't messed with that compensation arrangement with our production force, in particular, in well over a decade.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of with Autonomous Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: I want to follow up on the almost 10% 2022 brokerage organic results. Would you mind giving us some more color as to how pricing and exposure and net new business drove that year-over-year acceleration in organic. And then from where you sit today, how do you see those drivers changing in 2023?\nDouglas Howell: So are you asking for the quarter? Are you asking for the full year? Sorry, just so I've got the baseline.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, yes, for the full year.\nDouglas Howell: For the full year, right? So when I look at rate and exposure, as I did, our new business, we had a terrific new business here. So I'll say that our net new business spread was about 4 points and the rest of that is probably rate and exposure, remember between that. So maybe, again, you think about it, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 net new business over loss business is 1/3, rate was 1/3 and exposure unit growth was 1/3.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, do you have any comments on the degree to which fiduciary investment income will impact margins next year, kind of thinking about that 50 bps of expansion on 6% organic, how much that move from fiduciary investment income?\nDouglas Howell: I think the -- when we give the guidance of 6 points, if we grow organically, 6%, we think we can show about 50 basis points of margin expansion on that. Investment income would be a sweetener to that. to a certain extent. But I don't have a clear line of sight yet on the size of our raise pool and our hiring needs going into next year. We understand our budget. So I can't give you a specific number on it, but you give me a pick on what you think wage inflation is going to be next year to take care of our folks, and I can probably give you that number, but I don't think we're ready yet. I might be able to give you some more of that in March.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: I'm going to stick on the margin commentary. In your press releases on Page 4, you talked about the operating expense ratio and some of the pressures on that. So when you -- in your guide the 50 basis points or so of margin expansion provided 6% organic, how do we think about those factors affecting your ability to expand margins? And then just on the margin expansion, can you break it out based on business unit like is it going to come in international that you're going to get margin expansion or is it going to come into the employee benefits business, you get margin expansion? Or can you source where you think that's going to -- where that -- where the improvement is going to come from?\nDouglas Howell: Right. A couple of things. On the operating expense ratio, it was up in fourth quarter versus '21 fourth quarter, was up about 30 to 40 basis points, let's call it, 40 basis points on that. I think the footnote on that is explaining where it's coming from, mostly travel and entertainment, some consulting use and investments in technology. So I'd say it's probably half of that increase is investments and half of it is just the inflation that we're seeing in travel and consulting costs on that. When you're -- I think the next question was how am I seeing that vis-a-vis next year.  Remember, we were still in the omicron portion of the pandemic in the first quarter. So we are going to see a little more travel and entertainment expense return in our first quarter, but we don't see it being up significantly in the second, third and fourth quarters. So we're looking at 50 basis points of expansion next year. Most of that will come in the later 3 quarters than the first quarter. And what was there was another piece of your question, Greg?\nCharles Peters: It was just when I think about within the Brokerage business, the different business units, the employee benefits, the international the retail RPS, when you look at it that way, where do you think the opportunity is for margin expansion in the context of that 50 basis points or so guidance?\nDouglas Howell: Yes, it's pretty much so across all of them, Greg -- there is no standout in there anywhere that's a laggard in there.\nCharles Peters: Makes sense. Okay. And the other -- just the other sort of cleanup question on Buck consulting. Can you give us -- is there any sort of cadence in terms of how the revenue flows and how the margins are. I mean is it heavier in the first quarter, either revenue or margins? Or any sort of color you can add as we -- and just as a follow-up, I assume that's also going to get folded into the Brokerage segment, correct?\nDouglas Howell: Yes. So it will be part of our Brokerage segment and our Employee Benefit operation. Greg, we don't think we're going to close that in the first quarter. We think it's more of a second quarter close at this point. I don't really have a good quarterly spread that I would feel comfortable giving on the call today for that because we have to apply our study on conforming the accounting principles to theirs, apply our 606 assumptions to it. So I need a little more time to work through that. And we just signed the deal 30 days ago, and I just need to until March to give you that quarterly spread.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Michael Ward with Citi.\nMichael Ward: We heard, I guess, one of your peers about -- talk about programs participants pushing back on capacity or trying to restructure commissions. I was wondering if you're seeing something similar.\nPatrick Gallagher: No.\nDouglas Howell: Not really.\nPatrick Gallagher: Not really.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Second one, I guess I was wondering, your deal spend has kind of accelerated over the last few months. It seems hoping you could maybe discuss the drivers behind that. And maybe talk about how you see 2023 playing out in this regard?\nPatrick Gallagher: We have definitely seen a change in the competitive environment vis-a-vis mergers and acquisitions in the last 60 days. I'm not going to sit here and say it's not still competitive, it is. But I would say that the number of bidders is reduced, and we are seeing maybe, what I would call, a more attentive seller to exactly who the buyer is, what the culture is, the strategic value of that buyer that maybe existed 12 months ago.\nDouglas Howell: Yes, we usually see a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter as people push to get things done by the end of the year, sometimes that's driven by tax or other financial planning that the sellers want to get done. But if there is a noticeable change in the market. I would say that we feel very good about our pipeline right now. There are some names on there that are really nice to have looking at us. So a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter, naturally, change in market competitiveness a little bit. But I also think it's going to be pretty strong in the first couple of quarters of the year relative to what we saw this year, in particular.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: Maybe sticking on the M&A point. You guys seem pretty optimistic with the pipeline, and you have announced a good number of deals of late. But if I look on the CFO commentary sheet, you also write the multiples you're seeing on deals went up 1x, right, 10 to 11x from 9 to 10, what are you seeing, I guess, in the market that's driving up multiples a little bit?\nDouglas Howell: I think it's mix right now is what we're seeing is -- I think that you're seeing some pretty high performing names on the list where the growth factors are a little bit bigger than maybe they were in the past. But one turn on that, it wouldn't overly react to it one way or another.\nElyse Greenspan: And then with your margin guide for kind of the 50 to 60 basis points of expansion, are you assuming any wage inflation embedded within that guide?\nDouglas Howell: Yes. We're assuming that we're paying raises this year about similar to what we have for the last 2 years. So that's in the numbers. Also in that, I did a little -- I did a small vignette during the December IR Day. If you really look underneath that, there's probably 10 or 15 basis points as we toggle to Software as a Service that might be against that 50 basis points, too. So maybe it's more like 60 basis points, but in the accounting of where that expense gets charged does influence that a little bit. You and I talked about that in December, I think, too.\nElyse Greenspan: And then on the reinsurance side, strong into the year, great rate increases we saw at January 1, but also we've seen higher retentions by primary companies. And I don't think we've really been in a similar environment, right, where you have 40% price increases with perhaps less premium to the market. So when you put that all together, does '23 feel like an environment where you could show double-digit organic growth within your reinsurance business?\nPatrick Gallagher: Yes, I think we could.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: My first question is on the U.K. retail and specialty organic of 17%. Obviously, very strong. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what's driving that growth.\nPatrick Gallagher: Yes. As we said, a very, very strong new business in specialty with tenant rate increases. And as we've talked earlier, there were some term changes and the like. But also our aviation specialty team just crushed it this quarter in the U.K. And our retail operation across the United Kingdom did extremely well also. But I just think the whole London-based specialty team, reinsurance aviation just is set phenomenal close to the year.\nRobert Cox: That's great. And just a question on the labor market. A number of companies are instituting layoffs. I'm just curious what type of unemployment rate is embedded in your organic guide of 7% to 9%. And if we did start to see some erosion there, at what point in the year do you think we would start to see that impact potentially in your organic growth?\nPatrick Gallagher: Well, let me just back up to our prepared comments again. It's very, very interesting. First of all, we don't play that much in the high-tech Employee Benefit business, and it's not that big a segment for us in terms of the layoffs you're seeing that are making the newspaper. And as I've said in previous quarters, we're already in the same papers, right? And we all see the same news reports. However, our middle market, core business is doing -- our clients are doing extremely well, and we keep reporting our -- what we're seeing in our midterm endorsements and changes to policies and as we see both our renewals and the audits going forward, our middle market, retail, property casualty benefits business, these people are doing very, very well.  Truck counts are up. Our trucking business is very strong. Our work comp renewals in terms of payrolls are not being diminished. Now that doesn't mean that if there is, in fact, a global recession that it won't impact us, of course, it will. But at this point in time, we're not seeing that. So if you ask me where do we see an impact on that type of growth as we go forward this year. I'll tell you, our plans at present don't count on any recessionary pressure. And that could be wrong.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Andrew on for Yaron. Just looking at head count in Brokerage, it looks like there's been a pretty good pickup year-to-date and in the quarter specifically. Can we kind of talk about what's going on there? And roles you're hiring and the degree to which those hires have been reflected in organic yet?\nDouglas Howell: Yes. Well, a lot of that -- remember those numbers are impacted considerably by our M&A program. So as we close the year out strong on M&A, those numbers would be in the December numbers and not in last year's December numbers, and that would impact the quarter 2.\nPatrick Gallagher: And I would want to comment on that as well. We are not undergoing an organic surge in new hiring. We have a very strong internship. We bring on a very strong number of young people every year. Of course, we're always looking for good solid production hires, but you are not seeing our organic head count surge beyond the M&A activity that Doug just mentioned.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. And as we think about supplemental and contingent commissions, I suppose a part of that is based on underwriting profitability of those programs. So when you think about '23, is there kind of a loss trend that you bake into forward guidance there? Or maybe more broadly, what is your view on loss trends over the course of the next year?\nDouglas Howell: Are you're talking about the carriers loss trends?\nPatrick Gallagher: Yes, our contingents.\nDouglas Howell: Right, that relates to the contingents.\nPatrick Gallagher: Supplementals are not subject typically to profit-sharing arrangements, our contingents are. And to date, I'd say we probably factored nothing in, in terms of having significant increases in our operating loss ratios.\nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist.\nMark Hughes: Another P&C CEO suggested he didn't see as much increase in property rates in the fourth quarter as you might have expected in light of the reinsurance market dynamics, but maybe that's something that builds up as the time goes by is the higher reinsurance rates do directly impact the carriers. Would you share that observation? Do you think property could get firmer on the primary level?\nPatrick Gallagher: I think property could get a lot firmer. I would say in the fourth quarter, it was very firm, in particular, in anything that had to do with Coastal, any area that was exposed to wind and fire. This market in terms of property is very difficult as it exists. And, yes, the changes to reinsurance at 1/1 will filter additional pressure onto the retail buyer. And we are out early telling our retail buyers about this. And it is going to get more difficult in what is already a very extremely difficult situation.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. If you think about -- remember, our fourth quarter, Ian hit right at the beginning of the fourth quarter, there were replacements that were done in October and November that hadn't had the full impact of the $70 billion loss.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Yes. And then, Pat, last quarter, you mentioned a potential spillover effect on casualty. I don't know whether you updated your commentary on that this quarter, but do you think the reinsurance market, how much of an impact, I think, it's having on casualty, ?\nPatrick Gallagher: Mark, I don't have a number on that yet. I just think that it's possible that in order to pay for some of these property increases, other lines are going to have to be tagged. And I think I'll be able to feel that since it maybe have a better number around that at the end of the first quarter. And I may be wrong on that. At this point, I'm not being told by our carriers that that's happening.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Michael Ward with Citi.\nMichael Ward: I just had a quick follow-up maybe on Elyse's question and the potential for double-digit growth in reinsurance. Just wondering if that's kind of -- if we should think about that as being achievable with current capacity or if incremental capacity might need to come to the market in order to get there?\nPatrick Gallagher: I think that it will be achievable with existing capacity. I was very pleased -- our reinsurance people were telling us in late November and December, early December that they were very fearful some of these placements just weren't going to get done. And that is a nightmare on all sides of the equation. And in fact, really, really pleased and proud of the team that did the work to bring the programs together for our clients as January got going here. So I think on existing capacity, of course, the largest renewal season is now winding down. It's not over, but it's winding down. And so I do think the increases going forward could come off existing capacity. However, having said that, any additional capacity would be very welcome and will be utilized quickly and would add to that. All right. Then let me just add a few comments as I wrap up. I want to thank you again for joining us this evening. Obviously, I'm very pleased with our '22 financial performance. I am still very excited about our future. I want to thank our clients for their continued trust, our 43,000-plus colleagues for their passion, hard work and dedication. And finally, I need to mention our carrier partners. They do play an integral role in meeting our clients' insurance and risk management needs. And we look forward to speaking with you all again at our March IR Day. So thank you for being with us, and we'll talk to you then.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter '22 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had a terrific finish to cap off an excellent year. During the quarter, for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 16% growth in revenue, 11.7% organic growth. GAAP earnings per share of $0.83, adjusted earnings per share of $1.86, up 24% year-over-year, reported net earnings margin of 9%, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 29.6%, up 120 basis points. We also completed 17 mergers totaling more than $140 million of estimated annualized revenues in addition to announcing our agreement to acquire Buck, another fantastic quarter by the team and our best fourth quarter in decades. Let me give you some more detail on our fourth quarter performance, starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 16%. Organic was 11%. Doug will explain it does include a point from our Annual 606 review, Brokerage organic and double digits is outstanding. Acquisition rollover revenues were $107 million, and our adjusted EBITDAC margin was 31.3%, up 120 basis points and in line with our December IR Day expectations, another excellent quarter for the brokerage team. Focusing on the Brokerage segment organic, let me walk you around the world and provide some more detailed commentary starting with our P/C operations. Our U.S. retail business posted 8% organic, our new business was a bit better than last year offset somewhat by less nonrecurring business, client retention and the combined impact of rate and exposure were both similar to last year's fourth quarter. Risk Placement Services, our U.S. wholesale operations, posted organic above 9%. This includes more than 12% organic and open brokerage and about 7% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business was strong and retention was consistent with last year's fourth quarter. Shifting to outside the U.S. Our U.K. businesses, both retail and specialty combined posted organic of 17% benefiting from excellent new business production, strong retention and the continued impact of renewal premium increases. Australia and New Zealand combined, organic was 12%. Net new versus loss business was consistent with last year and renewal premium increases were above fourth quarter '21 levels. Canada was up nearly 9% organically, reflecting solid new business and retention. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business. Organic was 3%, consistent with our December IR Day expectations. New business was similar to last year's fourth quarter and retention remained excellent. And finally, to reinsurance. Our legacy reinsurance operations crushed it with some hard earned new business wins and quarterly organic well into double digits. And recall that December was the first month our newly acquired reinsurance operations were included in organic. And while off a very small revenue base, they too had a spectacular organic growth for the month. So combined, Gallagher Re team continues to deliver outstanding results. So again, Brokerage segment, all in organic double digits. And with our outstanding fourth quarter finish, full year organic came in at 9.7%. That's our best full year Brokerage segment organic performance in decades and even more impressive when you consider we grew on top of the 8% organic we posted in '21. Next, let me give you some thoughts on the current P/C market environment starting in the primary insurance market. Overall, global fourth quarter renewal premiums, that's both rate and exposure combined, were up more than 9% that's consistent with the 8% to 10% renewal premium change we have been reporting throughout '22. Fourth quarter renewal premium changes by line of business were broadly consistent with the first 3 quarters of '22 with 1 exception, which is D&O. D&O continues to be the one area where rates are flat to down slightly, but in some cases, our customers are using the weaker pricing to purchase more limit. Exposures also continue to be consistent with the first 3 quarters of '22, indicating continued strength in our customers' business activity. In fact, fourth quarter midterm policy endorsements, audits and cancellations were better than fourth quarter '21 levels. Looking ahead, these trends appear to be holding. Thus far in January, midterm policy endorsements and audit adjustments are trending higher than last year's level and global renewal premium increases are consistent with the fourth quarter. But remember, our job is to help clients mitigate premium increases and provide an appropriate level of risk transfer that fits their budgets. Shifting to reinsurance and the important January 1 renewals. As we discussed in our 1st View Market report published earlier this month, it was a very late and complex reinsurance renewal season. Not surprising, U.S. peak zone property cat reinsurance saw some of the largest price increases. But it's worth noting 4 additional trends within property cat: First, attachment points were raised broadly; second, reinsurers pushed to remove prepaid reinstatements from some contracts; third, reinsurers, in some cases, were able to reduce coverage to named perils only; and fourth, top layers of many programs saw the largest percentage increases as reinsurers sought to push up minimum premium rates. On the casualty side, prices were up in the single to low double-digit range for most programs, while terms and conditions were more stable. Despite the tough market backdrop of higher prices, lower capacity and tightening terms, the reinsurance team was able to deliver favorable outcomes for our clients. Looking forward, the challenging reinsurance market conditions will, no doubt, put pricing pressure on the primary market during '23, and that's on top of our primary carrier partners dealing with catastrophe losses in secondary perils, including convective storms, floods and wildfires, high replacement cost inflation from raw materials to shortages in labor, social inflation, combined with the easing of the judicial system law , escalating medical cost trends and ongoing geopolitical tensions. So there's good reason to expect continued price increases and cautious underwriting for the foreseeable future. And as I mentioned before, we are not seeing any signs of exposure contraction. Rather, it seems our clients' business activity remains unchanged from the past few quarters. Within our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business, the backdrop for '23 is also broadly favorable. Employers continue to add jobs and wages are growing. So demand for our services and offerings should remain robust. So as I sit here today, '23 could be another fantastic year with brokerage organic growth nicely in the 7% to 9% range. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We had a really active fourth quarter completing 17 new tuck-in brokerage mergers representing more than $140 million of estimated annual revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals.  For the year, we completed 36 mergers, representing annualized revenue of about $250 million. Additionally, we announced an agreement to acquire Buck, a very complementary business providing retirement, HR and employee benefits consulting and administrative services with estimated annualized revenues of $280 million. We expect the transaction to close during the second quarter and look forward to welcoming our new colleagues. Moving to our merger and acquisition pipeline. We have nearly 45 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing more than $300 million of annualized revenue. We know not all of these will close. However, we believe we will get our fair share. And before I conclude my M&A comments, let me give you a quick recap on our reinsurance acquisition now that we have a full year in our books. We had a fantastic '22, thanks to strong client retention, the expansion of existing client relationships, some great new business wins and excellent growth in our pro rata business. The team is fully assimilated, is delivering for clients and there's a lot of momentum. I believe we're on track for an even better '23. Needless to say, reinsurance continues to be an exciting story. Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was 15.6% as a strong finish to the quarter pushed organic above our mid-December expectation. Core new arising claims increased during the quarter, driven by recent new business wins and continued growth from existing clients. And fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was great at 19.3%. So putting it all together, Gallagher Bassett finished the year with an adjusted EBITDAC margin of 18.5% and 13.3% organic benefiting from increased claim activity coming out of the pandemic and some really nice new business wins. Looking forward, full year '23 organic should be pushing 10% and adjusted EBITDAC margins should be around 19%. That would be another fantastic year. And I'd like to conclude with some comments regarding our bedrock culture. It's a culture of teamwork, client service and excellence, captured and celebrated in the Gallagher way. It is the culture that drove full year '22 results for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments of 24% growth in adjusted revenues, 10% all-in organic, 25% growth in adjusted EBITDAC, adjusted EBITDAC margin in excess of 32% and 20% growth in adjusted EPS. We have a culture that our people believe in, embrace and live every day. It's a culture that will continue to drive us forward. That is the Gallagher way. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thank you, Doug. Operator, I think we're ready for questions. I think we are definitely going with some nice momentum. I wouldn't bank on some incremental big jump. But what I like about the momentum is when you come through a time like we did in this fourth quarter, it's interesting because you actually become much more valuable to your clients. And it's not an easy time when you're tussling back and forth with the cedents and the reinsurers trying to get these things done, terms are changing. Attachment levels are changing. But in the end, as I said in my prepared remarks, we got the placements made, and I think we are in a very strong position going forward, number one, with those clients, but also with the opportunity to pick up some new business. No. We're pleased to pay our people for what they do. And we haven't messed with that compensation arrangement with our production force, in particular, in well over a decade. No. Not really. We have definitely seen a change in the competitive environment vis-a-vis mergers and acquisitions in the last 60 days. I'm not going to sit here and say it's not still competitive, it is. But I would say that the number of bidders is reduced, and we are seeing maybe, what I would call, a more attentive seller to exactly who the buyer is, what the culture is, the strategic value of that buyer that maybe existed 12 months ago. Yes, I think we could. Yes. As we said, a very, very strong new business in specialty with tenant rate increases. And as we've talked earlier, there were some term changes and the like. But also our aviation specialty team just crushed it this quarter in the U.K. And our retail operation across the United Kingdom did extremely well also. But I just think the whole London-based specialty team, reinsurance aviation just is set phenomenal close to the year. Well, let me just back up to our prepared comments again. It's very, very interesting. First of all, we don't play that much in the high-tech Employee Benefit business, and it's not that big a segment for us in terms of the layoffs you're seeing that are making the newspaper. And as I've said in previous quarters, we're already in the same papers, right? And we all see the same news reports. However, our middle market, core business is doing -- our clients are doing extremely well, and we keep reporting our -- what we're seeing in our midterm endorsements and changes to policies and as we see both our renewals and the audits going forward, our middle market, retail, property casualty benefits business, these people are doing very, very well.  Truck counts are up. Our trucking business is very strong. Our work comp renewals in terms of payrolls are not being diminished. Now that doesn't mean that if there is, in fact, a global recession that it won't impact us, of course, it will. But at this point in time, we're not seeing that. So if you ask me where do we see an impact on that type of growth as we go forward this year. I'll tell you, our plans at present don't count on any recessionary pressure. And that could be wrong. And I would want to comment on that as well. We are not undergoing an organic surge in new hiring. We have a very strong internship. We bring on a very strong number of young people every year. Of course, we're always looking for good solid production hires, but you are not seeing our organic head count surge beyond the M&A activity that Doug just mentioned. Yes, our contingents. Supplementals are not subject typically to profit-sharing arrangements, our contingents are. And to date, I'd say we probably factored nothing in, in terms of having significant increases in our operating loss ratios. I think property could get a lot firmer. I would say in the fourth quarter, it was very firm, in particular, in anything that had to do with Coastal, any area that was exposed to wind and fire. This market in terms of property is very difficult as it exists. And, yes, the changes to reinsurance at 1/1 will filter additional pressure onto the retail buyer. And we are out early telling our retail buyers about this. And it is going to get more difficult in what is already a very extremely difficult situation. Mark, I don't have a number on that yet. I just think that it's possible that in order to pay for some of these property increases, other lines are going to have to be tagged. And I think I'll be able to feel that since it maybe have a better number around that at the end of the first quarter. And I may be wrong on that. At this point, I'm not being told by our carriers that that's happening. I think that it will be achievable with existing capacity. I was very pleased -- our reinsurance people were telling us in late November and December, early December that they were very fearful some of these placements just weren't going to get done. And that is a nightmare on all sides of the equation. And in fact, really, really pleased and proud of the team that did the work to bring the programs together for our clients as January got going here. So I think on existing capacity, of course, the largest renewal season is now winding down. It's not over, but it's winding down. And so I do think the increases going forward could come off existing capacity. However, having said that, any additional capacity would be very welcome and will be utilized quickly and would add to that. All right. Then let me just add a few comments as I wrap up. I want to thank you again for joining us this evening. Obviously, I'm very pleased with our '22 financial performance. I am still very excited about our future. I want to thank our clients for their continued trust, our 43,000-plus colleagues for their passion, hard work and dedication. And finally, I need to mention our carrier partners. They do play an integral role in meeting our clients' insurance and risk management needs. And we look forward to speaking with you all again at our March IR Day. So thank you for being with us, and we'll talk to you then."

            "name": "Douglas Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. A fantastic fourth quarter to close out another outstanding year. Today, I'll start with our earnings release, touching on organic margins and the Corporate segment shortcut table. Next, I'll walk you through our CFO commentary document, point out a few items for the next quarter and also provide a first look at our typical modeling helpers for '23 then I'll finish up with some comments on cash, M&A capacity and capital management. Okay. Let's flip to Page 3 of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment organic table. All in brokerage organic of 11%, above the 9% to 9.5% that we foreshadowed in December. Two drivers of the upside. First, as Pat just discussed, we had a really strong finish within our P&C and reinsurance brokerage operations. Second, our annual update of 606 assumptions added about 1 point to our headline organic. Recall under ASC 606, we must routinely update our assumptions related to the amount of services provided before and after the placement of an insurance policy. Based on our most recent operational analysis, metrics and time studies, more of our services being provided at the time of placement and more of the post placement service is being handled faster in our lower-cost centers of excellence. This causes less of our revenue to be deferred and thus, we recognized an additional $15 million of revenue in the quarter. That is a small amount relative to our total deferred revenue balance nearly $435 million, but it does cause an additional point of organic. So we're the call out today.  From an expense perspective, our updated 606 assumptions also caused some additional compensation expense to be recognized during the quarter. The punchline of all this, our fourth quarter organic revenues, EBITDAC and net earnings got a small boost and adjusted EBITDAC margin was not significantly impacted. So 11% headline organic, 10% controlling for 606 and 120 basis points of margin expansion, that's a terrific quarter. Looking forward to '23, we're currently not seeing a slowdown in our clients' business activity. We're not seeing signs of price moderation from the carriers, and we still have loss cost inflation and labor market imbalances. Add that to our client for sales and service culture, we are still seeing '23 organic in that 7% to 9% range, as we stated during our December IR Day. Same with our margin outlook for '23. We are still comfortable with our December commentary. We think we can deliver about 50 basis margin expansion at 6% organic and fiduciary investment income could be a nice margin sweetener provided there isn't a surge in wage and cost inflation. One other [indiscernible] heads up for '23. On December 20, we announced our acquisition of Buck. The business operations operates at an adjusted EBITDAC margin around 20%, so please make sure a portion of your pick for future M&A revenues reflects that versus what you might pick for our other mergers. Moving on to the Risk Management segment and the organic table at the bottom of Page 6. You'll see 15.6% organic in the fourth quarter and full year organic in excess of 13%. Some of that growth this year comes from our clients' business activity still rebounding out of the pandemic and getting back to levels they saw before the pandemic. Accordingly, for '23, we're seeing organic revenue approaching 10%. Flipping to Page 7. The Risk Management adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.3% in the quarter and 18.5% for the full year. We see a nice step-up in '23 with margins around 19% even as we continue to make investments to enhance the client experience and in analytics and tools to drive better claim outcomes. Another year of double-digit growth and margin expansion would be another terrific year. Turning to Page 8 to the Corporate segment shortcut table. In total, adjusted results were at the favorable end of our December IR day forecast. You also see 2 non-GAAP adjustments this quarter. First, our M&A transaction costs of $5 million after tax, mostly related to Buck and a little relates to Willis treaty. And second, as we discussed previously, you'll see a $31 million after-tax gain related to legal and tax matters. Now shifting to our CFO commentary document we posted on our IR website, starting on Page 3. As for fourth quarter, you'll see most of the brokerage and risk management items are close to our December IR day estimates. On the right-hand side of the page, we're providing our first look at '23. A couple of things worth highlighting: First, FX. With last year's midyear strengthening in the U.S. dollar, you'll see some volatility in how FX will impact our brokerage and risk management results in first half versus second half of '23. Please make sure to consider these impacts as you're planning your models. Second, our adjusted tax rate. With the U.K. corporate tax rate increasing to 25% effective April 1, we're providing our current estimate for full year '23 tax rate. More of an impact to our Brokerage segment than it is to our Risk Management segment, given the size of our U.K. retail London specialty and reinsurance brokerage operation. And one other thing. The left side of this page might be a nice reference when making your picks for quarterly margins given our quarterly seasonality. And finally, when you do make your margin picks, recall we were still in the Omicron portion of the pandemic during the first quarter of '22. So we're not expecting as much margin expansion in first quarter as we are in the second, third and fourth quarter of '23. Okay. Moving to Page 5. This page is here to highlight the incremental cash flows from our clean energy investments over the coming years. And remember, those come through the cash flow statement, not the P&L. You'll also see that we have $773 million of available tax credits as of December 31, '22. And that we forecast using about $180 million to $200 million in '23 and that should step up a bit in '24 and each later year. That's a really nice cash flow boost to help fund our M&A.  The way I look at the math, it might say that an additional $773 million of free cash, combined maybe another $70 million of recurring EBITDAC at that 10 to 11x multiple, which would then have a nice arbitrage for our current trading multiple. Moving to Page 6 on the rollover revenue table. For the fourth quarter, rollover revenues came in higher than our December IR day guidance. Most of all of that came from reinsurance. Over the last 3 weeks, cedents have been closing their books for '22, and we're getting updated ceded premium figures. That translated into additional commission revenue for '22. For the sake of clarity, nearly all of that upside is excluded from our organic results because it likely relates to pre-December 1, '22, which marked the first year anniversary of the acquisition. And no -- also, please note that not all of that hits the bottom line because of production and incentive comp expense on that additional revenue. That said, it's terrific to get the bump-up.  Staying on Page 6, but moving down to the bottom table. That table shows our actual reinsurance acquisition results. In a transition year, the team overperformed our pro forma expectation. That's impressive and terrific work by the team. So now let me move to some final comments on cash, capital management and future M&A. At December 31, available cash on hand was about $325 million. Our current cash position, combined with strong expected cash flows and incremental borrowing positions us well for our pipeline of M&A opportunities. In total, we estimate towards $3 billion to fund potential M&A opportunities during '23, which would include paying for Buck. And also yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly dividend by $0.04 per share. That would imply an annual payout of $2.20 per share. That's a 7.8% increase over '22. So with a strong organic outlook, margin expansion opportunities and an ever-growing M&A pipeline, from my vantage point as CFO, we are extremely well positioned for another fantastic year in '23. I'd like to thank the entire Gallagher team for another great quarter and outstanding year. Back to you, Pat. All right. Let me see if I can break that out from memory here. I don't have it in front of me exactly, but when you're talking about being down was at 180 basis points, something like that. Yes. Is that right? I'm just going from memory, Sorry, I'll look it up here. Probably 1/3 of that is due to the continued efficiency that we bring by being able to push work into our lower-cost centers of excellence. I think that we've had some technology wins in that area, too, to help us make our workforce more effective on that and didn't have to put on additional heads as a result of that -- those technology investments. And then I think that when it came to -- the other 1/3 is kind of escaping you right here. So are you asking for the quarter? Are you asking for the full year? Sorry, just so I've got the baseline. For the full year, right? So when I look at rate and exposure, as I did, our new business, we had a terrific new business here. So I'll say that our net new business spread was about 4 points and the rest of that is probably rate and exposure, remember between that. So maybe, again, you think about it, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 net new business over loss business is 1/3, rate was 1/3 and exposure unit growth was 1/3. I think the -- when we give the guidance of 6 points, if we grow organically, 6%, we think we can show about 50 basis points of margin expansion on that. Investment income would be a sweetener to that. to a certain extent. But I don't have a clear line of sight yet on the size of our raise pool and our hiring needs going into next year. We understand our budget. So I can't give you a specific number on it, but you give me a pick on what you think wage inflation is going to be next year to take care of our folks, and I can probably give you that number, but I don't think we're ready yet. I might be able to give you some more of that in March. Right. A couple of things. On the operating expense ratio, it was up in fourth quarter versus '21 fourth quarter, was up about 30 to 40 basis points, let's call it, 40 basis points on that. I think the footnote on that is explaining where it's coming from, mostly travel and entertainment, some consulting use and investments in technology. So I'd say it's probably half of that increase is investments and half of it is just the inflation that we're seeing in travel and consulting costs on that. When you're -- I think the next question was how am I seeing that vis-a-vis next year.  Remember, we were still in the omicron portion of the pandemic in the first quarter. So we are going to see a little more travel and entertainment expense return in our first quarter, but we don't see it being up significantly in the second, third and fourth quarters. So we're looking at 50 basis points of expansion next year. Most of that will come in the later 3 quarters than the first quarter. And what was there was another piece of your question, Greg? Yes, it's pretty much so across all of them, Greg -- there is no standout in there anywhere that's a laggard in there. Yes. So it will be part of our Brokerage segment and our Employee Benefit operation. Greg, we don't think we're going to close that in the first quarter. We think it's more of a second quarter close at this point. I don't really have a good quarterly spread that I would feel comfortable giving on the call today for that because we have to apply our study on conforming the accounting principles to theirs, apply our 606 assumptions to it. So I need a little more time to work through that. And we just signed the deal 30 days ago, and I just need to until March to give you that quarterly spread. Not really. Yes, we usually see a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter as people push to get things done by the end of the year, sometimes that's driven by tax or other financial planning that the sellers want to get done. But if there is a noticeable change in the market. I would say that we feel very good about our pipeline right now. There are some names on there that are really nice to have looking at us. So a little bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter, naturally, change in market competitiveness a little bit. But I also think it's going to be pretty strong in the first couple of quarters of the year relative to what we saw this year, in particular. I think it's mix right now is what we're seeing is -- I think that you're seeing some pretty high performing names on the list where the growth factors are a little bit bigger than maybe they were in the past. But one turn on that, it wouldn't overly react to it one way or another. Yes. We're assuming that we're paying raises this year about similar to what we have for the last 2 years. So that's in the numbers. Also in that, I did a little -- I did a small vignette during the December IR Day. If you really look underneath that, there's probably 10 or 15 basis points as we toggle to Software as a Service that might be against that 50 basis points, too. So maybe it's more like 60 basis points, but in the accounting of where that expense gets charged does influence that a little bit. You and I talked about that in December, I think, too. Yes. Well, a lot of that -- remember those numbers are impacted considerably by our M&A program. So as we close the year out strong on M&A, those numbers would be in the December numbers and not in last year's December numbers, and that would impact the quarter 2. Are you're talking about the carriers loss trends? Right, that relates to the contingents. Yes. If you think about -- remember, our fourth quarter, Ian hit right at the beginning of the fourth quarter, there were replacements that were done in October and November that hadn't had the full impact of the $70 billion loss."

Patrick Gallagher: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call for today is Doug Howell, our CFO; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. Before I get to my comments about our financial results, I'd like to acknowledge the damage of devastation caused by Hurricane Ian. Our professionals are working diligently to help our clients sort through their coverages, file claims and ultimately get losses paid. At the same time, many of our own colleagues are doing the same for themselves. Our hearts go out to all of those impacted by the storm. In the aftermath of events such as in the insurance industry's role and response is paramount to help families, businesses and communities restore their lives. I'm really honored to be part of an industry with such important responsibility. Okay, on to my comments regarding our third quarter financial performance. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 15% growth in revenue, 8.4% organic growth, net earnings growth of 12%, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 15%, and we completed or signed 7 mergers in the quarter totaling about $60 million of annualized revenues. Another fantastic quarter by our team. Let me give you some more detail on our third quarter performance, starting with our Brokerage segment. During the quarter, reported revenue growth was 16%. Of that, 7.8% was organic. That's right in line with our September IR Day expectation when we previewed there would be about a full point of headwind related to timing from a tough '21 comparison within our benefits business. Acquisition rollover revenues were $162 million. Net earnings growth was 11%, and we posted adjusted EBITDAC margins of 32.3%, a bit better than our IR Day guidance. Another excellent quarter for our brokerage team. Focusing on brokerage segment organic, it continues to be broad-based by both business and geography. Let me walk you around the world and provide some more detailed commentary, starting with our P/C operations. Our U.S. retail business posted 9% organic with strong new business and solid client retention, both consistent with last year's third quarter. Risk Placement Services, our U.S. wholesale operations, also posted organic of 9%. This includes more than 20% organic in open brokerage and about 5% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business was strong at more than 27% of prior year revenue, and retention was consistent with last year's third quarter. Shifting outside the U.S. Our U.K. businesses posted organic of 15% with excellent new business production and retention. Australia and New Zealand combined organic was 9%. New business production remained very strong and retention improved relative to last year's third quarter. Canada was up 13% organically and continues to benefit from renewal premium increases, robust new business and consistent retention. Moving to our Employee Benefit Brokerage and Consulting business. As I mentioned earlier, as we signaled last quarter and again at our September IR Day, our benefits business faced a tough organic comparison this quarter. Recall that due to last year's upward development in covered lives as employers resumed hiring coming out of the depths of the pandemic. Leveling for that, our benefits business organic was about 3%. And that's consistent with our IR Day expectations and includes strong growth with our HR benefits consulting units and solid growth in our international businesses. And before I conclude my organic comments, let me give you a quick update on our December 21 reinsurance acquisition. Third quarter revenues were right in line with our expectations and while not included in our Brokerage segment organic yet after controlling for breakage prior to closing, organic was around 8%. That's just outstanding. With expected revenues and EBITDAC for full year unchanged, reinsurance continues to be a fantastic story. So headline Brokerage segment all in organic of 7.8% and around 9% after controlling for the benefits comparison either way, an outstanding organic quarter. Next, let me give you some thoughts on our current PC market environment, starting in the primary insurance market. Overall, global third quarter renewal premiums, that's both rate and exposure combined, were up 10.5%. That's a bit higher than renewal premium change in the first half of '22. As for rate, most lines of business and geographies saw increases in third quarter, similar to the first half with only one exception being D&O, where rates are now closer to flat, but our customers are buying more limits. Additionally, our customers' third quarter business activity was not reflective of any economic slowdown. In fact, revenue related to third quarter midterm policy endorsements, audits and cancellations combined were above third quarter '21 levels. Looking ahead, thus far in October, midterm policy endorsements and audit adjustments remain higher than last year's level, and renewal premium increases are also consistent with the third quarter. But remember, our job is to help our clients mitigate that overall 10% increase in premiums by developing creative risk management solutions that fit their budgets. Let me move to the reinsurance market. Let me provide you with some broad observations regarding the upcoming '23 and reinsurance renewal season. First, there is no question that rates, terms and conditions will vary depending on geography, individual seed and loss history, risk characteristics and line of business. Second, pricing on peak zone property catastrophe cover is moving higher. And tightening terms and conditions are highly likely. Third, while we haven't witnessed the impact of Hurricane Ian spill over to non-property lines yet, it is possible that, that could happen if there's a broad shift in reinsurance risk appetite and capacity deployment strategies. Fourth and finally, the amount of property reinsurance capacity available is an open question. Some reinsurance providers had already planned to pull back their cat capacity priority in. And now it is likely the significant level of ILS capital to be trapped into 1/1 renewals, further pressuring potential capacity. Ultimately, supply will depend on expected returns from changes in pricing, terms and conditions and perhaps expected returns will reach a level that will attract additional reinsurance capital. While we have yet to see any significant third-party capital into the market, given ILS capital can move quickly, there is still time before the January renewal season. This will play out over the next 2 months. But at this point, it seems the stage is set for a hard or even harder renewals market as we enter the important 1/1 renewal season. Reinsurance conditions will no doubt influence primary markets in 2023 and carriers we're already facing rising loss costs in property and casualty lines. We see good reason for our carrier partners to continue to underwrite retail and wholesale risks cautiously for the foreseeable future. Moving to our Employee Benefit Brokerage and Consulting business. U.S. labor market conditions remained tight, but broadly favorable. During August, while U.S. employers reduced job openings by 1 million positions, there are still more than 10 million job openings according to the most recent data. And the level of open jobs remains well above the nearly 6 million people unemployed in looking for work as of the end of September. So we see tight U.S. labor market conditions lingering for some time and expect strong demand for our HR and benefits consulting services to continue as businesses prioritize, attracting, retaining and motivating their workforce. Let me wrap up my Brokerage segment organic comments with 3 terrific quarters in the books. Year-to-date, brokerage organic growth stands at 9.3%. And as I look to the fourth quarter, I see us posting another quarter above 9% that would deliver a fantastic year. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. During the third quarter, we completed 6 new tuck-in brokerage mergers representing about $20 million of estimated annualized revenues. We also signed another merger late in the third quarter, representing an additional $40 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have about 50 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing nearly $400 million of annualized revenue. We know not all of these will close, however, we believe we'll get our fair share. Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic growth was 12.2%, a strong finish to the quarter, pushed organic a bit higher than our IR day expectation. We also continue to benefit from increases in new arising claims across general liability and core workers' compensation during the quarter. That's both on an organic existing client basis and also due to some recent new client wins, including the significant insurance company client we added to our fast-growing insurance carrier practice. And profitability remains excellent. Third quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was 18.2%, in line with our expectations. That would have been closer to 19% without the impact from the new large client ramp-up that we spoke about at our September IR meeting. Looking forward for the fourth quarter, we believe organic revenue growth will be about 10% and adjusted EBITDAC margins between 18.5% and 19% that would close out a great year for the Gallagher Bassett team. And I'll conclude my remarks with some thoughts on our bedrock culture. October 2 marked Gallagher's 95th anniversary. I took note on that day that our teams were hard at work helping our clients assess damage, file claims and ultimately start the repairing and the building process for Ian. And if not directly assisting individuals and communities impacted many Gallagher colleagues around the world donated their own money to help those impacted by Ian. What a fitting way for us to solidly celebrate this incredible milestone. My grandfather would be proud of the company founded to employees that embody the culture he started in the industry in which we toll. It's our people's actions and challenging times that bring our unique Gallagher culture to the forefront, a culture that we believe will thrive for another 95 years.  Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll touch on organic and margins using our earnings release. Then I'll move to the CFO commentary document that we post to our website and make some comments on our corporate segment. I'll conclude my prepared remarks with some thoughts on M&A, debt and cash.  During my comments today, I'll also provide some thoughts on our fourth quarter and some first thinking around how we are seeing 2023 now that we have started our budget process. Okay. Starting with the earnings release in the Brokerage segment organic table on Page 3. Headline all-in brokerage organic of 7.8%. That's over 9% when controlling for the tough benefits compare, brings us to a strong 9.3% year-to-date organic growth. When I look at our organic quarter-to-quarter, it's fairly consistent in that 9% range. We boast 9.6% organic in the first quarter, about the same in the second quarter when you exclude that infrequent large live sale we discussed last quarter. Now we're at about 9% here in the third quarter when adjusting for the benefits headwind. and It's looking like over 9% in the fourth quarter. That would deliver a full year 22% organic above 9%, a little noisy on the quarters, but very consistent and actually a fantastic performance by our sales team. As for 2023, early feel is in that 7% to 9% organic range for our Brokerage segment.  Next turning to Page 5, to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Recall, this is a year of quarterly margin change volatility due to the roll-in impact of the acquired reinsurance operations, expenses returning as we come out of the pandemic and the impact of a stronger dollar. Specifically, we've been saying to expect year-over-year margins to be up 50 basis points in first quarter, down 100 in the second quarter, down 125 basis points in the third quarter and up about 125 basis points in the fourth quarter. While that was about right for our third quarter, we posted 32.3%, which was in line with our IR day guidance and we are still comfortable with our fourth quarter outlook of around 125 basis points of margin expansion relative to the FX adjusted fourth quarter '21 EBITDAC margin. That would suggest a fourth quarter margin of around 32% at today's FX rates. In the end, since early '22, we've been targeting around 10 to 20 basis points of full year '22 margin expansion. And we're on track to deliver that. More importantly, that would mean we improved margins around 570 basis points since 2019. As we look ahead to '23, we continue to expect margin expansion next year starting around 4% or better organic growth, call it, maybe 50 basis points at 6%. Moving on to the Risk Management segment on Pages 5 and 6. As Pat said, 12.2% organic and 18.2% adjusted margins, both pretty close to our September IR Day expectations. And looking forward, we see these excellent results continuing in the fourth quarter. Organic growth -- revenue growth of about 10% and margins in the mid- to upper 18% range. That would be a full year organic growth of about 12% and full year margins around 18.5%. Looking to '23, we will see the roll in of the new large carrier client, and we have already had a nice new business win in Australia that will end up midyear. Add continued strong new business production, combined with continued growth in newer rising claims, we see organic at least in the high single digits and margins around 19% in '23. All right. Let's shift now to the CFO commentary document. Starting with Page 3, which shows our typical brokerage and risk management modeling helpers. A few things to highlight. First, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our September IR Day. Please take a look at our updated FX guidance for the fourth quarter of '22. As for 2023, perhaps the best start is just to assume what we are projecting for full year '22 repeats in '23, but most of that will be seen in the first half. Second, you'll see our current estimate for fourth quarter integration costs, most of all of this relates to the reinsurance acquisition. The team is making really excellent progress on this and is executing at a faster pace than our original plan. It was terrific to see our new reinsurance colleagues located with our other brokerage operations when I was in London a couple of weeks ago. As for technology and system rebuilds, we still see being done by the end of '23 or early '24. Turning to the Corporate segment on Page 4. Relative to our September outlook, interest in banking, clean energy and M&A costs after adjusting for the large transaction-related expenses, those 3 lines totaled to about the midpoint of our outlook. Within the corporate line, most of the upside was due to some favorable tax items and a favorable FX remeasurement gain. Looking towards the fourth quarter, moving down that page, only one significant change to our outlook. As you'll see in the fourth quarter corporate line and read in Footnote 7 on that Page 4, here in October, we settled a litigation resulting in Gallagher receiving $55 million in cash. Net of litigation costs and taxes, we will record a gain of approximately $35 million, and you'll see a few lines down that we'll adjust that gain out of our GAAP results. As for the cash proceeds, which because of our tax credits is actually closer to $40 million, we'll put that to good work over the next couple of years to fund incremental production hires and make incremental investments in technology. I'll break down our thinking a little more during our December IR day.  Moving now to Page 5, Clean Energy. This page should be familiar to everyone by now. It highlights that we have close to $1 billion of tax credit carryforwards. The pinkish column shows that we expect to however, a $125 million to $150 million of cash flows here in '22, and the peach column shows that we could be even greater in '23 and beyond. And as a reminder, that would come through our cash flow statement, not our P&L.  Turning to Page 6. The top of the page is the rollover revenue table. Third quarter revenues of $162 million, that's right in line with our expectations 6 weeks ago. Shifting to the lower half of the page, this table is an update on our December '21 reinsurance acquisition. Third quarter revenue of $120 million is consistent with our September IR day estimate. As for EBITDAC, a tightening difference between third and fourth quarter. Punchline is full year revenue and EBITDAC should come in very close to our pro forma. That's a really terrific story and great credit to the team. Okay. As to cash and capital management and future M&A. At September 30, available cash on hand was about $500 million, and we've been saying that we might have around $4 billion of M&A capacity in '22 and '23 combined without using stock. That still seems about right to us today. Okay. Those are my comments. Another fantastic quarter and 9 months is in the books, another strong outlook for the fourth quarter, and it's looking like we're well positioned for a terrific year in 2023. Back to you, Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Doug. Operator, if you would, let's open it up for questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please proceed.\nWeston Bloomer : Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first one is on the 7% to 9% organic growth that you're expecting next year. I was hoping if you could kind of expand on what sort of environment you're expecting next year in terms of a potential recession? And then if you can hit that target in a recessionary environment? And then -- maybe just comment on the magnitude of growth you're seeing across maybe P&C operations versus wholesale or international? Just trying to get a sense of how you're getting to that 7% to 9% more granular.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Weston, let me take the recession question. Doug, can take a look at the numbers across -- I think we did a pretty good job of laying out those numbers by division a moment ago. And I think we said we thought they're pretty consistent next year. So I think you look at our prepared remarks, you got that question answered. But the recession one is an interesting one because one of the reasons in our prepared remarks, we talk about what's going on with endorsements is we can daily look at that information to see what's going on in the underlying business of our clients. We can also look at renewal exposure units as they're being put through to the market for renewal. And as you know, when you renew a client, you have to estimate sales and payrolls going forward. So clients are pretty smart. I'm not wanting to basically overpay and then wait for a return of that premium in an audit, 18 months or 15 months after the close of the year. So it's a bit of a yin and yang between the broker, the underwriter and the client as we look at what are those payrolls that we should be providing. We're not seeing a big decrease in sales and payrolls. Renewals are going out the door with perception of their business being okay. And that's verified by the midterm audits and endorsements that we're seeing. So -- I read the Wall Street Journal every day. I read the left-hand column yesterday, the world just came to end, I didn't know it.\nDoug Howell: Well, listen, I think the way we look at it this way, is we're not seeing it in our underlying business today, and we're also viewing if there is a recession in '23. We see that being more like what happened in the early -- in the 1991 period, in the 2000, 2001 period, more of a normal soft landing recession. We do not see a recession next year like the subprime financial shock of '08 and -- '07 and '08 or the pandemic recession that we saw for a few months in '20. Those normal recessions typically last about 2 or 3 quarters. And when we go back to the best we can do to get data back then, we actually performed very well during those light recessions. In this case, I think that next year, if there is -- if anything happens, and we do go into a recession, I think it's going to drive excess demand more than it is to contract supply and we ensure supply. So in our contemplation for next year is a lot like this year, exposure units holding stable, rates going up like we're seeing this year. But I see -- I don't see a lot of change all of a sudden on 1/1 that the world has changed dramatically from what it's been for the last 3 to 6 months, right now. So that's our go-in case. That's how we're preparing our budgets in that range. So that's how we came up with that 7% to 9%.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: But we'll give you more of a reflection on that in December.\nWeston Bloomer : Got it. And just one follow-up there is kind of like a high single, low double-digit growth for reinsurance brokerage kind of the right range as well? And can you remind us how much of that business is more property versus long tail binds?\nDoug Howell: Yes. All right. So yes, in answer to your question, we see reinsurance in that high single-digit range next year. Right now, the best -- remember, you got a lot of treaties that are multi-line. But right now, the best we can tell is pure property is 28%. You put in the package on that, I'd say it might be closer to 40% of the book of business. And then you look at some of our kind of high-risk casualty lines, maybe you've got a book that's -- 60% of it is facing a kind of a tough renewal season.\nWeston Bloomer : Great. And then just one more. On the commentary around 50 bps of margin based on 6% organic, does that contemplate a potential pickup in discretionary spending inflation may be offset by higher fiduciary income? Or is that just core expansion net of any items?\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think for 2023, and again, I'll give you some more here in December, there will be an upside from investment income. That -- not all of that will hit the bottom line because there could be some incremental inflation that we see in some of our numbers. Remember, about 80% of our business, we don't believe has significant exposure to headline inflation. And like we said last at our IR Day or on an earlier call, about 20% of our expenses, they do have some inflation pressures on it. But in our opinion, there will be clearly an upside to that thinking as a result of incremental investment income next year. But I still need to work through that math over the next couple of months.\nWeston Bloomer : I am working through it too. \nDoug Howell : Our next question is from Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. \nMike Zaremski : Just a follow-up on the investment income levels. And are you so -- is the guidance that you provided kind of inclusive of using the current level of interest rates or the curve? Does that make sense?\nDoug Howell: You're talking about the '23?\nMike Zaremski: Yes, '23. Sorry, Doug.\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think that when we look at 6% organic growth with possibly 50 basis points of margin expansion, that does not include a possible upside from incremental investment income, but not all that incremental investment income will likely hit the EBITDA line. It could go to some inflationary pressures on some of our cost base or it could go to some discretionary spend, but it would be upside to that 6 points, 50 basis points outlook.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Understood. Thanks for the clarification. Kind of switching gears a little bit. Just curious, you're not calling out any kind of potential impacts to contingents or shops as a result of the hurricane. I know the new accounting rules came into place a few years ago. Is there anything we should be contemplating that could impact Gallagher in the year to come or maybe even kind of into programs business, if there's a lack of capacity? Just trying to -- one of your peers kind of surprised us a little bit. So just trying to see if there's anything there worth talking about.\nDoug Howell: Our outlook on the impact of Ian to our contingent commissions is $465,000 of impact against our revenues. That has all been fully booked in the numbers that you see here today. We do not believe that would develop differently than that. We just are not that -- we're just not exposed to contingent commissions on operating placements in our book of business.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Great. And lastly, any change in the competitive environment on the M&A side, given there's kind of now a consensus that interest rates may stay higher for longer? Or is it still just very competitive?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No, it's still very, very competitive. And there's a lot of interest out there in our industry still, we're watching that very carefully to see if some of that falls off. You'll see some write-ups recently about the number of deals done coming down a bit. I don't know if that's an early sign that maybe some of the people want to sit on the sideline a bit. But for the deals that we're after right now, the competition is very strong.\nMike Zaremski: So multiples, I was trying to -- I should have been clear. So you don't expect multiples to move south and you're not seeing that?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I hope they do, but we're not yet.\nOperator: Our next question is from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please proceed. \nGreg Peters: So I wanted to go back, Pat, to your comments about the reinsurance market and the reinsurance business and sort of unpack what's going on and get your perspectives because it really feels like we're at the seminal moment in that marketplace where we could be in a hard market, especially for cat-exposed property, but it seems like it's bleeding over into other lines. And -- so the reinsurers haven't been able to get an adequate return on their business. And then now the primary companies are going to be asked to take higher retentions and absolutely pay more on rate online. So I guess my question is, if these 2 partners of yours are getting pressure or profitability pressure, do you foresee a scenario where you actually might get some pressure on commission rates as the market evolves here?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No, I don't think so, Greg. I think it's clear that we earned our money. And that's -- you see that in the market. I mean, it's -- the business has been very stable, I've had a chance to meet with a number of managements. They know exactly every dollar that we're making. There is no hidden factor here anywhere. And we have to do the work that justifies that income level every single day. Now in my experience as a retailer, I'm not a reinsurance person, but a hard market makes you incredibly more valuable. In a soft market in the retail business, some person with a shingle out to get a quote and beat you, when you're sitting with someone in a hard market, you are talking strategy, man. You are not talking about what's going to happen to my comp premium. You're talking about, am I going to get GL cover. And that's going right down to personal lines. I've got tons of friends, as you can imagine, in South Florida. Am I going to get homeowners next year? I don't know. I mean, I think you will, but you're going to pay more and they know it. Now that, I think, trusted adviser works its way all the way back to reinsurance, and this is not a time when these carriers are going to put a lot of emphasis on how much we get paid when they're looking at trying to get returns literally on hundreds of millions of dollars of ratings.\nDoug Howell: Yes, Greg, I will say this. It's been 20 years since I've been CFO of insurance companies, but right now, this is a time where my reinsurance brokers would be the most important people to have in my office with their skills, their capabilities, and this is a time where they really earn their money.\nGreg Peters: Fair enough. I'm sure it's -- there's a robust conversation happening around all of this stuff. So I wanted to also -- and I know you've commented on this before, but I wanted to pivot and talk about the brokerage business and the pipeline, if we're in a recession, if we go in a recession, blah, blah, blah, it's pretty strong. Can you remind us again just when -- on the risk management piece, how you think that might perform if we go into a soft landing? What kind of -- and I know you've commented on this before, Pat, but just give us some sort of guideposts that we should be thinking about on that.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I mean -- first of all, Greg, as you know, when prices are going up, one of the skills that brought us to the point we are today is the capability of taking people who are -- should be self-insuring into that market. and showing them how to take higher retentions and bringing Gallagher Bassett in. Recessionary work has the same -- now I'm talking about the larger upper middle market. The recession has the same kind of impact, especially if you get a recession, while at the same time, pricing has gone up. They're looking for alternatives. And when I say your alternative is to pay tomorrow instead of today and to really manage your claims hard and work it hard at preventing them, there's a lot better listeners than when the prices are dropping, and that's going right to their bottom line and their private companies and they're happy as a clam. When you get to the larger accounts, these are very sophisticated buyers. And they don't move around based on recessions. Now if there is a recession and our larger clients have a lesser population, they close down shifts, then you'll see claim counts drop. But I don't think you're going to see an impact on that business that happens in the short term, and we'll know well in advance of any kind of a downturn as people start slowing their business down and cutting shifts, we'll be well aware of it. We can probably comment better as we go into the new quarters. We're just not seeing that right now, Greg. I think that's the interesting thing to me. As I said, I read the journal every day, and I'm sitting there and go, okay. And then we test and test and test, and our primary business partners are doing really well. Then we looked at the GB results and claim counts are up. They're not down. So it's -- I get why you're questioning it. I really do get the conundrum. But here's the thing. Doug pointed out that the other recessions we've done well. Clients do not jump in and out of self-insurance. You make that decision to move to taking a big retention and paying your claims. You may have a -- you may see your claim counts go down because hours worked are less, but you're not jumping in on the market. It's a pretty good place to be.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thanks for the answer and I read the journal too. It does seem like the end of the world is imminent, but you guys are posting good results. So congratulations.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Greg. \nOperator: Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, I'm going to head in the opposite direction of talking about a recession. I want to go to the flip side and talk about how good, I guess, 2023 could be. As you had said 6% to 9% organic in September. Today, you're saying 7% to 9% for next year. But we could have a really strong reinsurance market, and it sounds like you have really good exposure on the wholesale side where the market is really firming. So at 80% of your revenue is commission based. So could there be an environment next year where pricing is still firm that Gallagher could print double-digit organic revenue growth?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, from your lips to god's ears, Elyse. If you take a look back at our results in other hard markets, yes, that could happen. I mean, I'm not going to sit here and say no. If capacity dries up, smaller brokers in those environments can't get the job done, reinsurance clearly is -- and look at cap trapital in the ILS market, depending on whether capacity is there or whether capacity comes in, yes, I think you could see a variable -- you could write a bullish story.\nElyse Greenspan: And then assuming, right, Doug, you said at a 6% organic, we could see 50 basis points of margin improvement. So assuming that the base is 7%, right, and it sounds like it could be better than that, so is the base case that we'll see something margin improvement that's above that 50 basis point level next year?\nDoug Howell: I think that it's not linear. If we posted 9%, I don't think you'd have 150 basis points of margin expansion, but you might have 75 to a point, something like that. But I think that -- let us get through this and get through our December, look at our budgets. And some of this is discretionary spending that we might want to make in investing in technologies and other organic growth strategies. But -- yes, I mean, there is a case that, that could happen.\nElyse Greenspan: And then on the M&A side, right, you guys obviously have a good amount of capital flexibility over the next couple of years. it does seem maybe it's because you guys have had such a strong track record of M&A. Deal flow has been a little light relative to historical levels this year. So I know the pipeline is still strong. At what point do you reach that level? Will you consider buying back your shares? Or is it something where deals just ebb and flow depending upon time of year and you guys will give it some time and then maybe consider buybacks?\nDoug Howell: Well, listen, if we ended up with excess capital, our first metric would be is to make sure that we maintain a solid investment grade rating borrowing. With interest rates going up, that's more and more important every day. Second of all, I think that our M&A pipeline is still robust. And the third thing is, remember, the arbitrage that we get on the multiples. And -- more importantly, we're building out the team. We bring more people on our side of the field to go out and compete on every day and create more organic afterwards. So for us, buying back stock is certainly what we can do. It's certainly part of the math, and its part of the story. But I'd like to see us doing more and more M&A every day to put our cash to work at multiples that are -- that deliver arbitrage value to our shareholders. So -- we're out there, we're looking very hard. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I think we've got a ton of opportunities in our pipeline right now.\nElyse Greenspan: Given the strength of the U.S. dollar, are you guys seeing more opportunities for international deals?\nDoug Howell: Well, listen, we've got some pretty good pipelines going on, especially in Canada, Australia and the U.K. right now. So we'd be happy to continue to look at those acquisitions there. And yes, the dollar does have a little bit of an impact on that, but it's not what drives our investment choices.\nOperator: Our next question is from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please proceed. \nYaron Kinar: My first question is on headcount. I noticed there was a nice pickup in headcount, and the one I'm referring to specifically is in Brokerage. I think it's up 7% year-to-date. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what that is going into, what type of roles you're hiring? And secondly, I'm actually -- I was very impressed to see that the comp and benefit ratio is actually coming in year-over-year despite the increase in headcount. So is there a catch-up that we should expect? Or how are you keeping that number down?\nDoug Howell: All right. So a couple of things -- you got a couple of things to unpack. But first, let's talk about the increase in the headcount. We have actually substantially increased our head count in our offshore centers of excellence. As you know, we've been talking about it for 15 years now. We think that that's a terrific spot to improve the quality of the offer of our insurance offerings. And as a result, we're ramping up significantly more in offshore right now that can do that work for us. And the -- so we're up considerably in that. So that's what's driving the metric you're seeing is mostly offshore resources there. When it comes to the opportunity -- the drop in the comp ratio this quarter, some of that has to do with bonus timing. If you recall last quarter, I said we were a little ahead on our bonus accruals. So we didn't have to post quite as much this quarter, which probably offset some of the -- well, we did have a little bit of inflation in our rates pool. We gave away another $8 million this year, something like that in that -- in the raise pool this year. What's offsetting that is the timing of the bonus.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. And I'm curious what led to the increase in the organic growth estimate for '23, at least the bottom end of the range from 6% to 7%? What changed in the last 6 weeks?\nDoug Howell: Well, listen, I think that Ian has brought a different tone in the marketplace. I think you're seeing some reports of reserve strengthening across line. You saw the reinsurance outlook we've talked about -- and remember, the reason why we got to 6% to 9% is we were saying that 23 felt somewhere between 2019 and 2022 and '19 happen to be 6% organic growth. So in the context of the comment in September, relative to 2 different years. And now as we're getting closer on our budget process and really looking at what we're starting to see in the renewal pipeline, we thought we could tighten that range up a little bit.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Also, Yaron, I think that before in, it was clear that loss cost and verdicts and what have you, we're putting pressure on our carriers. Today, we look across the loss on the cat level and wonder if they're not going to bleed into the casualty lines. And I've had some conversations with some of our reinsurance pros, we think that that's a very good possibility. If that happens, that will be -- that will benefit from that as well.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. Maybe 1 last one, and following up on Greg's question. I guess, in what markets, what kind of environment do you typically see some pressure on commission rates or maybe clients trying to shift over to fees?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Primarily in the retail market, as accounts go from being, say, upper middle, middle market, where typically, you'll have about 85% to 90% of your clients, probably, we're 100% transparent. This is their choice. We have an adult conversation. They know we collect contingents. Let's not go back to 2004 and get me all in trouble, again, for accepting convenience and supplemental. They're all disclosed. This is client choice. And so as they get a little bigger, if they bring in a risk manager, that type of thing, then there's usually a shift to fee and we're happy with that.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: Just had a question on the investment income side, the fiduciary income. Could you just quantify how much that generated this quarter? I think you've said in the past it's $40 million for every 100 basis points move in short-term rates. But just wanted to -- just to double check what the benefit was to revenues this quarter? And then maybe just talk about how that impacted margins? How much of it fell to the bottom line?\nDoug Howell: Okay. I'll take that in a couple of different bites. This quarter, let's call it, $12.5 million that we had as additional investment income as a result of rate changes. Then you're asking how much of that fell to the bottom line. Maybe a better way for me to do this is to take a look at what does it mean for full year. If you recall at the beginning of the year, what we said is -- since when we were sitting in January, we looked back and we had said that we had posted about 550 basis points of margin expansion. And when we looked out and that was over 2 years. Then we said, if we look forward, again, I'm standing in January of 2022, we said that we might be able to get margin expansion of 10 to 20 basis points on organic from about 8% here in '22. So what's happened since that expectations. We're still looking at 10 to 20 basis points of margin expansion. But organic is running a point better and, let's say, investment income between this year that might be up, let's say, $30 million more of investment income in the year. So that's about $80 million more of revenues this year. And so the way I look at it is, where did that go? Where did the $80 million of revenue go? Well, first of all, we dropped -- we're going to drop one-third of that to the bottom line. So that leaves $50 million to $53 million of additional revenues. Well, we have to pay our producers field leadership and support that. Usually, that runs about 45% of the revenue on that organic of $50 million, call that $23 million. So now we're down to explain where did $30 million go as a result of incremental organic and incremental investment income, again, relative to our outlook at the beginning of the year. Well, I can tell you that we spent about $10 million on incremental hiring, some incremental raises and some incremental incentive comp this year. Maybe it's one-third. And we also know that we -- about $10 million went to incremental travel and entertainment expense. Now that's mostly due to inflation, and it's not due to increased trips versus our expectation. Again, this is against our expectation at the beginning of the year. And then finally, we spent an extra $10 million on IT betterment projects than probably we would have expected at the beginning of the year because we have the bandwidth in order to implement those projects. So for me, sitting here relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, I think it's a really terrific outcome. And what I'm really proud of is the team has done a great job this year. They have been disciplined in their travel and they've been selected in their value-added efforts that they're bringing to the clients. And they've been pretty wise about other IT investments. And yet to still deliver 10 to 20 basis points of margin expansion this year in an inflationary environment on top of the 550 that we had delivered in the previous two years I think it's a pretty darn good year, in my opinion. So relative to expectation, that's a long-winded answer -- but I think it gives you a perspective on incremental investment income and incremental organic relative to where we were sitting at the beginning of the year. And remember, we still -- at the beginning of the year, we had the Omicron crisis going on, and we were still in the depths of the pandemic. So we still have done our way out of those pandemic expenses returning along the way. So a long story, long answer, but I hope it gets you to where you need to go.\nDavid Motemaden: Yes, that definitely did. That's really helpful. I guess maybe just switching gears to the reinsurance deal and how that's been going. The organic, I think, accelerated a point to 8% this quarter from 7% in 2Q. I guess -- high single digits in '23 feels may be a little conservative. But maybe could you just talk about the range of outcomes around that high single digit? And I guess what's stopping it from being well above that just given the market that you're experiencing there?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: You're dealing with the most sophisticated buyers in the market. And as Doug just said a bit ago, when he was buying reinsurance, he wasn't messing around worrying about what the guy or gal is getting paid. The point is, this is talking at the essence of their capital, the returns, how they're going to balance out the demand, you've got a supply and demand imbalance. It's looking like it's coming down the path at being very substantial. They want to be good players. They want to take advantage of it. They want to make sure that they get good returns. And so it's good returns that ultimately hopefully bring in more capacity. But these buyers are very sophisticated. They'll pay us more money. I mean, the question earlier on was are they going to keep paying us what they're used to paying us. And they'll pay us more money, but it's not -- this is not a linear progression. I get down to the bad policies and into the lower middle market, it's linear. Price is up 10%. We're going to help the client reduce that by moving deductibles around, dropping umbrella limits, et cetera. But by and large, policy by policy, we're going to get that commission. That's not the case in reinsurance.\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think it's a little bit of a -- I wouldn't say it's a symmetrical bell curve, but around 8% -- I thought -- 6% to 10% on that. So maybe it's 2 points on either side of it, and that probably favors the bull case on that more than the bare case on it.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just 1 more. You mentioned that you don't expect a recession. I don't want to be a Debbie Downer here, but if there is one like there was in the early '90s or early 2000s, have you guys given any thoughts on what organic growth would be in that type of scenario?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I think Doug did a very good job, sure he did, of taking it back in time. I mean, go back and take -- our results are public going back to '84. I think we do extremely well in good times and bad times. Certainly, recessions are not good for brokers. Sales and payrolls are what drive our premiums. So there's no question that if sales and payrolls go down, we'll feel the impact of that. Having said that, people get more interested in listening to us talking to them about how our professionalism, our capabilities in our niches and what have you, you can help them deal with this, the local brokers who takes the hit.\nDoug Howell: Yes. I would say, listen, if we get into a recession that you wanted to refer to as you being a downer on, that type of recession, we're still in an inflating rate environment, and we're not seeing a slowdown on that. When it comes to the contraction of exposure units, I'm not seeing trucks just come out of the fleet. They may not be running quite as much, and I know there's a mileage adjustment on it, but I'm not completely convinced that the stuff that we insure will just all of a sudden evaporate next year. Might have to -- they may take different covers on it. They may take some additional deductibles. When you're also looking at an environment, if you get into a recession, that will help us on our employee retention because they will stay with a good company, versus jumping for a new opportunity. So when those 3 or 4 things applied, rate increases, stable workforce a flight to quality and what people are looking for in terms of their broker, I see us performing very well in that environment. If you want me to pick a number in there, if we have a downer I'd be hard pressed to see how it would be less than 5% organic growth.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. \nRobert Cox: I just had one question. I noticed open brokerage accelerated to 20% versus 15% last quarter. And I was just hoping you could talk about what inflected quarter-over-quarter and how you see open brokerage and the E&S market broadly trending from here?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: The E&S market is on fire. And I think you're seeing more premiums move there, freedom of rate, freedom of form, clients need, cover everything from small accounts to large accounts. That's why we're seeing so much interest in terms of people investing in that market. That -- the primary markets, quite honestly, are not as flexible as the E&S markets are able to move at the pace that they can move, and they are in a tough market sucking business out of the primaries. Did that answer your question, Rob?\nRobert Cox: Yes. Very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mark Hughes with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\nMark Hughes: Thank you, good afternoon. Pat, you talked about the potential spillover to non-property lines from the hardness of the reinsurance market. Have you seen that in the past, I just wonder how much influence the cat property business is going to have on some of the other casualty lines, but I hear what you're saying. Just sort of curious to hear more about it.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Let me caution because I've been a retailer in my whole life. But for the last year, I've had a chance to spend a good bit of time with our reinsurance folks and do anything I can to learn that business and I talked about this at length in the last quarter. And it has happened in the past. I can't give you dates, times and amounts or percent.  But -- yes, when you have a capital situation where you need to increase the pricing and you can add cat loads on other lines of coverage, you'll do that when you have to -- now again, I can't say to you that this is exactly what travelers or hyper did in this year given this situation or what have you. I can't take you back to Andrew or something like that or even Katrina.  But what the team is telling me is that it's very likely, given the dearth of our capacity and the need -- because of the supply and demand imbalance, the need for more rate, that their other lines are selling that are likely to take in advance as well. And sorry that I'm not more specific about that. I'm learning along with you.\nMark Hughes: No. No, interesting. And then any shading -- you talked about the economy is still looking good in terms of exposure units and endorsements. Any differentiation you see between larger accounts, middle market, smaller accounts?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No. And that's the thing that's -- I keep referring to the Wall Street Journal, sorry, but I mean I read it and I sit there and I go, okay, and then I come back and I talk to our data people and they're like, no, I'm not seeing it. I can't also can't break it and say, well, construction is in the tank and retail is going through the roof or trucking is really hurting now and something -- so -- and we've checked things like our marine business. What's happening with cargo, cargo seems to be holding up and if there's any decrease in cargo, then cruise ships are, I mean, going through the roof. So it's kind of a -- it's a weird time based on what we read and what we see in our -- and these are not anecdotal stores. These are higher data points that I've got, and I can get them every day. And broad geographic, solid, continued business growth is what we're seeing. You fall off a cliff? I guess. We're just not seeing it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America.\nJosh Shanker: Yes. Some of the people asked about competition for deals. I just want to talk about debt. And when I think about private equity being one of your competitors, is the marketplace different for them if they have to borrow at higher costs? Is it still debt generally cheap in your mind? And so we're not at the market where that's a consideration. How do you think about their role in their appetite in a higher interest rate environment?\nDoug Howell: Yes, we kind of signaled that early on. Their appetite is still strong right now. But when you're adding an extra 300 basis points of debt cost into the structure does change return expectations. And I think that we're really not competing on price when we come to these deals, Josh, we're really competing on capabilities. And we win on every day. If somebody decides our prices aren't dissimilar to what they're offering. That maybe be a turn higher, but people just have chosen that they don't want to be in an organization with increased capabilities or resources. So this will cause a compression of pricing by the PEs, it will probably come down to where we're comfortable with pain. And I think we should excel in that then because now it isn't about price. It's entirely about capabilities.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, dream with me a little here, Josh. I mean, yes, I think what Doug meant is that our price is similar to our competitors. Yes, multiples over the last five years have expanded substantially. Prices are higher for these deals. But money was free. So now you start paying for that money, and I'm not hoping for a recession, and we don't see one, but show a little slowdown in there. And maybe that annuity isn't as strong as it was before. Our lever is about 2.3 times EBITDA. We've got competitors in the market that are happy to be at 9 times. I'm sorry, at some point, the music has got to stop and all the chairs aren't going to be full.\nJosh Shanker: And if you think over a 20-, 30-year base, I mean, 4% tenure, it's not really that high. I mean, we'll see where it goes from here. But Doug seems to have more confidence that maybe they're able to go away. But if we're at the peak here and we stay here for a while, isn't going to scare them away, I suppose. I'm obviously they're going to pay more than what the 10-year is. But it's got to go higher really to cause their exit, I guess. Am I right now?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes, I'd agree with that. The returns have been outstanding. I agree with that.\nOperator: Our final question is from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please proceed. \nRyan Tunis: I first just wanted to say that the $55 million good guy, that's a nice line. I can't remember the last time in broker land, you had a below-the-line item that is somehow went in the right direction. I think some of your competitors might even count that as organic.\nDoug Howell: Yes. Go ahead, Ryan.\nRyan Tunis: But -- yes, Doug, take your time spending it. We don't need it to lean on margins in '23. But I just had one bigger picture question, I guess, on margins. So organic has been really soft for the past couple of years. And obviously -- but I mean, it could have not been strong, too, in which case I also don't think your expense growth would have been as high as it's been. So there seems to be some element of clearly, the organic has allowed you guys to have -- I want to make sure I'm thinking about this right, like kind of an investment cycle. So I'm just curious, is that the right way to think about it? Like, has the strong organic allowed you to kind of potentially pull forward some investing you had to do. And I'm just kind of curious, maybe some of the capabilities that you guys have been able to take on I guess, to improve the organization over the past couple of years that you wouldn't have if we were any more than a 4% organic growth environment?\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think you've got your notes right in it. And I think if you go back and you listen to our IR Days, these earnings calls, we get an hour to talk to you, but during our IR Days, you hear our 5 or 6 division leaders talk about all the investments you listen to the first 5 minutes or 6 minutes of their prepared remarks. They're talking about all the value-added features and client-centric enhancements that we're doing in our business. And we're spending a lot of money on that. We've talked about Gallagher Drive. We've talked about SmartMarket, we've talked about Gallagher Submit. We've talked about our niche resources. If you look at our content that's out there, all of that is investment and we're adding to it every year. So we are running a business right now that has a substantial amount of investment in it to make us better. I think it's showing up in our organic to be real honest. I think the reason why we perform well on organic as we continue to make investments into our production and our sales and niche capabilities our service. 15 years ago, we didn't know how long it took us to turn around a set right now, we turn around 99.9% of them within one hour of request because of the investments that we've made to better the service. Those type of things are just in our blood at this point. And it's in our operating side, yet, we're still posting terrific margins on it.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: So to add to that, I would say take a look at our internship, we're very proud of the fact that this summer, we had 500 young people look at our business. And these are paid interns. These aren't interns that come to work for free, and that's a U.S.-based number. If we take the people outside the U.S., it's probably closer to 600. I don't know another organization investing in the future of their people like that in our business or, frankly, another business. So I'm very proud of that. Thanks, Ryan, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. We really appreciate this evening. We had an excellent third quarter. We're well on our way to delivering a fantastic year of financial performance. I need to thank more than 42,000 colleagues around the globe for their hard work and dedication to our clients. We look forward to speaking with you again in person in December at our Investment Day in New York. Thanks again, everybody. Have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Doug Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll touch on organic and margins using our earnings release. Then I'll move to the CFO commentary document that we post to our website and make some comments on our corporate segment. I'll conclude my prepared remarks with some thoughts on M&A, debt and cash.  During my comments today, I'll also provide some thoughts on our fourth quarter and some first thinking around how we are seeing 2023 now that we have started our budget process. Okay. Starting with the earnings release in the Brokerage segment organic table on Page 3. Headline all-in brokerage organic of 7.8%. That's over 9% when controlling for the tough benefits compare, brings us to a strong 9.3% year-to-date organic growth. When I look at our organic quarter-to-quarter, it's fairly consistent in that 9% range. We boast 9.6% organic in the first quarter, about the same in the second quarter when you exclude that infrequent large live sale we discussed last quarter. Now we're at about 9% here in the third quarter when adjusting for the benefits headwind. and It's looking like over 9% in the fourth quarter. That would deliver a full year 22% organic above 9%, a little noisy on the quarters, but very consistent and actually a fantastic performance by our sales team. As for 2023, early feel is in that 7% to 9% organic range for our Brokerage segment.  Next turning to Page 5, to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Recall, this is a year of quarterly margin change volatility due to the roll-in impact of the acquired reinsurance operations, expenses returning as we come out of the pandemic and the impact of a stronger dollar. Specifically, we've been saying to expect year-over-year margins to be up 50 basis points in first quarter, down 100 in the second quarter, down 125 basis points in the third quarter and up about 125 basis points in the fourth quarter. While that was about right for our third quarter, we posted 32.3%, which was in line with our IR day guidance and we are still comfortable with our fourth quarter outlook of around 125 basis points of margin expansion relative to the FX adjusted fourth quarter '21 EBITDAC margin. That would suggest a fourth quarter margin of around 32% at today's FX rates. In the end, since early '22, we've been targeting around 10 to 20 basis points of full year '22 margin expansion. And we're on track to deliver that. More importantly, that would mean we improved margins around 570 basis points since 2019. As we look ahead to '23, we continue to expect margin expansion next year starting around 4% or better organic growth, call it, maybe 50 basis points at 6%. Moving on to the Risk Management segment on Pages 5 and 6. As Pat said, 12.2% organic and 18.2% adjusted margins, both pretty close to our September IR Day expectations. And looking forward, we see these excellent results continuing in the fourth quarter. Organic growth -- revenue growth of about 10% and margins in the mid- to upper 18% range. That would be a full year organic growth of about 12% and full year margins around 18.5%. Looking to '23, we will see the roll in of the new large carrier client, and we have already had a nice new business win in Australia that will end up midyear. Add continued strong new business production, combined with continued growth in newer rising claims, we see organic at least in the high single digits and margins around 19% in '23. All right. Let's shift now to the CFO commentary document. Starting with Page 3, which shows our typical brokerage and risk management modeling helpers. A few things to highlight. First, the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar since our September IR Day. Please take a look at our updated FX guidance for the fourth quarter of '22. As for 2023, perhaps the best start is just to assume what we are projecting for full year '22 repeats in '23, but most of that will be seen in the first half. Second, you'll see our current estimate for fourth quarter integration costs, most of all of this relates to the reinsurance acquisition. The team is making really excellent progress on this and is executing at a faster pace than our original plan. It was terrific to see our new reinsurance colleagues located with our other brokerage operations when I was in London a couple of weeks ago. As for technology and system rebuilds, we still see being done by the end of '23 or early '24. Turning to the Corporate segment on Page 4. Relative to our September outlook, interest in banking, clean energy and M&A costs after adjusting for the large transaction-related expenses, those 3 lines totaled to about the midpoint of our outlook. Within the corporate line, most of the upside was due to some favorable tax items and a favorable FX remeasurement gain. Looking towards the fourth quarter, moving down that page, only one significant change to our outlook. As you'll see in the fourth quarter corporate line and read in Footnote 7 on that Page 4, here in October, we settled a litigation resulting in Gallagher receiving $55 million in cash. Net of litigation costs and taxes, we will record a gain of approximately $35 million, and you'll see a few lines down that we'll adjust that gain out of our GAAP results. As for the cash proceeds, which because of our tax credits is actually closer to $40 million, we'll put that to good work over the next couple of years to fund incremental production hires and make incremental investments in technology. I'll break down our thinking a little more during our December IR day.  Moving now to Page 5, Clean Energy. This page should be familiar to everyone by now. It highlights that we have close to $1 billion of tax credit carryforwards. The pinkish column shows that we expect to however, a $125 million to $150 million of cash flows here in '22, and the peach column shows that we could be even greater in '23 and beyond. And as a reminder, that would come through our cash flow statement, not our P&L.  Turning to Page 6. The top of the page is the rollover revenue table. Third quarter revenues of $162 million, that's right in line with our expectations 6 weeks ago. Shifting to the lower half of the page, this table is an update on our December '21 reinsurance acquisition. Third quarter revenue of $120 million is consistent with our September IR day estimate. As for EBITDAC, a tightening difference between third and fourth quarter. Punchline is full year revenue and EBITDAC should come in very close to our pro forma. That's a really terrific story and great credit to the team. Okay. As to cash and capital management and future M&A. At September 30, available cash on hand was about $500 million, and we've been saying that we might have around $4 billion of M&A capacity in '22 and '23 combined without using stock. That still seems about right to us today. Okay. Those are my comments. Another fantastic quarter and 9 months is in the books, another strong outlook for the fourth quarter, and it's looking like we're well positioned for a terrific year in 2023. Back to you, Pat. Well, listen, I think the way we look at it this way, is we're not seeing it in our underlying business today, and we're also viewing if there is a recession in '23. We see that being more like what happened in the early -- in the 1991 period, in the 2000, 2001 period, more of a normal soft landing recession. We do not see a recession next year like the subprime financial shock of '08 and -- '07 and '08 or the pandemic recession that we saw for a few months in '20. Those normal recessions typically last about 2 or 3 quarters. And when we go back to the best we can do to get data back then, we actually performed very well during those light recessions. In this case, I think that next year, if there is -- if anything happens, and we do go into a recession, I think it's going to drive excess demand more than it is to contract supply and we ensure supply. So in our contemplation for next year is a lot like this year, exposure units holding stable, rates going up like we're seeing this year. But I see -- I don't see a lot of change all of a sudden on 1/1 that the world has changed dramatically from what it's been for the last 3 to 6 months, right now. So that's our go-in case. That's how we're preparing our budgets in that range. So that's how we came up with that 7% to 9%. Yes. All right. So yes, in answer to your question, we see reinsurance in that high single-digit range next year. Right now, the best -- remember, you got a lot of treaties that are multi-line. But right now, the best we can tell is pure property is 28%. You put in the package on that, I'd say it might be closer to 40% of the book of business. And then you look at some of our kind of high-risk casualty lines, maybe you've got a book that's -- 60% of it is facing a kind of a tough renewal season. Yes. I think for 2023, and again, I'll give you some more here in December, there will be an upside from investment income. That -- not all of that will hit the bottom line because there could be some incremental inflation that we see in some of our numbers. Remember, about 80% of our business, we don't believe has significant exposure to headline inflation. And like we said last at our IR Day or on an earlier call, about 20% of our expenses, they do have some inflation pressures on it. But in our opinion, there will be clearly an upside to that thinking as a result of incremental investment income next year. But I still need to work through that math over the next couple of months. Our next question is from Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed. You're talking about the '23? Yes. I think that when we look at 6% organic growth with possibly 50 basis points of margin expansion, that does not include a possible upside from incremental investment income, but not all that incremental investment income will likely hit the EBITDA line. It could go to some inflationary pressures on some of our cost base or it could go to some discretionary spend, but it would be upside to that 6 points, 50 basis points outlook. Our outlook on the impact of Ian to our contingent commissions is $465,000 of impact against our revenues. That has all been fully booked in the numbers that you see here today. We do not believe that would develop differently than that. We just are not that -- we're just not exposed to contingent commissions on operating placements in our book of business. Yes, Greg, I will say this. It's been 20 years since I've been CFO of insurance companies, but right now, this is a time where my reinsurance brokers would be the most important people to have in my office with their skills, their capabilities, and this is a time where they really earn their money. I think that it's not linear. If we posted 9%, I don't think you'd have 150 basis points of margin expansion, but you might have 75 to a point, something like that. But I think that -- let us get through this and get through our December, look at our budgets. And some of this is discretionary spending that we might want to make in investing in technologies and other organic growth strategies. But -- yes, I mean, there is a case that, that could happen. Well, listen, if we ended up with excess capital, our first metric would be is to make sure that we maintain a solid investment grade rating borrowing. With interest rates going up, that's more and more important every day. Second of all, I think that our M&A pipeline is still robust. And the third thing is, remember, the arbitrage that we get on the multiples. And -- more importantly, we're building out the team. We bring more people on our side of the field to go out and compete on every day and create more organic afterwards. So for us, buying back stock is certainly what we can do. It's certainly part of the math, and its part of the story. But I'd like to see us doing more and more M&A every day to put our cash to work at multiples that are -- that deliver arbitrage value to our shareholders. So -- we're out there, we're looking very hard. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. But I think we've got a ton of opportunities in our pipeline right now. Well, listen, we've got some pretty good pipelines going on, especially in Canada, Australia and the U.K. right now. So we'd be happy to continue to look at those acquisitions there. And yes, the dollar does have a little bit of an impact on that, but it's not what drives our investment choices. All right. So a couple of things -- you got a couple of things to unpack. But first, let's talk about the increase in the headcount. We have actually substantially increased our head count in our offshore centers of excellence. As you know, we've been talking about it for 15 years now. We think that that's a terrific spot to improve the quality of the offer of our insurance offerings. And as a result, we're ramping up significantly more in offshore right now that can do that work for us. And the -- so we're up considerably in that. So that's what's driving the metric you're seeing is mostly offshore resources there. When it comes to the opportunity -- the drop in the comp ratio this quarter, some of that has to do with bonus timing. If you recall last quarter, I said we were a little ahead on our bonus accruals. So we didn't have to post quite as much this quarter, which probably offset some of the -- well, we did have a little bit of inflation in our rates pool. We gave away another $8 million this year, something like that in that -- in the raise pool this year. What's offsetting that is the timing of the bonus. Well, listen, I think that Ian has brought a different tone in the marketplace. I think you're seeing some reports of reserve strengthening across line. You saw the reinsurance outlook we've talked about -- and remember, the reason why we got to 6% to 9% is we were saying that 23 felt somewhere between 2019 and 2022 and '19 happen to be 6% organic growth. So in the context of the comment in September, relative to 2 different years. And now as we're getting closer on our budget process and really looking at what we're starting to see in the renewal pipeline, we thought we could tighten that range up a little bit. Okay. I'll take that in a couple of different bites. This quarter, let's call it, $12.5 million that we had as additional investment income as a result of rate changes. Then you're asking how much of that fell to the bottom line. Maybe a better way for me to do this is to take a look at what does it mean for full year. If you recall at the beginning of the year, what we said is -- since when we were sitting in January, we looked back and we had said that we had posted about 550 basis points of margin expansion. And when we looked out and that was over 2 years. Then we said, if we look forward, again, I'm standing in January of 2022, we said that we might be able to get margin expansion of 10 to 20 basis points on organic from about 8% here in '22. So what's happened since that expectations. We're still looking at 10 to 20 basis points of margin expansion. But organic is running a point better and, let's say, investment income between this year that might be up, let's say, $30 million more of investment income in the year. So that's about $80 million more of revenues this year. And so the way I look at it is, where did that go? Where did the $80 million of revenue go? Well, first of all, we dropped -- we're going to drop one-third of that to the bottom line. So that leaves $50 million to $53 million of additional revenues. Well, we have to pay our producers field leadership and support that. Usually, that runs about 45% of the revenue on that organic of $50 million, call that $23 million. So now we're down to explain where did $30 million go as a result of incremental organic and incremental investment income, again, relative to our outlook at the beginning of the year. Well, I can tell you that we spent about $10 million on incremental hiring, some incremental raises and some incremental incentive comp this year. Maybe it's one-third. And we also know that we -- about $10 million went to incremental travel and entertainment expense. Now that's mostly due to inflation, and it's not due to increased trips versus our expectation. Again, this is against our expectation at the beginning of the year. And then finally, we spent an extra $10 million on IT betterment projects than probably we would have expected at the beginning of the year because we have the bandwidth in order to implement those projects. So for me, sitting here relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, I think it's a really terrific outcome. And what I'm really proud of is the team has done a great job this year. They have been disciplined in their travel and they've been selected in their value-added efforts that they're bringing to the clients. And they've been pretty wise about other IT investments. And yet to still deliver 10 to 20 basis points of margin expansion this year in an inflationary environment on top of the 550 that we had delivered in the previous two years I think it's a pretty darn good year, in my opinion. So relative to expectation, that's a long-winded answer -- but I think it gives you a perspective on incremental investment income and incremental organic relative to where we were sitting at the beginning of the year. And remember, we still -- at the beginning of the year, we had the Omicron crisis going on, and we were still in the depths of the pandemic. So we still have done our way out of those pandemic expenses returning along the way. So a long story, long answer, but I hope it gets you to where you need to go. Yes. I think it's a little bit of a -- I wouldn't say it's a symmetrical bell curve, but around 8% -- I thought -- 6% to 10% on that. So maybe it's 2 points on either side of it, and that probably favors the bull case on that more than the bare case on it. Yes. I would say, listen, if we get into a recession that you wanted to refer to as you being a downer on, that type of recession, we're still in an inflating rate environment, and we're not seeing a slowdown on that. When it comes to the contraction of exposure units, I'm not seeing trucks just come out of the fleet. They may not be running quite as much, and I know there's a mileage adjustment on it, but I'm not completely convinced that the stuff that we insure will just all of a sudden evaporate next year. Might have to -- they may take different covers on it. They may take some additional deductibles. When you're also looking at an environment, if you get into a recession, that will help us on our employee retention because they will stay with a good company, versus jumping for a new opportunity. So when those 3 or 4 things applied, rate increases, stable workforce a flight to quality and what people are looking for in terms of their broker, I see us performing very well in that environment. If you want me to pick a number in there, if we have a downer I'd be hard pressed to see how it would be less than 5% organic growth. Yes, we kind of signaled that early on. Their appetite is still strong right now. But when you're adding an extra 300 basis points of debt cost into the structure does change return expectations. And I think that we're really not competing on price when we come to these deals, Josh, we're really competing on capabilities. And we win on every day. If somebody decides our prices aren't dissimilar to what they're offering. That maybe be a turn higher, but people just have chosen that they don't want to be in an organization with increased capabilities or resources. So this will cause a compression of pricing by the PEs, it will probably come down to where we're comfortable with pain. And I think we should excel in that then because now it isn't about price. It's entirely about capabilities. Yes. Go ahead, Ryan. Yes. I think you've got your notes right in it. And I think if you go back and you listen to our IR Days, these earnings calls, we get an hour to talk to you, but during our IR Days, you hear our 5 or 6 division leaders talk about all the investments you listen to the first 5 minutes or 6 minutes of their prepared remarks. They're talking about all the value-added features and client-centric enhancements that we're doing in our business. And we're spending a lot of money on that. We've talked about Gallagher Drive. We've talked about SmartMarket, we've talked about Gallagher Submit. We've talked about our niche resources. If you look at our content that's out there, all of that is investment and we're adding to it every year.

On the call for today is Doug Howell, our CFO; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. Before I get to my comments about our financial results, I'd like to acknowledge the damage of devastation caused by Hurricane Ian. Our professionals are working diligently to help our clients sort through their coverages, file claims and ultimately get losses paid. At the same time, many of our own colleagues are doing the same for themselves. Our hearts go out to all of those impacted by the storm. In the aftermath of events such as in the insurance industry's role and response is paramount to help families, businesses and communities restore their lives. I'm really honored to be part of an industry with such important responsibility. Okay, on to my comments regarding our third quarter financial performance. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 15% growth in revenue, 8.4% organic growth, net earnings growth of 12%, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 15%, and we completed or signed 7 mergers in the quarter totaling about $60 million of annualized revenues. Another fantastic quarter by our team. Let me give you some more detail on our third quarter performance, starting with our Brokerage segment. During the quarter, reported revenue growth was 16%. Of that, 7.8% was organic. That's right in line with our September IR Day expectation when we previewed there would be about a full point of headwind related to timing from a tough '21 comparison within our benefits business. Acquisition rollover revenues were $162 million. Net earnings growth was 11%, and we posted adjusted EBITDAC margins of 32.3%, a bit better than our IR Day guidance. Another excellent quarter for our brokerage team. Focusing on brokerage segment organic, it continues to be broad-based by both business and geography. Let me walk you around the world and provide some more detailed commentary, starting with our P/C operations. Our U.S. retail business posted 9% organic with strong new business and solid client retention, both consistent with last year's third quarter. Risk Placement Services, our U.S. wholesale operations, also posted organic of 9%. This includes more than 20% organic in open brokerage and about 5% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business was strong at more than 27% of prior year revenue, and retention was consistent with last year's third quarter. Shifting outside the U.S. Our U.K. businesses posted organic of 15% with excellent new business production and retention. Australia and New Zealand combined organic was 9%. New business production remained very strong and retention improved relative to last year's third quarter. Canada was up 13% organically and continues to benefit from renewal premium increases, robust new business and consistent retention. Moving to our Employee Benefit Brokerage and Consulting business. As I mentioned earlier, as we signaled last quarter and again at our September IR Day, our benefits business faced a tough organic comparison this quarter. Recall that due to last year's upward development in covered lives as employers resumed hiring coming out of the depths of the pandemic. Leveling for that, our benefits business organic was about 3%. And that's consistent with our IR Day expectations and includes strong growth with our HR benefits consulting units and solid growth in our international businesses. And before I conclude my organic comments, let me give you a quick update on our December 21 reinsurance acquisition. Third quarter revenues were right in line with our expectations and while not included in our Brokerage segment organic yet after controlling for breakage prior to closing, organic was around 8%. That's just outstanding. With expected revenues and EBITDAC for full year unchanged, reinsurance continues to be a fantastic story. So headline Brokerage segment all in organic of 7.8% and around 9% after controlling for the benefits comparison either way, an outstanding organic quarter. Next, let me give you some thoughts on our current PC market environment, starting in the primary insurance market. Overall, global third quarter renewal premiums, that's both rate and exposure combined, were up 10.5%. That's a bit higher than renewal premium change in the first half of '22. As for rate, most lines of business and geographies saw increases in third quarter, similar to the first half with only one exception being D&O, where rates are now closer to flat, but our customers are buying more limits. Additionally, our customers' third quarter business activity was not reflective of any economic slowdown. In fact, revenue related to third quarter midterm policy endorsements, audits and cancellations combined were above third quarter '21 levels. Looking ahead, thus far in October, midterm policy endorsements and audit adjustments remain higher than last year's level, and renewal premium increases are also consistent with the third quarter. But remember, our job is to help our clients mitigate that overall 10% increase in premiums by developing creative risk management solutions that fit their budgets. Let me move to the reinsurance market. Let me provide you with some broad observations regarding the upcoming '23 and reinsurance renewal season. First, there is no question that rates, terms and conditions will vary depending on geography, individual seed and loss history, risk characteristics and line of business. Second, pricing on peak zone property catastrophe cover is moving higher. And tightening terms and conditions are highly likely. Third, while we haven't witnessed the impact of Hurricane Ian spill over to non-property lines yet, it is possible that, that could happen if there's a broad shift in reinsurance risk appetite and capacity deployment strategies. Fourth and finally, the amount of property reinsurance capacity available is an open question. Some reinsurance providers had already planned to pull back their cat capacity priority in. And now it is likely the significant level of ILS capital to be trapped into 1/1 renewals, further pressuring potential capacity. Ultimately, supply will depend on expected returns from changes in pricing, terms and conditions and perhaps expected returns will reach a level that will attract additional reinsurance capital. While we have yet to see any significant third-party capital into the market, given ILS capital can move quickly, there is still time before the January renewal season. This will play out over the next 2 months. But at this point, it seems the stage is set for a hard or even harder renewals market as we enter the important 1/1 renewal season. Reinsurance conditions will no doubt influence primary markets in 2023 and carriers we're already facing rising loss costs in property and casualty lines. We see good reason for our carrier partners to continue to underwrite retail and wholesale risks cautiously for the foreseeable future. Moving to our Employee Benefit Brokerage and Consulting business. U.S. labor market conditions remained tight, but broadly favorable. During August, while U.S. employers reduced job openings by 1 million positions, there are still more than 10 million job openings according to the most recent data. And the level of open jobs remains well above the nearly 6 million people unemployed in looking for work as of the end of September. So we see tight U.S. labor market conditions lingering for some time and expect strong demand for our HR and benefits consulting services to continue as businesses prioritize, attracting, retaining and motivating their workforce. Let me wrap up my Brokerage segment organic comments with 3 terrific quarters in the books. Year-to-date, brokerage organic growth stands at 9.3%. And as I look to the fourth quarter, I see us posting another quarter above 9% that would deliver a fantastic year. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. During the third quarter, we completed 6 new tuck-in brokerage mergers representing about $20 million of estimated annualized revenues. We also signed another merger late in the third quarter, representing an additional $40 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have about 50 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing nearly $400 million of annualized revenue. We know not all of these will close, however, we believe we'll get our fair share. Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic growth was 12.2%, a strong finish to the quarter, pushed organic a bit higher than our IR day expectation. We also continue to benefit from increases in new arising claims across general liability and core workers' compensation during the quarter. That's both on an organic existing client basis and also due to some recent new client wins, including the significant insurance company client we added to our fast-growing insurance carrier practice. And profitability remains excellent. Third quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was 18.2%, in line with our expectations. That would have been closer to 19% without the impact from the new large client ramp-up that we spoke about at our September IR meeting. Looking forward for the fourth quarter, we believe organic revenue growth will be about 10% and adjusted EBITDAC margins between 18.5% and 19% that would close out a great year for the Gallagher Bassett team. And I'll conclude my remarks with some thoughts on our bedrock culture. October 2 marked Gallagher's 95th anniversary. I took note on that day that our teams were hard at work helping our clients assess damage, file claims and ultimately start the repairing and the building process for Ian. And if not directly assisting individuals and communities impacted many Gallagher colleagues around the world donated their own money to help those impacted by Ian. What a fitting way for us to solidly celebrate this incredible milestone. My grandfather would be proud of the company founded to employees that embody the culture he started in the industry in which we toll. It's our people's actions and challenging times that bring our unique Gallagher culture to the forefront, a culture that we believe will thrive for another 95 years.  Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thanks, Doug. Operator, if you would, let's open it up for questions, please. Weston, let me take the recession question. Doug, can take a look at the numbers across -- I think we did a pretty good job of laying out those numbers by division a moment ago. And I think we said we thought they're pretty consistent next year. So I think you look at our prepared remarks, you got that question answered. But the recession one is an interesting one because one of the reasons in our prepared remarks, we talk about what's going on with endorsements is we can daily look at that information to see what's going on in the underlying business of our clients. We can also look at renewal exposure units as they're being put through to the market for renewal. And as you know, when you renew a client, you have to estimate sales and payrolls going forward. So clients are pretty smart. I'm not wanting to basically overpay and then wait for a return of that premium in an audit, 18 months or 15 months after the close of the year. So it's a bit of a yin and yang between the broker, the underwriter and the client as we look at what are those payrolls that we should be providing. We're not seeing a big decrease in sales and payrolls. Renewals are going out the door with perception of their business being okay. And that's verified by the midterm audits and endorsements that we're seeing. So -- I read the Wall Street Journal every day. I read the left-hand column yesterday, the world just came to end, I didn't know it. But we'll give you more of a reflection on that in December. No, it's still very, very competitive. And there's a lot of interest out there in our industry still, we're watching that very carefully to see if some of that falls off. You'll see some write-ups recently about the number of deals done coming down a bit. I don't know if that's an early sign that maybe some of the people want to sit on the sideline a bit. But for the deals that we're after right now, the competition is very strong. I hope they do, but we're not yet. No, I don't think so, Greg. I think it's clear that we earned our money. And that's -- you see that in the market. I mean, it's -- the business has been very stable, I've had a chance to meet with a number of managements. They know exactly every dollar that we're making. There is no hidden factor here anywhere. And we have to do the work that justifies that income level every single day. Now in my experience as a retailer, I'm not a reinsurance person, but a hard market makes you incredibly more valuable. In a soft market in the retail business, some person with a shingle out to get a quote and beat you, when you're sitting with someone in a hard market, you are talking strategy, man. You are not talking about what's going to happen to my comp premium. You're talking about, am I going to get GL cover. And that's going right down to personal lines. I've got tons of friends, as you can imagine, in South Florida. Am I going to get homeowners next year? I don't know. I mean, I think you will, but you're going to pay more and they know it. Now that, I think, trusted adviser works its way all the way back to reinsurance, and this is not a time when these carriers are going to put a lot of emphasis on how much we get paid when they're looking at trying to get returns literally on hundreds of millions of dollars of ratings. Well, I mean -- first of all, Greg, as you know, when prices are going up, one of the skills that brought us to the point we are today is the capability of taking people who are -- should be self-insuring into that market. and showing them how to take higher retentions and bringing Gallagher Bassett in. Recessionary work has the same -- now I'm talking about the larger upper middle market. The recession has the same kind of impact, especially if you get a recession, while at the same time, pricing has gone up. They're looking for alternatives. And when I say your alternative is to pay tomorrow instead of today and to really manage your claims hard and work it hard at preventing them, there's a lot better listeners than when the prices are dropping, and that's going right to their bottom line and their private companies and they're happy as a clam. When you get to the larger accounts, these are very sophisticated buyers. And they don't move around based on recessions. Now if there is a recession and our larger clients have a lesser population, they close down shifts, then you'll see claim counts drop. But I don't think you're going to see an impact on that business that happens in the short term, and we'll know well in advance of any kind of a downturn as people start slowing their business down and cutting shifts, we'll be well aware of it. We can probably comment better as we go into the new quarters. We're just not seeing that right now, Greg. I think that's the interesting thing to me. As I said, I read the journal every day, and I'm sitting there and go, okay. And then we test and test and test, and our primary business partners are doing really well. Then we looked at the GB results and claim counts are up. They're not down. So it's -- I get why you're questioning it. I really do get the conundrum. But here's the thing. Doug pointed out that the other recessions we've done well. Clients do not jump in and out of self-insurance. You make that decision to move to taking a big retention and paying your claims. You may have a -- you may see your claim counts go down because hours worked are less, but you're not jumping in on the market. It's a pretty good place to be. Thanks, Greg. Well, from your lips to god's ears, Elyse. If you take a look back at our results in other hard markets, yes, that could happen. I mean, I'm not going to sit here and say no. If capacity dries up, smaller brokers in those environments can't get the job done, reinsurance clearly is -- and look at cap trapital in the ILS market, depending on whether capacity is there or whether capacity comes in, yes, I think you could see a variable -- you could write a bullish story. Also, Yaron, I think that before in, it was clear that loss cost and verdicts and what have you, we're putting pressure on our carriers. Today, we look across the loss on the cat level and wonder if they're not going to bleed into the casualty lines. And I've had some conversations with some of our reinsurance pros, we think that that's a very good possibility. If that happens, that will be -- that will benefit from that as well. Primarily in the retail market, as accounts go from being, say, upper middle, middle market, where typically, you'll have about 85% to 90% of your clients, probably, we're 100% transparent. This is their choice. We have an adult conversation. They know we collect contingents. Let's not go back to 2004 and get me all in trouble, again, for accepting convenience and supplemental. They're all disclosed. This is client choice. And so as they get a little bigger, if they bring in a risk manager, that type of thing, then there's usually a shift to fee and we're happy with that. You're dealing with the most sophisticated buyers in the market. And as Doug just said a bit ago, when he was buying reinsurance, he wasn't messing around worrying about what the guy or gal is getting paid. The point is, this is talking at the essence of their capital, the returns, how they're going to balance out the demand, you've got a supply and demand imbalance. It's looking like it's coming down the path at being very substantial. They want to be good players. They want to take advantage of it. They want to make sure that they get good returns. And so it's good returns that ultimately hopefully bring in more capacity. But these buyers are very sophisticated. They'll pay us more money. I mean, the question earlier on was are they going to keep paying us what they're used to paying us. And they'll pay us more money, but it's not -- this is not a linear progression. I get down to the bad policies and into the lower middle market, it's linear. Price is up 10%. We're going to help the client reduce that by moving deductibles around, dropping umbrella limits, et cetera. But by and large, policy by policy, we're going to get that commission. That's not the case in reinsurance. I think Doug did a very good job, sure he did, of taking it back in time. I mean, go back and take -- our results are public going back to '84. I think we do extremely well in good times and bad times. Certainly, recessions are not good for brokers. Sales and payrolls are what drive our premiums. So there's no question that if sales and payrolls go down, we'll feel the impact of that. Having said that, people get more interested in listening to us talking to them about how our professionalism, our capabilities in our niches and what have you, you can help them deal with this, the local brokers who takes the hit. The E&S market is on fire. And I think you're seeing more premiums move there, freedom of rate, freedom of form, clients need, cover everything from small accounts to large accounts. That's why we're seeing so much interest in terms of people investing in that market. That -- the primary markets, quite honestly, are not as flexible as the E&S markets are able to move at the pace that they can move, and they are in a tough market sucking business out of the primaries. Did that answer your question, Rob? Let me caution because I've been a retailer in my whole life. But for the last year, I've had a chance to spend a good bit of time with our reinsurance folks and do anything I can to learn that business and I talked about this at length in the last quarter. And it has happened in the past. I can't give you dates, times and amounts or percent.  But -- yes, when you have a capital situation where you need to increase the pricing and you can add cat loads on other lines of coverage, you'll do that when you have to -- now again, I can't say to you that this is exactly what travelers or hyper did in this year given this situation or what have you. I can't take you back to Andrew or something like that or even Katrina.  But what the team is telling me is that it's very likely, given the dearth of our capacity and the need -- because of the supply and demand imbalance, the need for more rate, that their other lines are selling that are likely to take in advance as well. And sorry that I'm not more specific about that. I'm learning along with you. No. And that's the thing that's -- I keep referring to the Wall Street Journal, sorry, but I mean I read it and I sit there and I go, okay, and then I come back and I talk to our data people and they're like, no, I'm not seeing it. I can't also can't break it and say, well, construction is in the tank and retail is going through the roof or trucking is really hurting now and something -- so -- and we've checked things like our marine business. What's happening with cargo, cargo seems to be holding up and if there's any decrease in cargo, then cruise ships are, I mean, going through the roof. So it's kind of a -- it's a weird time based on what we read and what we see in our -- and these are not anecdotal stores. These are higher data points that I've got, and I can get them every day. And broad geographic, solid, continued business growth is what we're seeing. You fall off a cliff? I guess. We're just not seeing it. Well, dream with me a little here, Josh. I mean, yes, I think what Doug meant is that our price is similar to our competitors. Yes, multiples over the last five years have expanded substantially. Prices are higher for these deals. But money was free. So now you start paying for that money, and I'm not hoping for a recession, and we don't see one, but show a little slowdown in there. And maybe that annuity isn't as strong as it was before. Our lever is about 2.3 times EBITDA. We've got competitors in the market that are happy to be at 9 times. I'm sorry, at some point, the music has got to stop and all the chairs aren't going to be full. Yes, I'd agree with that. The returns have been outstanding. I agree with that. So to add to that, I would say take a look at our internship, we're very proud of the fact that this summer, we had 500 young people look at our business. And these are paid interns. These aren't interns that come to work for free, and that's a U.S.-based number. If we take the people outside the U.S., it's probably closer to 600. I don't know another organization investing in the future of their people like that in our business or, frankly, another business. So I'm very proud of that. Thanks, Ryan, and thank you, everybody, for joining us. We really appreciate this evening. We had an excellent third quarter. We're well on our way to delivering a fantastic year of financial performance. I need to thank more than 42,000 colleagues around the globe for their hard work and dedication to our clients. We look forward to speaking with you again in person in December at our Investment Day in New York. Thanks again, everybody. Have a great evening."

It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had another excellent quarter of financial performance. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 22% growth in revenue, 10.7% organic growth, net earnings growth of 35%, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 23% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 19%. I'm extremely proud of how our nearly 41,000 colleagues around the globe performed during the quarter in the first half of the year. So let me give you some more detail on our second quarter Brokerage segment performance. During the quarter, reported revenue growth was 25%. Of that, 10.8% was organic. We did have a tailwind of about 1 point from an infrequent large life case that I'll touch on in a minute. Rollover revenues were about $240 million, consistent with our June IR Day expectations. Net earnings growth was 36%. And as expected, we posted adjusted EBITDAC margins of 32%, an outstanding quarter for the Brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and break down our organic, starting with our PC operations. Our U.S. retail business posted 11% organic, with strong new business, retention and continued renewal premium increases. Risk Placement Services, our U.S. wholesale operations, posted organic of 8%. This includes more than 15% organic in open brokerage and 4% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business was consistent with second quarter of '21, while retention was down just a bit from last year, as we noted in our June IR Day. Shifting outside the U.S. Our U.K. businesses posted organic of 8% with excellent new business overall and another double-digit organic growth quarter within specialty. Australia and New Zealand combined organic was more than 11%, driven by strong new business, stable retention and higher renewal premium increases. Canada was up more than 14% organically and continues to benefit from renewal premium increases, great new business and great retention. Moving to our Employee Benefits Brokerage and Consulting business. As I mentioned earlier, we were helped this quarter from a large life case. Excluding this, our benefits business organic was about 9%, in line with our IR Day expectations and driven by increased HR benefits consulting work and solid growth in our International and Health and Welfare businesses. Finally, our December reinsurance acquisition is right on target. After controlling for breakage prior to closing, second quarter organic was around 7%, just fantastic, and integration continues to progress nicely on budget and ahead of its original time line. So reinsurance continues to be a really good story. So headline Brokerage segment all in organic of 10.8% and upper 9% after controlling for the large life case, either way, an excellent quarter. Next, let me give you some thoughts on the current PC market environment, starting in the primary insurance market. Overall, global second quarter renewal premiums, that's both rate and exposure combined, were up 10.5%. That's higher than what our data showed for increases in renewal premiums in both the fourth quarter '21 and first quarter '22. When I look at our renewal premiums by line for nearly all coverages, second quarter increases were equal to or higher than first quarter. One exception to this was professional liability, mostly D&O. By geography, renewal premiums were up double digits, nearly everywhere. Again, that's a combination of both rate and exposure. So next to no slowdown in premium increases during the quarter. Additionally, we are not seeing any significant signs of economic slowdown. In fact, second quarter midterm policy endorsements, audits and cancellations continue to trend more favorable than a year ago. Thus far in July, midterm policy endorsements continue to move higher year-over-year, and renewal premium increases are consistent with second quarter. But remember, our job as brokers is to help our clients mitigate premium increases and find suitable insurance programs that fit their budgets. Moving to reinsurance. As we noted in our first view report published by our reinsurance professionals earlier this month, there are very real signs of hardening in the reinsurance market. Property reinsurance pricing is up across the board. And most notably, for U.S. hurricane and Australian property risks are up anywhere from 15% to more than 40%. On the casualty side, reinsurance placements experienced more modest price increases and were a little bit less challenging. Regardless, a firm or hardening reinsurance market will naturally show up in primary market rate increases. And there are many other reasons for our carrier partners to maintain their cautious underwriting stance outside of reinsurance market conditions, inflation, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty to name a few. These all translate into a difficult PC market conditions continuing for our clients across retail, wholesale and reinsurance for this foreseeable future. Moving to our Employee Benefit Brokerage and Consulting business, U.S. labor market conditions remained broadly favorable. Even with a decline in U.S. job postings in each of the last 2 months, there remain more than 11 million job openings, that's more than double the number of people unemployed and looking for work. We expect strong demand for our HR and benefits consulting services to continue as businesses prioritize attracting, retaining and motivating their workforce. The timing of the large life case and covered live changes in the second half of '21 will cause the Benefits business to post lumpy quarterly organic results this year, but that doesn't change the still favorable underlying environment. So let me wrap up on the Brokerage segment organic. A great first half and looking like the second half will lead us to a full year '22 organic over 9%, which would be an absolutely terrific year. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed 8 new tuck-in brokerage mergers representing about $50 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing nearly $350 million of annualized revenue. We know not all of these will close, however, we believe we will get our fair share. Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Second quarter organic growth was 10.3%, a bit better than our IR Day expectation due to a strong June. Adjusted EBITDAC margin was 18.9%, which is in line with our expectations. For the year, we continue to see adjusted EBITDAC margins near that 19% level. We again saw increases in new arising claims across general liability, property and core workers' compensation during the quarter. Encouragingly, property and liability claim counts are back to prepandemic levels. Core workers' comp claim counts have yet to fully rebound to 2019 levels, which represents a nice opportunity for further growth. Looking towards the second half of the year, we think organic revenue growth will continue to push 10% due to growing claim counts and new business. I'll conclude my remarks with some thoughts on our bedrock culture. As I resume traveling to our Gallagher offices around the globe, I can report to you that our culture is as strong as ever, and that's a reflection of our people, our nearly 41,000 colleagues working together for a common goal to serve our clients. As I've said before, our people underpin our culture, a culture that we believe is a true competitive advantage and drives our outstanding financial results. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone, an excellent second quarter and terrific count. Today, I'll touch on organic margins and the Corporate segment using our earnings release and then make some comments using our CFO commentary document posted on our website. I'll end then with my typical comments on M&A, debt and cash. Okay, starting with the earnings release to the Brokerage segment organic table on Page 3. Fantastic headline all-in brokerage organic of 10.8%. As Pat said, we did benefit by about 1 point or so because of a large group live case found in late June. With or without that, a great quarter by our sales team. As for the rest of '22, during our June IR Day, we said third and fourth quarter would be somewhere around 8% due to a tough benefits compare. As we sit today, we're still seeing third quarter around that 8%, reflecting about 1 point of that tough benefits compare, and we're becoming more bullish in fourth quarter, call it nicely over 8% in the fourth quarter. That would lead to full year Brokerage segment organic growth of over 9%. So today, we're forecasting full year organic growth better than what we were seeing at our June IR Day. Next, turning to Page 5 to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Headline all-in adjusted EBITDAC margin of 32%, right in line with our June IR day expectation. Recall what we've been saying all year, because of the roll-in impact of the acquired reinsurance operations, which has substantial quarterly seasonality and because there are still expenses returning as we come out of the pandemic, those in combination create quarterly margin change volatility. As a recap, we posted adjusted margins up 50 basis points in the first quarter, down 97 basis points here in the second, and we're forecasting down 100 basis points in the third, then back up 100 basis points in the fourth. Because we are seasonally the largest in the first quarter, those results would roll-up to around 10 to 20 basis points of full year margin expansion. These quarterly margin changes are right on what we've been saying all year. When I think of the inflation impact, I just don't see much here in '22 on our expenses. And as we discussed in June, headline inflation doesn't significantly impact 80% of our expense base. And we have mitigation levers to pull on that other 20% if it comes to that. So even with rising CPI, we remain comfortable with our 2020 margin outlook. Looking towards '23, all that quarter margin change volatility should go away with the pandemic behind us and reinsurance fully rolled into our books. Moving to the Risk Management segment on Pages 5 and 6, Pat hit the highlights. 10.3% organic and 18.9% adjusted margins, an excellent quarter. This unit continues to show momentum with rebounding claim counts and a large new business win coming on next quarter. It's looking now like organic revenue growth of around 10% in each of third and fourth quarters '22. Now remember, that's on top of 17% growth in third quarter '21 and 13% growth in fourth quarter '21, that would be a terrific outcome to overcome such a difficult compare. Moving to Page 7 of the earnings release to the Corporate segment shortcut table. Interest in banking is within our June IR Day range. Adjusted M&A costs in clean energy, they combined -- those combined also within our range. And Corporate, after adjusting for some favorable tax item, is slightly better than our June IR Day range, call it about $0.01 due to favorable FX remeasurement gains given the strengthening in the dollar. Let's leave the earnings release and go to the CFO commentary document. On Page 3, these are our typical Brokerage and Risk Management modeling helpers. With the rally in the U.S. dollar since our June IR Day, please take a look at our updated FX guidance for the remainder of '22. This late June strengthening also caused an extra $0.01 headwind here in the second quarter versus our IR Day guidance. Next, you'll see our current estimate of integration costs. Most of this is related to Willis Re. The punchline has no change to our original estimate of $250 million for integration charges through the end of 2024. As I mentioned last quarter, the team is making excellent progress and is executing at a faster pace than our original plan. Integration efforts around people, real estate, back-office transition services are targeted to be mostly done by late '22. In fact, our new reinsurance colleagues are now moving into our combined Gallagher locations around the world, and there's an excitement that is coming together. As for technology and system rebuild, we still see having that done by the end of '23 or early '24. So continued good news on the reinsurance integration front. Next, please take a look at the amortization of intangibles line. Recall we now adjust out our -- that out of our non-GAAP results. Also take a look at footnote number 2. That will help you reconcile this number to what we're showing in the face of our GAAP financial statements. Next to the change in estimated earn-out payable. This quarter, some component of the earn-out payable adjustment has become more pronounced. The punchline is found in footnote number 5. The note admittedly is a little account needs, but it's saying that the large noncash gain in our results this quarter is mostly due to increases in interest rates and market volatility. When these increase, the value of our earn-out liability declines, thus creating GAAP income. This gain does not reflect any meaningful change to our expectations of the acquired brokerages nor does it change our view of what we'll ultimately pay an earn-out. The accounting is a bit like the change in interest rate assumptions and pension accounting, except this change in earn-out liability goes to the P&L, not through OCI as does pensions. In our view, this is a no never mind but can dramatically impact comparability, so we adjusted out. Turning now to Page 4, our Corporate segment outlook. No changes in the third and fourth quarter estimates. Flipping to Page 5, Clean Energy. This page is here to highlight that we have around $1 billion of tax credit carryovers. And with the Sunset program late last year, we're now in the cash harvesting year of these investments. You'll see in the pinkish column that the 2022 cash flow increase should be $125 million to $150 million and perhaps more in '23 and beyond. At this rate, these investments will be a really nice 7-year cash flow sweetener. The possibility of an extension of the loss still exists, so we have idled our plans rather than decommissioning them, cost us a little to carry them, but it lets us remain well positioned to restart production if an extension happens. Turning to Page 6. The top of the page is the rollover revenue table that we've spoken about in detail. We appreciate all those that have incorporated this disclosure into their models. Moving down the page. The bottom table is an update on our December reinsurance acquisition. You'll see that these numbers are almost spot on to our June IR Day estimates. Delivering $730 million of revenue and nearly $260 million of adjusted EBITDAC here in '22 would be very close to our pro formas when we inked the deal. That would be a really good outcome. Moving on to cash and capital management and future M&A. At June 30, available cash on hand was about $450 million. Our operations continue to perform very well, and we expect strong operating cash flows. Add to that, the cash flow sweetener from our Clean Energy investments and additional borrowing capacity, it adds up to more than $4 billion of tuck-in M&A capacity here in '22 and '23 combined. So those are my comments. An excellent quarter and first half, and we're extremely well positioned for another terrific year. Back to you, Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Doug. Daryl, I think we're ready to open it up to questions.\nOperator:  Our first questions come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, Pat, in June, I had asked you about recession. You said you guys were not seeing it. And if you were going to see an impact on your business, it wouldn't be in your results until 2023. So I recognize, right, that we're sitting here 6 months in advance of hitting next year. But as you think about how things can play out from an economic slowdown, we have inflation, still good property casualty pricing, how could that all shake out from an organic growth perspective next year to say if you see things today?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I think it's not all that different than the discussion that we had in June. We're seeing -- literally, we look at this daily, an interesting pattern of our underlying clients' business is doing well. They're still recruiting people. Our benefits HR folks are as busy as they can possibly be. We watch for adjustments, both in terms of audits and endorsements, and those are all positive right now. To put that in perspective, we have -- we do have a baseline on that during the pandemic, and it was -- that was obviously substantially upside down. So we do have a good feel for that, and we feel good about it. Inflation, as Doug said, really has an impact on about 20% of our expenses. I think that's probably good research on the team's part in terms of what's really subject to that, that we'll be watching. As you know, we're going into budget time in the next 6 weeks or so, and there's a lot of discussion around this. So don't hold me to it, but I think that we're pretty -- in a pretty good spot. And I think our mix of business bodes well. I think that the -- the way our expenses shake out, an awful lot of those expenses are variable, I think that's good. A lot of upside for our salespeople this year, obviously. And I think that with rate increases, with interest rates up, it's a pretty good environment for a broker.\nDoug Howell: So let me pile on that a little bit because we don't want whiteboarding on that. Like that, we're not seeing daily indications of our customers' growth slowing at this point. And admittedly, that's looking at current and recent past activity. And I think your question is really more about a future slowdown. So when we looked at that, what kind of cooling might we see, whether it's a recession or just a slowdown in the economy because, obviously, not every recession is the same, we do a lot of work on that. And we see -- if it happens, when I say if, more like a normal recession, maybe more like 1990, '91, and again, of what happened maybe in 2000, 2001, and before 9/11. We do not see next year being a clinch like the subprime financial shock recession of '07 or '08 or the pandemic recession for a few months of '20. So it's also important to note that these more normal recessions in the early '90s and early 2000s, both lasted about 8 months. So we see it more like that. It's also -- it's an important point to remember that brokers -- we are in a very large portion of our revenues based on the amount of premium placed. If it goes up because of rate or because of exposure, frankly, we're a little bit different on that. So for us, we think that like taking a look at nominal GDP is the bigger factor for our revenue much more than real GDP. So absolute sales, payroll, like Pat said, and property values are what premiums are placed on. So when you say, what thoughts next year what will premium rate increases do? And you heard us say that we don't see them slowing over the next year or so. And then really, our spread between new business and loss, we're proficient broker. So selling more insurance than we lose every year. So when we put all that together for next year, the brokerage business during a normal recession during an inflating premium rate environment can still post terrific organic results. So that's how we're seeing it now. And I talked to you about on the expense side during June that we think that we have some mitigating factors for that 20% that might be highly exposed to the inflation component of that. So it's a long answer to your question between Pat and I on it, but we think '23 could still be a year of terrific organic growth.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: But let me load in another thought to, Elyse, we didn't talk about June. But if you go back to 2007, 2008, you go back to the pandemic clinches, we were -- we learned again, which we have through many tough times that our clients will stop paying their people before they stop paying their premiums. And that's a pretty good business to be in regardless of the economy.\nElyse Greenspan: My second question is maybe more short term. Doug, you said the fourth quarter brokerage outlook is a little bit better, right, than at the June IR Day. What's the reason for that?\nDoug Howell: I just think sustained rate increases, and our teams are doing a great job of selling more than we're losing. So I think that just the environment seems to be better. We're starting to see data come out of what's happening with second quarter rates versus first. And there might have been just a little bit of rate drop in the first quarter, and that seems to be back on a positive slope now. So you see that kind of in first quarters when you go back over the last few years that maybe rate increases aren't quite as big as they are in later quarters because you get -- for the carriers, they get the full year of the premium in the books by being maybe a little bit more competitive in the first quarter. Second quarter bounced back up again. I think that we've had a chance to look at what's in our pipeline. So I would say it's on all fronts, we're just feeling more optimistic about where we're seeing the second half.\nElyse Greenspan: And then one last one. You guys gave the M&A color, so it seems like you still have a good pipeline. Have you -- do you think there could be any timing shift in when deals get closed, if people are concerned about a recession? I mean if they're just potentially waiting to get a better multiple or have you not observed that in the past or do you not expect that to happen this time around?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No. I think brokers are opportunistic, smart people. If I had a business to sell, now is when I'd sell it.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: And congrats on a good quarter. First question, the large life case that you mentioned, what's the margin profile on that? Is that accretive or dilutive to the overall Brokerage business?\nDoug Howell: It's about the same. So it doesn't have the leverage as you would see in some of the other incremental amount.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then was FX -- did that have an impact on margins or only on revenues?\nDoug Howell: We adjust that out of our margin profile. So it would be just on the revenue side.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then another one. I know you said you're still -- you haven't fully closed the books on clean coal, holding on hope that maybe you do see some extension come through in D.C. I guess, with the Democrats kind of coming to agreement in the Senate this week or actually today, I think, is it so premature to say what you've learned from that? Or if there is maybe an increasing chance of that clean coal credit continuing or extending?\nDoug Howell: Well, it's a 742 page draft bill that we're doing a lot of word searches on it. I'm not seeing how it's in that, but if you get into the kind of vote-a-rama in the Senate next week to see what other senators might want to include in the package or look at it, I think that -- we're never out of it until -- we're not. And even if it doesn't come through in this package, it could be later in the year or 2. So it doesn't cost us that much to carry the plant. Our utility partners have been very understanding about this. They're not pressing us to decommission. So if you -- that we have to carry it for another 6 months, we will. But if it happens, it would be great. If not, we're in the cash harvesting era just like we thought about for the last 15 years, we're at that point now. So harvesting the cash is pretty nice.\nOperator: Our next question is come from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore.\nDavid Motemaden: I appreciate all the detail just on the midterm policy endorsements, audits. And I guess I'm wondering just on the Employee Benefits business, maybe you could talk about what you're seeing there on HR consulting and benefits consulting specifically with the pipeline? Any changes there? Any signs of weakness at all that you're seeing?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I'll tell you. It's really interesting to see. As you can imagine, I think we talked about this when the pandemic hit, that business shutdown in a quarter. And now -- and what an interesting turnaround for our clients. Now their biggest problem is attracting and retaining. So there is this demand, frankly, at a level that exceeds what we saw prepandemic. And I think in that case, things were kind of going along well. Everything was kind of fine. And then everyone tried to come down to the lowest amount of employee base they could. Now they're coming back. Their businesses are back. As we said, when we looked at our adjustments and endorsements and audits, our clients' businesses so far are robust, and that's a demand -- that creates a demand for more people. So I mean I can't get specific with you by exactly which practice group. It's the entire consulting part of our employee, human resource and human capital business is doing extremely well this year.\nDoug Howell: Yes. Let me add to that. There's -- during the pandemic, people were all about cost containment. And so they cut down their cost and they were cut any discretionary costs. It's regardless of what happens with this recession. And all the Fed actions, I think -- I don't -- I just don't believe that it's going to have a dramatic impact on unemployment. So I think that employers are really thinking about attracting, retaining and motivating their talent. So I just don't see any type of 8 months or yearlong recession putting a dent in the employment numbers. So employers are still going to have to make sure they're out there competing for talent, and that's where we really provide value. So I don't see this like the pandemic or in 2008. Again, we see it a lot, if it happens, like '90 and 2000, and there is still more for talent back then too.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I'll give you an example, David. This is one that kind of floored me in the last month. I won't mention any names, but we have a sizable client that has engaged us on a multimillion dollar contract to improve and help them with their communication with their employee base. This is a significant client, obviously, but they are willing to spend multiple millions of dollars in an outreach to existing employees to make sure they understand why they've got it so great being part of their organization. And communicating what are in the benefits plans, why they take care of them, how they're educating, what the career path is, what the growth of the company means, all those things that go into a solid communication plan, how cool is that?\nDavid Motemaden: No. I mean that is exciting. So yes, it definitely doesn't sound like, at least now you're seeing really any sign of the slowdown. So I guess, maybe just switching gears, if I think about, if we do see a slowdown in next year, I guess one thing that I've noticed the past couple of quarters in the press release sort of in the fine print, there's been mention of office consolidations. And I believe you spoke, Doug, I think last -- on the June call, about the agile workforce strategy. So I guess, could you maybe just talk a little bit more about what you're doing on the real estate front? And if maybe that could be a bigger benefit or a bigger lever to pull if we do get into a tougher revenue backdrop? And maybe if you could put some numbers around potential saves, that would also be helpful?\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think when we talked about it early, when we were coming out of the pandemic, we thought there could be $30 million or $40 million or $50 million of annualized savings coming from real estate. I think we're still on target about that. I think we're harvesting maybe about $8 million a year on that effort, and there's a couple of big office footprints that are coming up here in the next year that I think that maybe will be a little bit more on that over this next year. What are we doing? We're going to an office footprint that basically is covering 50% or so of the number of employees that we have. We're bringing technologies to bear, so their ads are within the work, so they're not dedicated locations. For those employees that have to come in every day, clearly, they have a designated spot. And we're finding that the employees are responding to it very well, especially in cities where there is a substantial commute. So I see us continuing to do that. I don't know whether it would be a more rapid exercise if we had a normal recession over the next year. I think the pace that we're making change is the pace that the organization has. And you got to -- either you wait until the lease expires and then downsize or you get out of it and you end up paying the rent to the rest of the term. So I think a paced and measured approach to that is where we are, and I don't see that changing if there was this normal recession happening over the next year.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I'll tell you, again, on the anecdote side, these plans were a foot, Doug, leading the charge on this prior to the pandemic. And I don't know about your experience. But my experience in telling people that this isn't their workstation anymore or that, that office is -- it's not a good experience. And people being able to go home and get their job done and come back in the office where we do believe the social connections are important, and we're not eliminating our footprints but allowing them to plug in, in a plug-and-play way on the days that they should be there for customer contact, for employee meetings. It's kind of like the pandemic was a real helper.\nDavid Motemaden: Yes, I know it sounds like -- sorry, go ahead.\nDoug Howell: And that is really, if you don't get the -- you leave the office is too big, it can kind of look like there's no vibe going out in the office. So we do a lot of things to make sure that we can track the workforce. The footprint responds to the workforce. It's like going into a restaurant and every other table is empty, it doesn't feel like there's much of a vibe. Same number of people in a smaller restaurant, you walk out saying, wow, that was really a happening place tonight. So we're trying to make those experiences when people come into the office, more collaborative, more near one each other, and it's actually working then. We were just in London not too long ago, and there's a real bounce in everybody step when they come into a full office.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes. Doug is just trying to do the age thing on me because I go to a full restaurant, I can't hear...\nDavid Motemaden: Yes. No, I agree with all of those changes. And so yes, it sounds like $20 million to $30 million of a benefit, but it sounds like that's maybe a bit more gradual unless things change.\nDoug Howell: Yes. I mean over a couple of years, 3.5 years. we'll get it.\nOperator:  Our next questions come from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nGreg Peters: You provided a pretty robust answer about the recession and -- or a potential recession and its effect on your brokerage business. But in your answer, you kind of didn't really talk about its effect on the Risk Management business. So maybe -- or if you did, I missed it, so -- because I was more focused on Brokerage. So maybe you could pivot and just tell us about your whiteboard sort of conclusions on the effect of a potential recession on the Risk Management business?\nDoug Howell: I don't think there was substantial employment changes in a normal recession. So with Gallagher Bassett being so tight, to the number of people employed in places where there might be slips and falls, et cetera, I think that -- I'm not saying they're immune to it in this next normal recession, but I think that they're pretty resilient in that right now. Same thing with the Benefits business, there's still competition for talent. I think that there's -- you heard Pat say that there's 11 million open jobs right now for -- and there's 5 million people out work or something like that. So I think that I personally believe that this next -- if there's a slowdown, it's about drying up excess demand versus supply. And Scott pays claims on what the supply is not the demand. And we sell stuff on supply, not demand. So I think that -- I think as business...\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes. And Greg, you heard us say that of all the lines of cover right now that are adjusted by Gallagher Bassett where comp is still one line that's not -- and it's our core business in the U.S. is not back to prepandemic claim counts. So it takes a while to build that back. But that's, as Doug said, directly connected to the employee head count. And so employee head count -- if employee head counts get slashed, that will have an impact on Scott's business, if they stay stable. And what we're seeing on the Benefit side is aggressive hiring, aggressive attempts of retention. And I think we're in pretty good shape.\nGreg Peters: I was just -- as you were providing the answer, I was recalling an old and I never really tested it out to know whether it was true or not. But as a recession -- as there was an onset of recession that claim counts -- workers' comp claim counts actually increase as more employees sharing the worst would slip and fall in advance of actually facing the Grim Reaper, I don't know if that's something that is...\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I think that's an old life tale.\nGreg Peters: Yes. Yes. Exactly.\nDoug Howell: That as workers' comp premium rates increase, and we're not fully into big jumps in workers' comp. But if we get a harder market in workers' comp that will push more people to self-insurance, and that leads to pretty good growth for Gallagher Bassett, too. So when they look at self-insurance and alternatives. So if we go into a recession, but workers' comp rates go up as medical costs inflate, et cetera, you might have more people looking for self-insurance with Gallagher Bassett paying the claims.\nGreg Peters: Is it -- is it your view that the work from home versus work from work is one of the contributing factors to the lower claim count in workers' comp, at least from what you're seeing in Gallagher Bassett?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No, not really.\nGreg Peters: Okay. Two other questions. From your property answer regarding where your real estate footprint, should I infer that about 20,000 or so of your employees are in full work from home if you said your property is target your real estate footprint is...\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No, no, no. Gallagher Bassett has moved to a more virtual environment and that people are embracing that and really like that. The Brokerage business is allowing agile work. We're working to be agile and to be flexible. But these office footprints can actually handle everybody coming in at the same time, and we are encouraging people to come in.\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think, Greg, the number of people that actually are designated as purely work from home employees might be in the 8,000 person range.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: A big part of that is GB.\nDoug Howell: Right.\nGreg Peters: I'm sorry, what was that last answer, Pat?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: A big part of that is Gallagher Bassett.\nGreg Peters: Okay. And the final, just a detailed question, and I'm sure you've probably provided this before, but I just forget. Is there any cadence to how the cash flow comes out from the energy business as we think about the annual sort of -- is it heavier in the first quarter, are you harvesting it, or is it spread out evenly, et cetera?\nDoug Howell: That probably more closely correlates to the day that we do our estimated tax payments because we can anticipate using those credits. And therefore, we would pay less than estimated tax payment.\nGreg Peters: That's done on a quarterly basis, correct?\nDoug Howell: That's right.\nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist Securities.\nMark Hughes: Pat, the renewal premium number you gave us the 10.5%, was that sort of the global P&C market?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Wait a minute, Mark. I don't think I gave you the renewal premiums. Take a look.\nDoug Howell: Well, I understand you asked about the global second quarter renewal premiums, that's both rate and exposure of 10.5%, yes, that's right. And that's higher....\nMark Hughes: That was 8% in the first quarter. Do I have that right?\nDoug Howell: I'd have to pull up the script on that, but ...\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I do think that's right.\nMark Hughes: Okay. All right. And then I'll say this slightly tongue in cheek, but also seriously. West Virginia Senator, Joe Manchin, does he like the clean coal business?\nDoug Howell: I think he does. I mean, he's got a lot of interest in it. The real question is, is he willing to sponsor a change in this as a part of a compromised plan? So we'll find that out over the next week or 10 days or 10 months, right? I don't think there'll be a focus -- it's a pretty small program to be honest. So I think that they're trying to get a deal done. Is this something that he's willing to champion? Maybe not, but we'll see what happens when we get into next week.\nMark Hughes: In the MGA business within wholesale, the 4% organic, do you think that will continue at that level? Or is there anything unusual this quarter?\nDoug Howell: No, I think it's pretty -- it's just the nature of some of those programs and MGU...\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes, It should hold.\nDoug Howell: Should hold, not be better.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: That's pretty -- that stuff is pretty subject, Mark, to the economy. It's bars opening, restaurants opening, contractors starting with the wheelbarrow. Houses that get hit by hail a lot.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Okay. And then did I hear you comment on workers' comp pricing. I know you talked about claims frequency and a lot of other factors. But how about pricing in the quarter flat?\nDoug Howell: On rate amount, it's growing. It's actually showing some nice mid-single-digit type growth numbers right now.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: But rates are flat.\nDoug Howell: That's right.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: It seems to be in line that our carrier partners are happy to continue to grow and are satisfied with the results.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Just a couple of quick ones. First off, when we look at supplementals and contingents, as a percentage of core commissions and fees, they're down year-over-year. Is that reinsurance?\nDoug Howell: It could have an impact on -- yes, that would be. And I think a good point on that, our supplementals and contingents, there is some difference in contract year-over-year. So it's always good look at those 2 in together, not individual. So -- but together, they were up 12% this quarter together.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. And then a second question on reinsurance. How comfortable are you with the idea that the breakage that you factored in goes away once we get into 2023? Is that can be a factor anymore?\nDoug Howell: I would say it's behind us. So we've done a really good job of holding the teams in. We're not having substantial attrition on that. In fact, I think we're in good shape on that. So I would not expect -- we anticipated what we give them breakage and the team is holding together -- that leadership team has done an amazingly good job.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I've talked about this quarter in and quarter out. I'm really, really happy with and proud of the fact that, that team joined us. 7% organic growth in the second quarter after the 2 to 3 years that they had prior to an acquisition getting completed in December. We're 9 months into this thing, and they're generating 7% organic. That's fantastic. And we were sitting there talking about breakage early on, is there going to be more -- and let's be honest, breakages, people left us and accounts in that business like to work with their team. And so people staying, producing -- the other thing I would comment on is the amount of interaction and the amount of help that reinsurance is to our retail brokerage operations on a global basis is exceeding our expectations. There are risk sharing pools in the United States that we've done longer and better than anybody in the marketplace and along comes a fresh look and fresh markets and a team that works together with us. The data sharing, the discussion of our partner markets and the sharing there, it's almost unbelievable to me on a multiple number of levels, how good a fit this is.\nMeyer Shields: That's tremendously positive. And then one last question. I know this is nitpicky. But the large life deal that came in June, is that something that occurs next year? Is this a onetime deal?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Onetime deal.\nDoug Howell: We get them from time to time, but I wouldn't say that they're annually predictable year-over-year.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Right.\nDoug Howell: Then they themselves remain...\nMeyer Shields: I'm sorry.\nDoug Howell: They bind when they bind. It's not like it's saying you've got to have this all put to bed by January 1, by October 1. It doesn't really drive necessarily with the calendar or fiscal year of the client. It's whenever they want to put these cases in place is when they were buying. So it would not be predictable quarter over quarter over quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is come from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS.\nWeston Bloomer: My first one is on -- just a follow-up on Willis Re. Obviously, good organic there of 7%. With investments ahead of schedule, I'm curious how you're thinking about growth and margin improvement in that business in 2023? Could we potentially see organic come in above the 7%? How should we think about potential margin improvement? Would it potentially grow faster than the core portfolio currently?\nDoug Howell: Well, that margin for the year is somewhere around 36%. So I think that we're very happy with that margin. I think holding that margin is the right answer for that business. It takes heavy investment. They've been underinvested for the last 3 or 4 years on that. So that is not a business, if you go back to our acquisition that was expecting substantial margin change on that. So we're happy with the margins the way they are. We think they're competitive. Sure, there will be opportunities for us to become more efficient, and we do that every year. We always become more efficient. But I think there's a ripe opportunity right now to hire brokers in that space that would like to join us. It's a hot thing going right now. So it would be nice to take and hire folks in that business. I think it's 34% for the year where we are.\nWeston Bloomer: Got it. And then my follow-up is just on M&A. Curious on what you're seeing on the international M&A market. Is that more attractive from a multiple perspective or a competition perspective right now? Or is maybe your term sheet disclosure more international U.S. weighted versus historical? Just kind of curious on what you're seeing.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: It's not more international weighted. It's about the same and multiples around the world, you can throw a hat over.\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Weston. Thanks for being on the call, Weston. Nice to hear from you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: All of you by the way, Doug, let's not single in -- all right, I think that's our questions for now. I'd like to thank everyone on the call again for joining us. Obviously, we're excited. We had a fantastic second quarter and first half of 2022. I'd like to thank all our colleagues around the globe for their hard work, our carrier partners for their ongoing support and our clients for their continued trust. We look forward to speaking to you again at our September Investor Day meeting, and thank you all, everyone, for being with us.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great night.",

            "name": "Doug Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone, an excellent second quarter and terrific count. Today, I'll touch on organic margins and the Corporate segment using our earnings release and then make some comments using our CFO commentary document posted on our website. I'll end then with my typical comments on M&A, debt and cash. Okay, starting with the earnings release to the Brokerage segment organic table on Page 3. Fantastic headline all-in brokerage organic of 10.8%. As Pat said, we did benefit by about 1 point or so because of a large group live case found in late June. With or without that, a great quarter by our sales team. As for the rest of '22, during our June IR Day, we said third and fourth quarter would be somewhere around 8% due to a tough benefits compare. As we sit today, we're still seeing third quarter around that 8%, reflecting about 1 point of that tough benefits compare, and we're becoming more bullish in fourth quarter, call it nicely over 8% in the fourth quarter. That would lead to full year Brokerage segment organic growth of over 9%. So today, we're forecasting full year organic growth better than what we were seeing at our June IR Day. Next, turning to Page 5 to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Headline all-in adjusted EBITDAC margin of 32%, right in line with our June IR day expectation. Recall what we've been saying all year, because of the roll-in impact of the acquired reinsurance operations, which has substantial quarterly seasonality and because there are still expenses returning as we come out of the pandemic, those in combination create quarterly margin change volatility. As a recap, we posted adjusted margins up 50 basis points in the first quarter, down 97 basis points here in the second, and we're forecasting down 100 basis points in the third, then back up 100 basis points in the fourth. Because we are seasonally the largest in the first quarter, those results would roll-up to around 10 to 20 basis points of full year margin expansion. These quarterly margin changes are right on what we've been saying all year. When I think of the inflation impact, I just don't see much here in '22 on our expenses. And as we discussed in June, headline inflation doesn't significantly impact 80% of our expense base. And we have mitigation levers to pull on that other 20% if it comes to that. So even with rising CPI, we remain comfortable with our 2020 margin outlook. Looking towards '23, all that quarter margin change volatility should go away with the pandemic behind us and reinsurance fully rolled into our books. Moving to the Risk Management segment on Pages 5 and 6, Pat hit the highlights. 10.3% organic and 18.9% adjusted margins, an excellent quarter. This unit continues to show momentum with rebounding claim counts and a large new business win coming on next quarter. It's looking now like organic revenue growth of around 10% in each of third and fourth quarters '22. Now remember, that's on top of 17% growth in third quarter '21 and 13% growth in fourth quarter '21, that would be a terrific outcome to overcome such a difficult compare. Moving to Page 7 of the earnings release to the Corporate segment shortcut table. Interest in banking is within our June IR Day range. Adjusted M&A costs in clean energy, they combined -- those combined also within our range. And Corporate, after adjusting for some favorable tax item, is slightly better than our June IR Day range, call it about $0.01 due to favorable FX remeasurement gains given the strengthening in the dollar. Let's leave the earnings release and go to the CFO commentary document. On Page 3, these are our typical Brokerage and Risk Management modeling helpers. With the rally in the U.S. dollar since our June IR Day, please take a look at our updated FX guidance for the remainder of '22. This late June strengthening also caused an extra $0.01 headwind here in the second quarter versus our IR Day guidance. Next, you'll see our current estimate of integration costs. Most of this is related to Willis Re. The punchline has no change to our original estimate of $250 million for integration charges through the end of 2024. As I mentioned last quarter, the team is making excellent progress and is executing at a faster pace than our original plan. Integration efforts around people, real estate, back-office transition services are targeted to be mostly done by late '22. In fact, our new reinsurance colleagues are now moving into our combined Gallagher locations around the world, and there's an excitement that is coming together. As for technology and system rebuild, we still see having that done by the end of '23 or early '24. So continued good news on the reinsurance integration front. Next, please take a look at the amortization of intangibles line. Recall we now adjust out our -- that out of our non-GAAP results. Also take a look at footnote number 2. That will help you reconcile this number to what we're showing in the face of our GAAP financial statements. Next to the change in estimated earn-out payable. This quarter, some component of the earn-out payable adjustment has become more pronounced. The punchline is found in footnote number 5. The note admittedly is a little account needs, but it's saying that the large noncash gain in our results this quarter is mostly due to increases in interest rates and market volatility. When these increase, the value of our earn-out liability declines, thus creating GAAP income. This gain does not reflect any meaningful change to our expectations of the acquired brokerages nor does it change our view of what we'll ultimately pay an earn-out. The accounting is a bit like the change in interest rate assumptions and pension accounting, except this change in earn-out liability goes to the P&L, not through OCI as does pensions. In our view, this is a no never mind but can dramatically impact comparability, so we adjusted out. Turning now to Page 4, our Corporate segment outlook. No changes in the third and fourth quarter estimates. Flipping to Page 5, Clean Energy. This page is here to highlight that we have around $1 billion of tax credit carryovers. And with the Sunset program late last year, we're now in the cash harvesting year of these investments. You'll see in the pinkish column that the 2022 cash flow increase should be $125 million to $150 million and perhaps more in '23 and beyond. At this rate, these investments will be a really nice 7-year cash flow sweetener. The possibility of an extension of the loss still exists, so we have idled our plans rather than decommissioning them, cost us a little to carry them, but it lets us remain well positioned to restart production if an extension happens. Turning to Page 6. The top of the page is the rollover revenue table that we've spoken about in detail. We appreciate all those that have incorporated this disclosure into their models. Moving down the page. The bottom table is an update on our December reinsurance acquisition. You'll see that these numbers are almost spot on to our June IR Day estimates. Delivering $730 million of revenue and nearly $260 million of adjusted EBITDAC here in '22 would be very close to our pro formas when we inked the deal. That would be a really good outcome. Moving on to cash and capital management and future M&A. At June 30, available cash on hand was about $450 million. Our operations continue to perform very well, and we expect strong operating cash flows. Add to that, the cash flow sweetener from our Clean Energy investments and additional borrowing capacity, it adds up to more than $4 billion of tuck-in M&A capacity here in '22 and '23 combined. So those are my comments. An excellent quarter and first half, and we're extremely well positioned for another terrific year. Back to you, Pat. So let me pile on that a little bit because we don't want whiteboarding on that. Like that, we're not seeing daily indications of our customers' growth slowing at this point. And admittedly, that's looking at current and recent past activity. And I think your question is really more about a future slowdown. So when we looked at that, what kind of cooling might we see, whether it's a recession or just a slowdown in the economy because, obviously, not every recession is the same, we do a lot of work on that. And we see -- if it happens, when I say if, more like a normal recession, maybe more like 1990, '91, and again, of what happened maybe in 2000, 2001, and before 9/11. We do not see next year being a clinch like the subprime financial shock recession of '07 or '08 or the pandemic recession for a few months of '20. So it's also important to note that these more normal recessions in the early '90s and early 2000s, both lasted about 8 months. So we see it more like that. It's also -- it's an important point to remember that brokers -- we are in a very large portion of our revenues based on the amount of premium placed. If it goes up because of rate or because of exposure, frankly, we're a little bit different on that. So for us, we think that like taking a look at nominal GDP is the bigger factor for our revenue much more than real GDP. So absolute sales, payroll, like Pat said, and property values are what premiums are placed on. So when you say, what thoughts next year what will premium rate increases do? And you heard us say that we don't see them slowing over the next year or so. And then really, our spread between new business and loss, we're proficient broker. So selling more insurance than we lose every year. So when we put all that together for next year, the brokerage business during a normal recession during an inflating premium rate environment can still post terrific organic results. So that's how we're seeing it now. And I talked to you about on the expense side during June that we think that we have some mitigating factors for that 20% that might be highly exposed to the inflation component of that. So it's a long answer to your question between Pat and I on it, but we think '23 could still be a year of terrific organic growth. I just think sustained rate increases, and our teams are doing a great job of selling more than we're losing. So I think that just the environment seems to be better. We're starting to see data come out of what's happening with second quarter rates versus first. And there might have been just a little bit of rate drop in the first quarter, and that seems to be back on a positive slope now. So you see that kind of in first quarters when you go back over the last few years that maybe rate increases aren't quite as big as they are in later quarters because you get -- for the carriers, they get the full year of the premium in the books by being maybe a little bit more competitive in the first quarter. Second quarter bounced back up again. I think that we've had a chance to look at what's in our pipeline. So I would say it's on all fronts, we're just feeling more optimistic about where we're seeing the second half. It's about the same. So it doesn't have the leverage as you would see in some of the other incremental amount. We adjust that out of our margin profile. So it would be just on the revenue side. Well, it's a 742 page draft bill that we're doing a lot of word searches on it. I'm not seeing how it's in that, but if you get into the kind of vote-a-rama in the Senate next week to see what other senators might want to include in the package or look at it, I think that -- we're never out of it until -- we're not. And even if it doesn't come through in this package, it could be later in the year or 2. So it doesn't cost us that much to carry the plant. Our utility partners have been very understanding about this. They're not pressing us to decommission. So if you -- that we have to carry it for another 6 months, we will. But if it happens, it would be great. If not, we're in the cash harvesting era just like we thought about for the last 15 years, we're at that point now. So harvesting the cash is pretty nice. Yes. Let me add to that. There's -- during the pandemic, people were all about cost containment. And so they cut down their cost and they were cut any discretionary costs. It's regardless of what happens with this recession. And all the Fed actions, I think -- I don't -- I just don't believe that it's going to have a dramatic impact on unemployment. So I think that employers are really thinking about attracting, retaining and motivating their talent. So I just don't see any type of 8 months or yearlong recession putting a dent in the employment numbers. So employers are still going to have to make sure they're out there competing for talent, and that's where we really provide value. So I don't see this like the pandemic or in 2008. Again, we see it a lot, if it happens, like '90 and 2000, and there is still more for talent back then too. Yes. I think when we talked about it early, when we were coming out of the pandemic, we thought there could be $30 million or $40 million or $50 million of annualized savings coming from real estate. I think we're still on target about that. I think we're harvesting maybe about $8 million a year on that effort, and there's a couple of big office footprints that are coming up here in the next year that I think that maybe will be a little bit more on that over this next year. What are we doing? We're going to an office footprint that basically is covering 50% or so of the number of employees that we have. We're bringing technologies to bear, so their ads are within the work, so they're not dedicated locations. For those employees that have to come in every day, clearly, they have a designated spot. And we're finding that the employees are responding to it very well, especially in cities where there is a substantial commute. So I see us continuing to do that. I don't know whether it would be a more rapid exercise if we had a normal recession over the next year. I think the pace that we're making change is the pace that the organization has. And you got to -- either you wait until the lease expires and then downsize or you get out of it and you end up paying the rent to the rest of the term. So I think a paced and measured approach to that is where we are, and I don't see that changing if there was this normal recession happening over the next year. And that is really, if you don't get the -- you leave the office is too big, it can kind of look like there's no vibe going out in the office. So we do a lot of things to make sure that we can track the workforce. The footprint responds to the workforce. It's like going into a restaurant and every other table is empty, it doesn't feel like there's much of a vibe. Same number of people in a smaller restaurant, you walk out saying, wow, that was really a happening place tonight. So we're trying to make those experiences when people come into the office, more collaborative, more near one each other, and it's actually working then. We were just in London not too long ago, and there's a real bounce in everybody step when they come into a full office. Yes. I mean over a couple of years, 3.5 years. we'll get it. I don't think there was substantial employment changes in a normal recession. So with Gallagher Bassett being so tight, to the number of people employed in places where there might be slips and falls, et cetera, I think that -- I'm not saying they're immune to it in this next normal recession, but I think that they're pretty resilient in that right now. Same thing with the Benefits business, there's still competition for talent. I think that there's -- you heard Pat say that there's 11 million open jobs right now for -- and there's 5 million people out work or something like that. So I think that I personally believe that this next -- if there's a slowdown, it's about drying up excess demand versus supply. And Scott pays claims on what the supply is not the demand. And we sell stuff on supply, not demand. So I think that -- I think as business... That as workers' comp premium rates increase, and we're not fully into big jumps in workers' comp. But if we get a harder market in workers' comp that will push more people to self-insurance, and that leads to pretty good growth for Gallagher Bassett, too. So when they look at self-insurance and alternatives. So if we go into a recession, but workers' comp rates go up as medical costs inflate, et cetera, you might have more people looking for self-insurance with Gallagher Bassett paying the claims. Yes. I think, Greg, the number of people that actually are designated as purely work from home employees might be in the 8,000 person range. Right. That probably more closely correlates to the day that we do our estimated tax payments because we can anticipate using those credits. And therefore, we would pay less than estimated tax payment. That's right. Well, I understand you asked about the global second quarter renewal premiums, that's both rate and exposure of 10.5%, yes, that's right. And that's higher.... I'd have to pull up the script on that, but ... I think he does. I mean, he's got a lot of interest in it. The real question is, is he willing to sponsor a change in this as a part of a compromised plan? So we'll find that out over the next week or 10 days or 10 months, right? I don't think there'll be a focus -- it's a pretty small program to be honest. So I think that they're trying to get a deal done. Is this something that he's willing to champion? Maybe not, but we'll see what happens when we get into next week. No, I think it's pretty -- it's just the nature of some of those programs and MGU... Should hold, not be better. On rate amount, it's growing. It's actually showing some nice mid-single-digit type growth numbers right now. That's right. It could have an impact on -- yes, that would be. And I think a good point on that, our supplementals and contingents, there is some difference in contract year-over-year. So it's always good look at those 2 in together, not individual. So -- but together, they were up 12% this quarter together. I would say it's behind us. So we've done a really good job of holding the teams in. We're not having substantial attrition on that. In fact, I think we're in good shape on that. So I would not expect -- we anticipated what we give them breakage and the team is holding together -- that leadership team has done an amazingly good job. We get them from time to time, but I wouldn't say that they're annually predictable year-over-year. Then they themselves remain... They bind when they bind. It's not like it's saying you've got to have this all put to bed by January 1, by October 1. It doesn't really drive necessarily with the calendar or fiscal year of the client. It's whenever they want to put these cases in place is when they were buying. So it would not be predictable quarter over quarter over quarter. Well, that margin for the year is somewhere around 36%. So I think that we're very happy with that margin. I think holding that margin is the right answer for that business. It takes heavy investment. They've been underinvested for the last 3 or 4 years on that. So that is not a business, if you go back to our acquisition that was expecting substantial margin change on that. So we're happy with the margins the way they are. We think they're competitive. Sure, there will be opportunities for us to become more efficient, and we do that every year. We always become more efficient. But I think there's a ripe opportunity right now to hire brokers in that space that would like to join us. It's a hot thing going right now. So it would be nice to take and hire folks in that business. I think it's 34% for the year where we are. Thanks, Weston. Thanks for being on the call, Weston. Nice to hear from you."

            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO; as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had another excellent quarter of financial performance. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 22% growth in revenue, 10.7% organic growth, net earnings growth of 35%, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 23% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 19%. I'm extremely proud of how our nearly 41,000 colleagues around the globe performed during the quarter in the first half of the year. So let me give you some more detail on our second quarter Brokerage segment performance. During the quarter, reported revenue growth was 25%. Of that, 10.8% was organic. We did have a tailwind of about 1 point from an infrequent large life case that I'll touch on in a minute. Rollover revenues were about $240 million, consistent with our June IR Day expectations. Net earnings growth was 36%. And as expected, we posted adjusted EBITDAC margins of 32%, an outstanding quarter for the Brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and break down our organic, starting with our PC operations. Our U.S. retail business posted 11% organic, with strong new business, retention and continued renewal premium increases. Risk Placement Services, our U.S. wholesale operations, posted organic of 8%. This includes more than 15% organic in open brokerage and 4% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business was consistent with second quarter of '21, while retention was down just a bit from last year, as we noted in our June IR Day. Shifting outside the U.S. Our U.K. businesses posted organic of 8% with excellent new business overall and another double-digit organic growth quarter within specialty. Australia and New Zealand combined organic was more than 11%, driven by strong new business, stable retention and higher renewal premium increases. Canada was up more than 14% organically and continues to benefit from renewal premium increases, great new business and great retention. Moving to our Employee Benefits Brokerage and Consulting business. As I mentioned earlier, we were helped this quarter from a large life case. Excluding this, our benefits business organic was about 9%, in line with our IR Day expectations and driven by increased HR benefits consulting work and solid growth in our International and Health and Welfare businesses. Finally, our December reinsurance acquisition is right on target. After controlling for breakage prior to closing, second quarter organic was around 7%, just fantastic, and integration continues to progress nicely on budget and ahead of its original time line. So reinsurance continues to be a really good story. So headline Brokerage segment all in organic of 10.8% and upper 9% after controlling for the large life case, either way, an excellent quarter. Next, let me give you some thoughts on the current PC market environment, starting in the primary insurance market. Overall, global second quarter renewal premiums, that's both rate and exposure combined, were up 10.5%. That's higher than what our data showed for increases in renewal premiums in both the fourth quarter '21 and first quarter '22. When I look at our renewal premiums by line for nearly all coverages, second quarter increases were equal to or higher than first quarter. One exception to this was professional liability, mostly D&O. By geography, renewal premiums were up double digits, nearly everywhere. Again, that's a combination of both rate and exposure. So next to no slowdown in premium increases during the quarter. Additionally, we are not seeing any significant signs of economic slowdown. In fact, second quarter midterm policy endorsements, audits and cancellations continue to trend more favorable than a year ago. Thus far in July, midterm policy endorsements continue to move higher year-over-year, and renewal premium increases are consistent with second quarter. But remember, our job as brokers is to help our clients mitigate premium increases and find suitable insurance programs that fit their budgets. Moving to reinsurance. As we noted in our first view report published by our reinsurance professionals earlier this month, there are very real signs of hardening in the reinsurance market. Property reinsurance pricing is up across the board. And most notably, for U.S. hurricane and Australian property risks are up anywhere from 15% to more than 40%. On the casualty side, reinsurance placements experienced more modest price increases and were a little bit less challenging. Regardless, a firm or hardening reinsurance market will naturally show up in primary market rate increases. And there are many other reasons for our carrier partners to maintain their cautious underwriting stance outside of reinsurance market conditions, inflation, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty to name a few. These all translate into a difficult PC market conditions continuing for our clients across retail, wholesale and reinsurance for this foreseeable future. Moving to our Employee Benefit Brokerage and Consulting business, U.S. labor market conditions remained broadly favorable. Even with a decline in U.S. job postings in each of the last 2 months, there remain more than 11 million job openings, that's more than double the number of people unemployed and looking for work. We expect strong demand for our HR and benefits consulting services to continue as businesses prioritize attracting, retaining and motivating their workforce. The timing of the large life case and covered live changes in the second half of '21 will cause the Benefits business to post lumpy quarterly organic results this year, but that doesn't change the still favorable underlying environment. So let me wrap up on the Brokerage segment organic. A great first half and looking like the second half will lead us to a full year '22 organic over 9%, which would be an absolutely terrific year. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. During the second quarter, we completed 8 new tuck-in brokerage mergers representing about $50 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have more than 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing nearly $350 million of annualized revenue. We know not all of these will close, however, we believe we will get our fair share. Next, I would like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Second quarter organic growth was 10.3%, a bit better than our IR Day expectation due to a strong June. Adjusted EBITDAC margin was 18.9%, which is in line with our expectations. For the year, we continue to see adjusted EBITDAC margins near that 19% level. We again saw increases in new arising claims across general liability, property and core workers' compensation during the quarter. Encouragingly, property and liability claim counts are back to prepandemic levels. Core workers' comp claim counts have yet to fully rebound to 2019 levels, which represents a nice opportunity for further growth. Looking towards the second half of the year, we think organic revenue growth will continue to push 10% due to growing claim counts and new business. I'll conclude my remarks with some thoughts on our bedrock culture. As I resume traveling to our Gallagher offices around the globe, I can report to you that our culture is as strong as ever, and that's a reflection of our people, our nearly 41,000 colleagues working together for a common goal to serve our clients. As I've said before, our people underpin our culture, a culture that we believe is a true competitive advantage and drives our outstanding financial results. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thanks, Doug. Daryl, I think we're ready to open it up to questions. Well, I think it's not all that different than the discussion that we had in June. We're seeing -- literally, we look at this daily, an interesting pattern of our underlying clients' business is doing well. They're still recruiting people. Our benefits HR folks are as busy as they can possibly be. We watch for adjustments, both in terms of audits and endorsements, and those are all positive right now. To put that in perspective, we have -- we do have a baseline on that during the pandemic, and it was -- that was obviously substantially upside down. So we do have a good feel for that, and we feel good about it. Inflation, as Doug said, really has an impact on about 20% of our expenses. I think that's probably good research on the team's part in terms of what's really subject to that, that we'll be watching. As you know, we're going into budget time in the next 6 weeks or so, and there's a lot of discussion around this. So don't hold me to it, but I think that we're pretty -- in a pretty good spot. And I think our mix of business bodes well. I think that the -- the way our expenses shake out, an awful lot of those expenses are variable, I think that's good. A lot of upside for our salespeople this year, obviously. And I think that with rate increases, with interest rates up, it's a pretty good environment for a broker. But let me load in another thought to, Elyse, we didn't talk about June. But if you go back to 2007, 2008, you go back to the pandemic clinches, we were -- we learned again, which we have through many tough times that our clients will stop paying their people before they stop paying their premiums. And that's a pretty good business to be in regardless of the economy. No. I think brokers are opportunistic, smart people. If I had a business to sell, now is when I'd sell it. I'll tell you. It's really interesting to see. As you can imagine, I think we talked about this when the pandemic hit, that business shutdown in a quarter. And now -- and what an interesting turnaround for our clients. Now their biggest problem is attracting and retaining. So there is this demand, frankly, at a level that exceeds what we saw prepandemic. And I think in that case, things were kind of going along well. Everything was kind of fine. And then everyone tried to come down to the lowest amount of employee base they could. Now they're coming back. Their businesses are back. As we said, when we looked at our adjustments and endorsements and audits, our clients' businesses so far are robust, and that's a demand -- that creates a demand for more people. So I mean I can't get specific with you by exactly which practice group. It's the entire consulting part of our employee, human resource and human capital business is doing extremely well this year. I'll give you an example, David. This is one that kind of floored me in the last month. I won't mention any names, but we have a sizable client that has engaged us on a multimillion dollar contract to improve and help them with their communication with their employee base. This is a significant client, obviously, but they are willing to spend multiple millions of dollars in an outreach to existing employees to make sure they understand why they've got it so great being part of their organization. And communicating what are in the benefits plans, why they take care of them, how they're educating, what the career path is, what the growth of the company means, all those things that go into a solid communication plan, how cool is that? I'll tell you, again, on the anecdote side, these plans were a foot, Doug, leading the charge on this prior to the pandemic. And I don't know about your experience. But my experience in telling people that this isn't their workstation anymore or that, that office is -- it's not a good experience. And people being able to go home and get their job done and come back in the office where we do believe the social connections are important, and we're not eliminating our footprints but allowing them to plug in, in a plug-and-play way on the days that they should be there for customer contact, for employee meetings. It's kind of like the pandemic was a real helper. Yes. Doug is just trying to do the age thing on me because I go to a full restaurant, I can't hear... Yes. And Greg, you heard us say that of all the lines of cover right now that are adjusted by Gallagher Bassett where comp is still one line that's not -- and it's our core business in the U.S. is not back to prepandemic claim counts. So it takes a while to build that back. But that's, as Doug said, directly connected to the employee head count. And so employee head count -- if employee head counts get slashed, that will have an impact on Scott's business, if they stay stable. And what we're seeing on the Benefit side is aggressive hiring, aggressive attempts of retention. And I think we're in pretty good shape. I think that's an old life tale. No, not really. No, no, no. Gallagher Bassett has moved to a more virtual environment and that people are embracing that and really like that. The Brokerage business is allowing agile work. We're working to be agile and to be flexible. But these office footprints can actually handle everybody coming in at the same time, and we are encouraging people to come in. A big part of that is GB. A big part of that is Gallagher Bassett. Wait a minute, Mark. I don't think I gave you the renewal premiums. Take a look. I do think that's right. Yes, It should hold. That's pretty -- that stuff is pretty subject, Mark, to the economy. It's bars opening, restaurants opening, contractors starting with the wheelbarrow. Houses that get hit by hail a lot. But rates are flat. It seems to be in line that our carrier partners are happy to continue to grow and are satisfied with the results. I've talked about this quarter in and quarter out. I'm really, really happy with and proud of the fact that, that team joined us. 7% organic growth in the second quarter after the 2 to 3 years that they had prior to an acquisition getting completed in December. We're 9 months into this thing, and they're generating 7% organic. That's fantastic. And we were sitting there talking about breakage early on, is there going to be more -- and let's be honest, breakages, people left us and accounts in that business like to work with their team. And so people staying, producing -- the other thing I would comment on is the amount of interaction and the amount of help that reinsurance is to our retail brokerage operations on a global basis is exceeding our expectations. There are risk sharing pools in the United States that we've done longer and better than anybody in the marketplace and along comes a fresh look and fresh markets and a team that works together with us. The data sharing, the discussion of our partner markets and the sharing there, it's almost unbelievable to me on a multiple number of levels, how good a fit this is. Onetime deal. Right. It's not more international weighted. It's about the same and multiples around the world, you can throw a hat over. All of you by the way, Doug, let's not single in -- all right, I think that's our questions for now. I'd like to thank everyone on the call again for joining us. Obviously, we're excited. We had a fantastic second quarter and first half of 2022. I'd like to thank all our colleagues around the globe for their hard work, our carrier partners for their ongoing support and our clients for their continued trust. We look forward to speaking to you again at our September Investor Day meeting, and thank you all, everyone, for being with us."

It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had a fantastic start to the year. For the first quarter, our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments posted 30% growth in revenue, more than 10% organic growth, net earnings growth of 28%, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 34%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 26%. And we were named a world\u2019s most ethical company for the 11th year in a row, an outstanding achievement on its own and a testament to our nearly 40,000 professionals around the globe. As you can tell, I am extremely proud of how the team performed during the quarter. So, let me give you some more detail on our first quarter Brokerage segment performance. During the quarter, reported revenue growth was 32%. Of that, 9.6% was organic, which is just excellent. Rollover revenues of $380 million were pretty consistent with our March IR Day expectations and mostly driven by the December Reinsurance Brokerage acquisition. Doug will have some further comments on rollover revenues in his prepared remarks. Net earnings growth was 27%. Adjusted EBITDAC growth was 35%. And we expanded our adjusted EBITDAC margin by about 50 basis points, an outstanding all-around quarter for the brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and breakdown the 9.6% organic, starting with our PC operations. First, our domestic retail business posted 11% organic driven by terrific new business, strong retention, and continued renewal premium increases. Risk placement services, our domestic wholesale operations, posted organic of 10%. This includes more than 20% organic in open brokerage and 6% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business was better than first quarter \u201821 levels and retention was consistent with prior year. Outside the U.S., our UK business posted organic of 14%. Within retail, fantastic new business and continued renewal premium increases helped drive 10% organic. In our London specialty business, including our legacy Gallagher Re operations, saw 17% organic. Australia and New Zealand combined organic was nearly 10% driven by strong new business, stable retention and higher renewal premium increases. And finally, Canada was up more than 12% organically and continues to benefit from renewal premium increases and great new business production. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business, first quarter organic was up over 7%, more than 1 point better than our March IRD expectation. Our core health and welfare organic was in line with our expectations of 5% and the upside in the quarter was driven by our international operations and our HR consulting, pharmacy benefits and various other life insurance product sales. So, 7% organic in benefits, 11% organic within our PC operations, an excellent quarter. Next, I\u2019d like to make a few comments on the PC market. Overall, global first quarter renewal premium increases were 8%, consistent with the fourth quarter of \u201821 after controlling for line of coverage mix differences. Recall, the renewal premium change includes both rate and exposure. So, let me break that down around the world. About 10% in U.S. retail, including double-digit increases in property, professional liability and casualty somewhat offset by workers\u2019 comp and commercial auto. In Canada, New Zealand, renewal premiums were up about 8.5%, with professional liability seeing the strongest increases. In Australia and UK retail, renewal premiums were up mid single-digits driven by increases in casualty and package. Within RPS, wholesale open brokerage premium increases were up 11% and binding operations were up 6%. And in our London specialty business, we saw first quarter rate increases around 7.5%. Moving to reinsurance, as we noted in January, our 1/1 renewals showed price increases that varied by geography and client loss experience. And while rate tended to be based on client-specific attributes in loss history, even loss-free programs faced modest rate increases. Our April Gallagher Re first review report is more focused on Japanese renewals, which tend to dominate the April 1 renewal season. We saw pricing increases in property-related classes, while casualty pricing was flattish despite inflation being a key topic of discussion. You can access our April reinsurance market report on our website for more information. So whether retail, wholesale or reinsurance premiums are still increasing almost everywhere. Looking forward, we expect our mix shift away from workers\u2019 compensation renewals in Q1 to U.S. property cat renewals in Q2 will lead to premium increases in the second quarter, very similar to full year 2021. And we see these difficult PC market conditions continuing throughout the remainder of this year. Carriers will likely continue their cautious underwriting stance due to rising loss costs and increases in reinsurance pricing. And this comes at a time when the conflict in Ukraine is elevating geopolitical uncertainty, courts are reopening and global monetary policy is tightening. So from our seat, it looks like carriers will continue to push for rate and don\u2019t see a dramatic change in the near-term. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business, I see domestic labor market conditions in \u201822 working in our favor. There are more than 11 million job openings in the U.S. That\u2019s 5 million more jobs available than people unemployed in looking for work. And that imbalance lays the groundwork for robust demand for our HR and benefits consulting services as employers look to attract, retain and motivate their workforce. So, we finished first quarter with organic of 9.6%. Given our first quarter results and the current insurance market conditions, as we sit here today, we think 22% organic should end up even better than \u201821. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions, starting with some comments on our recent reinsurance acquisition. Integration is progressing at a fast pace and is ahead of schedule. Alongside the speed that we are executing comes the pull-forward of some of the future integration costs, which Doug will cover in his remarks. Also, we had a strong first quarter with the legacy Gallagher Re team growing 30% and our new reinsurance operations delivering towards $340 million of revenue and over $170 million in EBITDAC. And our reinsurance colleagues are melding together extremely well. So, it continues to be a really good story. During the first quarter, we completed 5 new tuck-in brokerage mergers, representing about $32 million of estimated annualized revenues. I\u2019d like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have around 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing nearly $250 million of annualized revenue. We know not all of these will close. However, we believe we will get our fair share. Next, I\u2019d like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was 15.2%, better than our IR Day expectation due to a strong March, some new business wins and higher-than-expected COVID claims. Adjusted EBITDAC margin was 17.3% and would have been 18.5%, but we had a litigation settlement late in the quarter. Moving forward, we think the remaining \u201822 quarterly margins will be closer to our 19% expectation. We again saw increases in new arising claims across general liability, property, and to a lesser extent, core workers\u2019 compensation during the quarter. New arising COVID claims were well above what we saw during the fourth quarter. However, core claim counts, which tend to have a greater impact on results, still have room to rebound fully to pre-COVID levels. Looking forward, we see ample opportunity for organic revenue growth from existing clients, growing claim counts and new business and expect organic to be around 10% per quarter for the remainder of the year. And let me finish with some thoughts on our bedrock culture. I believe our outstanding financial results are made possible because we are able to act as one company, united by one set of values, the Gallagher Way. As I mentioned earlier, we were once again named a world\u2019s most ethical company by Ethisphere, a truly global effort that reflects our colleagues\u2019 care and integrity to each other and our clients. Every day, I hear stories of our colleagues working together as one team to give our clients exactly what they need all around the world. That collaboration is possible because we genuinely want to deliver the best possible service at all times. When one team wins, we all win. And then there is the way our people give back to their communities. In March, we announced a special matching donation to provide humanitarian relief to the people of Ukraine. Thanks to the generosity of my Gallagher colleagues. We are able to donate over $1 million for necessities like food, water, supplies and first aid. I am proud to stand together with my Gallagher colleagues impacting communities around the world, and that is the Gallagher way. Okay, I\u2019ll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Pat and hello, everyone. As Pat said, a fantastic first quarter and start to the year. Today, I will get to my typical comments on organic margins, clean energy, cash, etcetera and I will also do a financial recap of the Willis Re acquisition, but first, the modeling heads-up regarding rollover revenues this quarter. We typically don\u2019t comment on consensus estimates, but this quarter looks like there is a large variance in brokerage segment rollover revenues relative to the guidance numbers we provided within our CFO commentary document during our March 16 IR Day. When we get to Page 6 of today\u2019s CFO commentary document, you will see we have added a table that shows consensus overstates rollover revenues by approximately $40 million versus the number we provided in March. That has an impact of overstating consensus EPS by $0.06. We hope you take this into consideration as you analyze our performance relative to consensus and to your model. Okay. With that housekeeping behind us, let\u2019s shift to the earnings release, to the Brokerage segment organic table on Page 3. All-in brokerage organic of 9.6%, we had a really strong finish to the quarter, some nice new business wins by the P&C team and a terrific finish by our benefits consulting teams. You will also see strong growth in both contingents and supplementals. The Ukraine-Russia conflict impact was small, about $5 million of revenue, which is about a $0.01 hit this quarter. Looking forward, it\u2019s looking like its small also, maybe another $5 million revenue impact spread over the next three quarters. Given our strong start and given our current favorable outlook of the market, as Pat discussed, we could be pushing nicely towards upper 8% to 9% full year organic growth here in \u201822. Next, let\u2019s turn to Page 5 to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Headline all-in adjusted margin expansion for first quarter was 49 basis points, right in line with our March IR Day expectation. Recall that expansion includes a favorable seasonal impact from reinsurance roll-in offset in part by a return of expenses that we come out of the pandemic and it also has a little more incentive compensation given our stronger first quarter organic growth and full year expectations. Repeating what we said during March, we are well positioned to deliver around 10 to 20 basis points of full year adjusted margin expansion. But remember, as we discussed here in \u201822, there will be margin change volatility quarter-to-quarter. That\u2019s due to expenses return as we come out of the pandemic and the roll-in impact of acquired reinsurance revenues. So, let me walk through what we said in March, 50 basis points of expansion here in the first quarter, then expecting second and third quarter margins to each be down around 100 basis points, but then that flips and we expect fourth quarter margins to be up around 100 basis points. The math, given that we are seasonally larger in the first quarter, gets us back to that 10 to 20 basis points of full year margin expansion. Looking way out towards \u201823 that quarterly margin change volatility should go away with the pandemic behind us and reinsurance fully in our books. Okay. Let\u2019s move on to the Risk Management segment and the organic table on the bottom of Page 5. You will see 15.2% organic in the first quarter. That\u2019s just terrific by the team. And with continued strong new business and rebounding claim counts, it\u2019s looking like organic revenue growth of about 10% each quarter for the rest of \u201822. On the next page, you will see that our Risk Management segment posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 17.3%. That was compressed by about 120 basis points due to an unusual late quarter litigation settlement. As Pat said, moving forward, we would expect margins for the remainder of \u201822 to be closer to 19%. Moving to Page 7 of the earnings release and the corporate segment shortcut table, most adjusted first quarter items were in line with our March IR Day estimates. Within the corporate line, we did also benefit from an FX remeasurement gain and a larger tax benefit related to employee stock option exercises given the strong performance of our stock late in the quarter. You also see a couple of non-GAAP adjustments. The first relates to transaction costs and professional fees associated with buying Willis Re. And the second was a state tax benefit related to the revaluation of our deferred income tax balances. Alright. Let\u2019s now go to the CFO commentary document. Page 3 has our typical brokerage and risk management modeling helpers. We have updated our outlook for integration. I will get to that more in a minute. We have updated FX and you will see a slight tick-up in our expected Brokerage segment tax rate, call it 0.5 percentage point. In addition, the amortization lines in both brokerage and risk management are now highlighted in yellow. This means the item is now being treated as a non-GAAP adjustment. If you missed our March IR Day, we did a vignette on how this change \u2013 on this change and how we are reporting adjusted EPS. This is the first quarter reporting under that revised method. On Page 4 of the CFO commentary, that\u2019s our corporate segment outlook. You will see there is no change in our outlook for second, third and fourth quarters. When you turn to Page 5 to clean energy, the purpose of this page is to highlight that we have over $1 billion of credit carry-forwards and we are now in the cash harvesting era of these investments. There is no GAAP earnings anymore other than a little bit of overhead expense, but rather now substantial cash flows. You will see in the pinkish column that the \u201822 cash flow increase should be substantial. We should be able to harvest $125 million to $150 million a year of cash flows and perhaps more in \u201823 and beyond, at that rate, a really nice 7-year cash flow sweetener. And there still is a possibility of an extension in the law, so we remain well positioned to restart production if that happens. Okay, flipping to Page 6 of the CFO commentary document. Top table is the rollover revenue table. Recall that we update this each earnings release day and also each quarter during our late quarter IR meetings. The next box, highlighted in yellow, is the math behind the $0.06 impact of consensus versus our March guidance that I touched on in my opening. Then at the bottom table is an update on our December Reinsurance acquisition. Revenue this quarter was $337 million and EBITDAC was $172 million. The very small difference to the numbers we provided during our March IR Day reflects two items: first, the quarterly timing related to further refinement in our ASC 606 accounting for both revenue and expense and second, some further movement in FX rates. In the end, if you go all the way back to our original August \u201821 projections, there is very little change to our first year of ownership expectations other than a small impact from Russia, Ukraine and FX. As for integration, the good news is that our original estimate of around a total of $250 million for integration charges through the end of 2024 is holding close. The even better news is we are making progress at a faster pace than we originally thought. Integration efforts around people, real estate, back office transition services, etcetera are targeted to be mostly done by late \u201822 versus mid to late \u201823 as originally planned. When it comes to technology rebuilds, we think most of it will be done by the end of \u201823 or early \u201824. So what that means is that we will see integration costs lumped more into \u201822 and \u201823, then spreading deep into \u201824. You will see the bump up of our \u201822 quarterly integration estimates back on Page 3 of the CFO commentary, but it\u2019s important to remember, it isn\u2019t changing our in-total view. So, that continues to be a really good story. As for cash, capital management and future M&A, at March 31, available cash on hand was about $450 million and no outstanding borrowing on our line of credit. With strong operating cash flows expected in \u201822 and a nice bump in cash flow from our clean energy investments, we are extremely well positioned to fund future tuck-in M&A using cash and debt. We continue to see our M&A capacity at more than $4 billion through the end of \u201823 without using any stock. So those are my comments. We\u2019re off to a great start in \u201822. From my vantage point as CFO, we\u2019re positioned for another great year. A huge thank you to the entire Gallagher team for another terrific quarter. Back to you, Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you, Doug. Darryl, I think we\u2019re ready to open up for questions, please.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first questions come from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\nPaul Newsome: Good morning. Good afternoon, Patrick. Congratulations on the quarter.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Paul.\nPaul Newsome: I was going to ask about the guidance for organic growth is at a decelerating pace. Maybe you could talk about sort of the factors that go into what might be decelerating prospectively from a macro basis that\u2019s having an effect on your business.\nDoug Howell: So listen, I think we posted 9.6% this quarter, and I think that we\u2019re guiding upper 8% to 9%. I wouldn\u2019t call that a deceleration. I think that there is a reality, looking towards where we were in third and fourth quarter, as the compares get a little more difficult to have. But I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d use the word deceleration, but I think it\u2019s pretty close.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, in fact, Paul, we looked at the stats before this call, and over the last eight quarters, the renewal rates across our book, including, I should add, the exposure units are about flat, around 8.5% to 9%. So I mean it varies up to 9%, 9.5%, it comes down to it. But I would say any kind of a wholesale drop-off is not what we\u2019re seeing, to Doug\u2019s point.\nPaul Newsome: Knock on wood, my second question relates to interest rates. We are finally seeing some rising interest rates. I was wondering what your thoughts are on how that affects your earnings as well as, frankly, M&A. I wonder if we\u2019re seeing any change in the competitive environment for M&A with interest rates changing as well. So I guess that\u2019s sneaking in essentially two questions.\nDoug Howell: Let me take the investment income for our fiduciary funds that we keep on hand. We would think that a 1 point rise in interest rates would be about another $40 million a year of investment income versus what we\u2019ve been showing so far. That might tick up a little bit more as we get reinsurance completely rolled into our books. In terms of what that means in terms of other pressures inside of our organization, we\u2019re just not all that sensitive to interest rates internally in our operating model.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: But we do know, Paul, I mean let\u2019s face it, a lot of the competition from our private equity competitors for acquisitions has been driven by free money. And if they got to start paying for it I think that bodes well for us.\nPaul Newsome: That makes sense. You haven\u2019t seen that \u2013 I see this as too soon with interest rate can...\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Cash, no, we haven\u2019t seen anything.\nPaul Newsome: Great, thanks guys. Appreciate the help.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is come from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi, Mark.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Hello, Pat. Good afternoon. Could you give the margin in brokerage, if you back out the Willis Re, I suppose you\u2019ve given us the inputs, but do you have that handy, Doug?\nDoug Howell: I can dig it out here for you here in a second.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: We\u2019ve got it at the table somewhere, Mark, do you have another question?\nMark Hughes: Yes. Pat, you talked about the risk management being helped by an uptick in GL property, workers\u2019 comp claims. Anything you see in either GL or comp that influences your view of what\u2019s going to happen in terms of the cycle, if, in fact, courts are opening and you\u2019re seeing a pickup in GL. Does that tell you anything?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: There is two things I\u2019d comment on, Mark, really. One is it\u2019s been in very interesting hard market. And as you know, looking over the past, what is now almost 4 years, comp hasn\u2019t moved. Comp has not been a big rate driver up and it\u2019s not coming down. So it\u2019s been an interesting line. And as the economy becomes more robust. And frankly, when we pick up \u2013 when we start to fill some of those 11 million jobs, I think the natural increase in claim activity is going to really benefit Gallagher Bassett. We clearly can track back that when our economy is humming, it\u2019s just a natural outcome. You don\u2019t like to see people get hurt, but we have more claim volume. That\u2019s number one. Number two, what I continue to be astounded by, and I\u2019m sure everybody on this call reads it every week as well, when I look at our social inflation around tort, it\u2019s incredible. And so I think what you\u2019re seeing is, number one, case settlements at levels that never any of us would have predicted but also what that does is it drives our clients to be much more cautious and concerned about claims that, frankly, in the past, they might have said, pay us $50,000, move on or let\u2019s not settle that. It doesn\u2019t look like that big a deal. I mean not to get anecdotal on you all, but it is late in the evening. And you probably saw the settlement last week for some guy who got $450,000 because this company threw a surprise party for him. I mean I keep asking the folks for a surprise party. But it\u2019s just \u2013 so that I do think is beneficial to GB. And GB continues to invest and I think capable of proving that if, in fact, you use our services, with all that we bring to the table, our outcomes are better. So all of a sudden, if you\u2019re used to getting a lot of claims, but one of them every 5 years tends to pop. And now you\u2019re looking at it, you go, man, what\u2019s happening? I\u2019m starting to get 2 a year, 3 a year. Now who pays those claims makes a bigger and bigger difference. And I think that bodes well for the long-term.\nDoug Howell: Mark, I can give you the answer on the \u2013 if you have a follow-up with that, then I\u2019ll come back to that.\nMark Hughes: Okay. I was just going to ask on the June 1 reinsurance renewals, so what kind of rate increases are you seeing, how much dislocation is there in the cat property.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Really not that much dislocation on the reinsurance side. And I would say, back to my prepared remarks, depending on the carrier, depending on the carriers experience. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the renewals. And Doug, go ahead.\nMark Hughes: Okay.\nDoug Howell: Yes. On the margin, Mark, we\u2019re somewhere around high 37% margins in the brokerage business without Willis Re. And there is some variability around that because of allocations between the units, right? Second of all, I just think that in the context of margin, as you\u2019re looking at what\u2019s changed since last year. This quarter, I know that we\u2019re ahead on our bonus accrual relative to where we were last year because we started off with considerably better organic growth. So that has a little bit of a margin compression impact, but I would consider that timing. We are in the first quarter. And recall, we give our raises out mid-year, so raise impact rolling in versus first quarter. As organic develops throughout the year, you grow into your raises and then when it comes back to cost returning into the business. So if you break it down, let\u2019s say that expenses year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis are $25 million up, $10 million of that\u2019s bonus. You probably can call it $6 million is raise impact and then you get down to about $8 million left over. That\u2019s probably \u2013 take third of that and call it increased professional fees that we\u2019re spending, third of that would be T&E travel and third of that would be client entertainment. So when you look at the pieces of being up, let\u2019s say, $25 million of expenses year-over-year, the way we look at it, call it, $10 million of it\u2019s timing and $15 million is spread between raises that we will work ourselves into for the year and then the other piece of it, T&E, entertainment and some professional fees. Does that help?\nMark Hughes: Yes. I appreciate the detail.\nDoug Howell: Sure. Yes. And let me throw in too is that we\u2019re \u2013 I went back while you were doing that. I looked at in first quarter of 2019, we posted 35%. And this is where the supplement really helps so that we post, not the CFO commentary but the 5-year supplement we put out there, we posted 35.6% EBITDAC margin in first quarter of \u201819. And this quarter in the Brokerage segment, we\u2019re at 39.8% so we\u2019re up 420 basis points. If we hit our target this year of being up 10 to 20 basis points for full year, we\u2019d be up 540 basis points over 2019. So it\u2019s 180 basis points of margin expansion a year over the last 3 years, each year, 180 basis points. And truly, our reinsurance business is rolling in. While seasonally a little better this quarter, when you put full year and it\u2019s not all that different than our combined brokerage operation margins. So the margin story we believe is pretty darn good. And when we\u2019re running somewhere around 34 points of margin for full year, if we hit our targets this year, that\u2019s pretty darn good versus the 28 and change in 2019.\nMark Hughes: Appreciate it.\nDoug Howell: Sure.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi, Greg.\nGreg Peters: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. I can say listening to your comments, Pat, that I\u2019m sure a number of us, myself included, would take a piece of the action on your surprise party. Keep us in mind. So I guess from a macro perspective, I\u2019m going to comment \u2013 Paul tried to ask a question, I\u2019m going to come at it from a different way. I know you\u2019ve mapped out a pretty robust outlook for the remainder of the year. There are a number of economists and other reports out there that are speculating about the potential oncoming over a recession. And obviously, the data is not showing it yet, at least your data isn\u2019t. But I\u2019m just curious from an enterprise risk management perspective. When you think about that type of risk, what are you doing at the corporate level to prepare for something like that, if you think that might be in the cards?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, first of all, Greg, I\u2019m not going to sit here and predict a recession. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve lived through them before. And I think we do know how to react to those. And when you\u2019re in a recession, a couple of things happen that are very, very negative. Exposure units drop, companies go broke, expenses become even more important, not that they are ever not important, and shopping can go up. Now when shopping goes up for our strength, in particular, in the middle market, I think we show well. So we hold our own there. But when you\u2019ve got a robust economy falling off, you end up with negative audits and you\u2019ve got lesser exposure units. And depending on the depth of that recession, it\u2019s not a pretty picture. So when you talk about what are we doing relative to our risk management approach, we talk about it every quarter. We take a look at where we are. We\u2019ve got significant margins, and we prepare to say here\u2019s what we have to do to make sure that \u2013 one of the things I really like about our model is we basically pay our production for us on how their book of business performs. So, we are all in this together and if the business is sinking. Now in previous recessions, if I don\u2019t go back too far, we\u2019ve not had the benefit of inflation. So inflation may, in fact, help cause a recession and I don\u2019t know whether that will be 1 point, 2 points. I know the first quarter GDP was down. But if you\u2019re talking 5% to 8% inflation, that has the exact opposite impact. As you know, payrolls go up. We are all seeing that. I mean, I can\u2019t go a day without somebody stopping me and saying we are getting whacked. I\u2019ve got a mid-level service person, and it\u2019s a problem and what am I going to do about it? And every customer is coming to Bill\u2019s or Bell\u2019s team and saying, how am I going to hold on to my people. Everybody wants them. They go to a restaurant. They don\u2019t have people that can serve you. I mean there is just huge demand, and that\u2019s pushing payrolls up. And our contractors book, they bid everything out and now they got to deliver at inflation rates they never anticipated when they made the bid. Well, if there is other business to bid, those rates are going up. So sales will go up. So there is offsetting factors there. And I think our business holds up pretty darn well in a recession.\nDoug Howell: Yes, so a couple of things. We look at daily endorsements, cancellations, audits, we get that as a daily feed. And this was the biggest month of positive audits that we\u2019ve seen. And again, that\u2019s historical. That\u2019s a rearview mirror metric, but I\u2019m not seeing that trail off at all. So I\u2019m not seeing any early signs of a recession to happen because the first thing a customer will do is they\u2019ll ring up the phone and they\u2019ll adjust their expected payrolls down. So we\u2019re not seeing that. We\u2019re not seeing it in our exposure unit and our rate monitoring the deal. We look at renewals every day also. So we\u2019re just not seeing it happen. But what we\u2019ve proven throughout the COVID is that we\u2019ve got a pretty resilient model that we have a lot of levers to pull should we get into a situation where growth becomes more difficult. And I think that we\u2019ve proven we can do that. So we think the model is resilient. We think that inflation is going to help us on the top line when it comes to revenues for the business that\u2019s there. But we do have levers that we can pull in order to help us get through a recession.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: And also, let me remind you, back in 2007, \u201808, \u201809, and this is just an incredible support of this model again. You\u2019d think oh, my gosh, it\u2019s going to be our clients will stop paying their people before they stop paying their insurance bill. That\u2019s how important we are to them. That\u2019s a good spot to be.\nGreg Peters: Indeed. Thanks color on that. Pivot to perhaps a little bit more detailed question and Doug, your guidance and commentary on the various parts in your CFO commentary quite helpful. And I guess what I wanted to ask about was the free cash flow, excluding clean energy because you talked about the integration expense and some other things. I\u2019m just wondering what you think the cadence of that looks like now for \u201822. Has there been a change versus previous expectations? And how you would suggest we look at that?\nDoug Howell: Let\u2019s see if I can break it down. Let\u2019s start with $4 billion that we have left over for M&A in \u201822 and \u201823. Cash \u2013 clean energy provides $250 million of that. Integration is already net in that number, right? So I\u2019ve already given you a number net of integration. Also, when we talk about integration, you\u2019ve got to look at it as half of it being noncash and half of it being cash. You recall that integration expenses are the sign-up bonuses that we delivered and mostly equity plans, so that\u2019s amortizing as a noncash item against that. So I would say that integration won\u2019t consume an excessive amount of cash. I would say that the clean energy \u2013 maybe you think about it this way, the clean energy basically offsets the cash portion of that. And all that is all washed out in our $4 billion expectation for M&A over the \u2013 during \u201822 and \u201823. Does that help you give a thought on it?\nGreg Peters: It does. I know you\u2019ve given me similar answers like that in the past. It feels like that should be your voice mail, but thanks for reminding me of all that little pieces there.\nDoug Howell: Listen, it generates a lot of cash. It\u2019s like I say around here, I don\u2019t make the money, I just count it and there is a lot of it coming in.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thanks, guys for the answers.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our next question is come from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi, Elyse.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening. Maybe my first question is kind of going back to the earlier discussion on organic. Pat, when you gave us the initial outlook for 2022, you had said that the full year would be about 1% above the Q1. So is it just that the \u2013 and I think that was maybe based off of the benefits business perhaps being a little lighter and heavier in concentration in the Q1. But is there something that changed? Or is there just \u2013 I understand that the rest of the year outlook is close to the Q1. Is there something that perhaps caused that view to change? Or is it just that just as simple as the Q1 being better than you expected when you made that comment?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I\u2019ll let Doug answer the actual number piece on that because a lot of that\u2019s mathematical. But in terms of what I\u2019m seeing for the year, I\u2019m not seeing \u2013 I\u2019m not anticipating significant change in the operating environment over the next three quarters.\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think that our cautious guidance in January and then again in March really was talking about the fact that we\u2019re not getting rate lift from workers\u2019 comp, which is heavier in the first quarter. And then also, you\u2019re not really seeing rate and benefits yet now it\u2019s interesting since that guidance there is medical inflation that\u2019s coming back fast and furious. And I think that give us another quarter on that, and we might become a little bit more bullish because I think that \u2013 and of course, that will eventually translate into workers\u2019 comp too, absent of any frequency declining or holding in there. But I think our cautiousness on the benefits business might have been overly cautious. But again, we just need to see another quarter of that before we get into a position of declaring that there is true medical inflation that\u2019s going to affect next year\u2019s growth, too. But I don\u2019t see it as a headwind. I see it as a tailwind to our organic.\nElyse Greenspan: Great. And then my second question, you guys have mentioned having around $4 billion of capital over the next couple of years to spend on M&A. The tuck-ins, right, were just around $30 million this quarter, so maybe a little bit light relative to some historical averages. So as we think about just kind of deal flows, it sounds like interest rates could impact private equity interest, so maybe that helps with the pipeline. Is there a certain point and maybe we have to wait until next year where if deals don\u2019t materialize since that\u2019s a pretty high level of capital, Gallagher might consider using some buybacks as well with the excess capital?\nDoug Howell: I think an answer to that is \u2013 yes, let\u2019s clarify. I think that first quarter is already seasonally the smallest when it comes to M&A. It\u2019s historically been that 5 years out of the last 6 years. So, I think there is just a natural little push towards year-end and then there is a little pause in the first quarter. So, I think there could be a rebound in opportunities through the rest of the year. If those rebounds don\u2019t materialize and we are not seeing opportunities for it, then our next place that we would go is to make sure that our debt is clearly within an a solid investment-grade rating and then use it for stock buybacks next and then maybe even consideration on the dividend. So, those are the three or four things that we are seeing how is deal flow look, next thing is what do we do with the excess cash as the deal flow isn\u2019t there, and we will stack that up to controlling the debt, for sure, then making sure that we are positioned well to buy back stock or do dividend increases.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And one last one on Willis Re, I recognize the revenue was close to what you guys had laid out at the Investor Day. Can you give us a sense of just client retention and new business and how that\u2019s been trending in your first full quarter of owning the business?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes. I will do that, Lisa. It\u2019s really been an amazing and let\u2019s remember, as we finished the quarter, we are four months in. So, as we have this call, we are close to five months. But I will tell you that the team, we are not losing people, we are not losing clients. Our renewals have been fantastic. Tom, myself, others at the table have had a chance to meet with reinsurance clients. They continue to be very open about the fact that they are glad. That they are \u2013 there is not one less competitor in the marketplace. They are also very clear with us that the reason that the business held together over the years of discussion as to where this business was going to land was because of the people handling their business. And those people are still in place. Our losses in terms of people out the door are minimal to zero. And so when I look at it, I am really, really happy about it. And new business pipeline is strong. What I am very excited about is the integration that we are seeing or the sharing of information from our retail. Everybody said at the beginning, why is this good for retail. And people also would ask, why does reinsurance care what you are doing as a retailer. Well, I will tell you what. There is so much going back and forth right now in terms of data relative to the business we are doing with all kinds of carriers, with things that our reinsurance people are seeing can help our retailers and they are melding. So, the business is strong. We are absolutely nailing it when it comes to what we hope the performer would be and I think it\u2019s going to continue to be a great business for us.\nDoug Howell: Yes, I can give you some numbers behind that flavor is that \u2013 and I will give it to you is net new. Our net new was over 5% this quarter, if you control for those people that put on a different jersey before we bought it. And our overall organic is nicely, let\u2019s call it, 8% first quarter plus or minus a point. So organic, really I got to give it to the team for what they went through for 3 years for them to be out there battling the way to have holding their clients, writing new business, I mean it\u2019s really a terrific story. So, when you are posting organic nicely in that upper-single digits after what they have been through, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the team.\nElyse Greenspan: Great. Thanks for all the color.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks Elyse.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. Please proceed with your questions.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi David.\nDavid Motemaden: Hi. Good evening. How is it going guys?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Great.\nDavid Motemaden: So, great to hear the outlook on organic in the Brokerage segment, but obviously still keeping the 10 basis points to 20 basis points full year margin expansion outlook. I guess I am wondering, it definitely sounds like it\u2019s a bit more positive on the organic growth side. So, I guess I am wondering why I guess we are not expecting or why you guys aren\u2019t expecting more margin improvement than the 10 basis points to 20 basis points. Is it additional investments that you are making? Is it the bonus accruals? Is it something in addition, I think you had called out $60 million of incremental costs coming back in this year. Is that higher now that sort of keeps it at 10 basis points to 20 basis points of margin expansion?\nDoug Howell: Yes. I think that we are just a little reluctant right now to push that up when it really comes down to it. I think that there is a lot of things that we would really like to do. And I will segue into some of the exciting stuff. When you look at what\u2019s going on with \u2013 and you listen to our March, our late quarter IR Day. We talk about all the great things we are doing in the business. When you look at what\u2019s going on with our electronic delivery platform, when you are looking at the automation that we are doing that we are writing 6,000 policies a month with hardly anybody involved on cyber, the Gallagher Drive, the Advantage program, the smart market. And then you look at the advertising and the brand building that we are doing and spending money on that systems. We are spending money on hardening the environment and delivering more point-of-sale capabilities to the sales force. When you look at all those things, posting another 10 basis points, 20 basis points, 30 basis points of margin expansion on top of already posting 540 basis points of expansion since 2019, we would just like to spend a little money this year. When you get to 2023, as a lot of this levelizes between the pandemic and between \u2013 and the roll-in of the reinsurance M&A, you might see a little bit more expansion in that if we are still posting in that 9% range. But right now, this is a great opportunity for us to invest in the future organic growth of the company. So, that\u2019s where we are on it. You want to call that voluntary spend, call it, voluntary spend, but it\u2019s not must spend.\nDavid Motemaden: No, it makes sense. No, that makes sense. And I guess just maybe it sounded like the international business did quite well in the first quarter. So, I guess I am wondering, Pat, just specifically, could you just talk about what you are seeing on the ground in Europe and in the UK, if there is any sign of any wobbles there in terms of exposure growth or demand as I think some of the leading indicators are pointing towards economic slowdown there?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, let me go around the world again as I did in my prepared remarks. So, if you take a look at what we are seeing in Canada. And it\u2019s \u2013 our team in terms of new business is on fire. When we closed on Neuraxis years ago and the Canadian economy was a little flush where it was a little slow. We weren\u2019t together. Neuraxis has seven separate businesses kind of operating separately. Now that business is totally together. The Gallagher branding is working extremely well. People are pumped up. We are using sales force. Our pipeline has grown and the 10% organic, yes, it\u2019s helped by rate, but new business is much better than it\u2019s ever been. When you go to the UK, that same timeframe, we have added new \u2013 recall, we bought Heath Lambert, Giles, etcetera, again, a lot of time on integration. Today, we will do an acquisition of size in the UK. And frankly, we have got that thing integrated in five months to seven months. And they are putting on a Gallagher jersey. They are excited about it. Then our team just gets stronger and stronger there. Now, I can\u2019t tell you that economic events aren\u2019t going to impact us. Recessions are terrible. Bad for our clients, they are bad for us, and they are bad for our business. But I would tell you that where we are from a team perspective is fantastic. So, you are right to look through the numbers and say it seems like international is doing really well because as we walked around the world and told you the organic, they are just killing it everywhere. Latin America is strong. New Zealand is strong. Australia is strong, and all of that is not just rate driven. That\u2019s the thing I want to make sure everybody realizes is that it\u2019s not just because rates are moving, we are getting our fair share of our new business opportunities. And in fact, we are seeing hit ratios improve and we are being helped by our clients\u2019 business expansions and just blocking and tackling. So, it\u2019s a very good spot to be.\nDoug Howell: Yes. I can\u2019t predict the trickle-on effect. But remember, we are primarily in the UK. We do have inflow from the rest of Europe. Not heavily based in by any means in Eastern Europe. So, we don\u2019t have that. And I think at one point, we looked at and our inflows from Europe might have been in that $40 million range in total revenues. So, if you think about it in the context of what it means to Gallagher, if all of Europe would stop sending any business to London, it\u2019s $50 million of lost revenue to us. And pushing $8 billion of revenue as a total organization, we would feel it, but it wouldn\u2019t register at all.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: David, I think it\u2019s fair to say, too, what we have done in the United States in terms of the things you have seen in your SmartMarket, Gallagher Drive. Those things are impacting our new business with carriers, our retention and clearly, our new business hit ratios using SmartMarket, and we are taking those internationally now. So, that was born and bred here in the U.S. But those are our products that are going to be available in Canada and the UK to start. And they are difference makers. And really remember, when we compete and this is one of the things about again, kind of being in a lucky spot. 90% of the time when our people go out the door to compete, we are competing with somebody smaller. Say at 10%, 11%, 12% of the time, we are competing with folks that, frankly, can come to the table with the same type of resources or story. But every other time, when I talk to our sales force, I think we should win. We don\u2019t, obviously, but I think that\u2019s having an impact. Our people go out the door thinking they are going to win, I will tell you that.\nDavid Motemaden: Yes, it definitely looks like you guys are getting your fair share of wins. And I know in the past, you have broken out the brokerage organic in terms of drivers by exposure, pricing and net new. I think in the past, you said it\u2019s about a third, a third, a third, has that changed at all this quarter?\nDoug Howell: Well, I think rates might be fueling that just a little bit more, but we probably need a little more time to peel that apart. We will see if I can give you something, and get back together in June on that. But right now, rates probably used to be a third, a third, a third, and I think rates might be more 40% than, 30%, 30%, something like that.\nDavid Motemaden: Yes. Okay. Great. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your questions.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Hi guys. I hope all is well. One, I guess dumb question. When I look at Page 3 of the CFO commentary, it still anticipates a full year margin of 19% in risk management. Is that \u2013 does that mean that we are going to unwind some of the first quarter underperformance, or is that assuming \u2013 is that based on like the $18.5 million?\nDoug Howell: I think we will be somewhere nicely in the 18% for full year. So, I think that if we post three quarters of 19%, we will claw back into that $17.3 million for this quarter. And again, we get an unusual legal settlement probably once every 4 years, 5 years. So, it\u2019s unfortunate it happened this quarter, but that business is really doing well.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. A second issue, and I know these are small numbers, but does the call it withdrawal from Russia on the reinsurance business, does that have any impact on the earn-out?\nDoug Howell: Yes. I would technically have an impact. If we don\u2019t reach some of our milestones in it, that loss of $10 million over the course of the year, yes that might have a \u2013 it would have an impact on it.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: They are going to overdo that. That\u2019s not \u2013 my prediction is it will not.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Because of other businesses compensating?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Correct.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And then one final question on the reinsurance side and Pat, you talked a lot about the fact that some of the people there were under some strain over the past couple of years. Did that depress what Willis Re was able to charge? Is there an opportunity for revenue growth now that simply because it\u2019s a more stable platform or you can invest in it more heavily?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I got to understand the question. I mean our reinsurance clients pay us very, very, very well and very fairly and now a stable environment is not going to give us the ability to charge our clients. Does it give us the ability to invest more favorably, absolutely, because you now have people and our old business is people. To be perfectly blunt, there were people who were going to join them before, like join them in the middle of a sale. Nobody knows \u2013 by the way, remember, I am not making this up, it was public. I mean they couldn\u2019t tell the people at Willis where they are going to sit, who are they going to work for. That\u2019s not easy to recruit into, is it. Well, there is lots of opportunities to invest. There is lots of \u2013 at the same time, reinsurance buyers are kind of frozen in the headlights. We want to see competition in the market. We don\u2019t want Willis, frankly, to disappear, but we are not going to build the problem bigger. So, yes, there is opportunities for us to go back to those clients and say, \u201cHey, we think we have got something to tell you now.\u201d So, I think once it settles down and we all get \u2013 again, I am four months into the quarter, five months in total, a year from now I will have a much better feel for the individuals.\nDoug Howell: I will add to it, though the thirst for information from our reinsurance partners is there. And if we can bring them the information that they are looking for that maybe they haven\u2019t been able to get in the past. I believe that, that will help them attract more new clients and perhaps broaden out the book of business they are doing with their existing clients. I do believe that our ability to provide real-time data like we do for our retail business to them, a compelling advantage for them in the marketplace.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. That is very helpful. Thank you so much.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks Meyer.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final questions come from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nWeston Bloomer: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. My first was a follow-up on the investments that you guys described around the systems and point of sales. I guess what\u2019s the pipeline and timing for that? Does that extend into 2023? And just curious because in 2023, can we go back to a world where the pre-pandemic commentary was we expand margins if organic is over 4%? Is that baseline potentially still the same, or could it be lower given the higher investments that you are making? Recognizing that the 34% and 19% margins are still impressive, but curious how to think about that in 2023?\nDoug Howell: Well, one of the things I would like to say about it is that we have been investing in these technologies all along the way. So, we are talking about investing in another $3 million or $4 million or $5 million a quarter. I mean this is a smart market advantage, better works 360, all the things that we are doing, we are continuing to invest in them, and we really didn\u2019t slow that down much. It\u2019s the incremental spend on them to make them even better and more competitive. That\u2019s what we want to do. I mean if you looked at our GB go, I am just talking in the risk management right now, what they can do to adjust a claim on your phone with you, track it, monitor it, help you get back to work, it\u2019s impressive. So, these are the type of enhancements that we have on the table how do we make that better, how do we make Gallagher Drive better. Right now, RPS has 24 different products on their quote and buying system that\u2019s basically a no-touch system. They are doing 6,000 policies a month. What happens when we took that out to 48 policies and our investment spend on that illustratively is about $2 million a year. But what if we get 48 different lines of cover on that and then go to 72 and then go to 100? It\u2019s \u2013 those are the type of incremental investments that we would like to make because I think they are powerful. I say this all the time, what we are doing on the RPS automation side alone is a $1 billion business. And I think we would like to do that across 20 different things inside of the company. So, where our margin is going to be in \u201823, we are going to \u2013 I think that we are going to be over the return of expenses from the pandemic. The real question is how much are we going to spend on investment on that. But it would stand to reason that if we post at least 4% organic growth, there will be opportunities to expand on that.\nWeston Bloomer: Got it. That\u2019s helpful color. And then my second question is a follow-up to Elyse\u2019s on M&A. I just want to clarify. Was all of the term sheet disclosure \u2013 is all of that seasonal, or is there any of that strategic around Willis Re? The reason I am asking is I am trying to frame the potential for maybe a pickup in that number in the second half as you annualized the deal?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: The numbers we were talking about in the pipeline in our prepared remarks are totally outside of Willis Re. Willis Re is done, those are\u2026\nWeston Bloomer: What I meant is, yes, is the pipeline potentially lighter as you focus on integrating Willis Re?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No. Our retail operations have zero distraction by the Willis Re folks.\nDoug Howell: And actually, we are starting to see some small little boutique reinsurance opportunities pipe up on our deals already.\nWeston Bloomer: Okay. That\u2019s great to hear. Thank you.\nDoug Howell: Thanks Weston.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks Weston. Darryl, I think that\u2019s all our questions for tonight. So, I would like to just say thank you again for joining us. Obviously, we had a fantastic start to 2022. I would like to thank our colleagues around the globe for their hard work. We are a people business and our results directly reflect your efforts. Thank you. We look forward to speaking with you again at our June Investor Day, and thanks for being with us, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.",

Today, I will get to my typical comments on organic margins, clean energy, cash, etcetera and I will also do a financial recap of the Willis Re acquisition, but first, the modeling heads-up regarding rollover revenues this quarter. We typically don't comment on consensus estimates, but this quarter looks like there is a large variance in brokerage segment rollover revenues relative to the guidance numbers we provided within our CFO commentary document during our March 16 IR Day. When we get to Page 6 of today's CFO commentary document, you will see we have added a table that shows consensus overstates rollover revenues by approximately $40 million versus the number we provided in March. That has an impact of overstating consensus EPS by $0.06. We hope you take this into consideration as you analyze our performance relative to consensus and to your model. Okay. With that housekeeping behind us, let's shift to the earnings release, to the Brokerage segment organic table on Page 3. All-in brokerage organic of 9.6%, we had a really strong finish to the quarter, some nice new business wins by the P&C team and a terrific finish by our benefits consulting teams. You will also see strong growth in both contingents and supplementals. The Ukraine-Russia conflict impact was small, about $5 million of revenue, which is about a $0.01 hit this quarter. Looking forward, it's looking like its small also, maybe another $5 million revenue impact spread over the next three quarters. Given our strong start and given our current favorable outlook of the market, as Pat discussed, we could be pushing nicely towards upper 8% to 9% full year organic growth here in \u201822. Next, let's turn to Page 5 to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC margin table. Headline all-in adjusted margin expansion for first quarter was 49 basis points, right in line with our March IR Day expectation. Recall that expansion includes a favorable seasonal impact from reinsurance roll-in offset in part by a return of expenses that we come out of the pandemic and it also has a little more incentive compensation given our stronger first quarter organic growth and full year expectations. Repeating what we said during March, we are well positioned to deliver around 10 to 20 basis points of full year adjusted margin expansion. But remember, as we discussed here in \u201822, there will be margin change volatility quarter-to-quarter. That's due to expenses return as we come out of the pandemic and the roll-in impact of acquired reinsurance revenues. So, let me walk through what we said in March, 50 basis points of expansion here in the first quarter, then expecting second and third quarter margins to each be down around 100 basis points, but then that flips and we expect fourth quarter margins to be up around 100 basis points. The math, given that we are seasonally larger in the first quarter, gets us back to that 10 to 20 basis points of full year margin expansion. Looking way out towards \u201823 that quarterly margin change volatility should go away with the pandemic behind us and reinsurance fully in our books. Okay. Let's move on to the Risk Management segment and the organic table on the bottom of Page 5. You will see 15.2% organic in the first quarter. That's just terrific by the team. And with continued strong new business and rebounding claim counts, it's looking like organic revenue growth of about 10% each quarter for the rest of \u201822. On the next page, you will see that our Risk Management segment posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 17.3%. That was compressed by about 120 basis points due to an unusual late quarter litigation settlement. As Pat said, moving forward, we would expect margins for the remainder of \u201822 to be closer to 19%. Moving to Page 7 of the earnings release and the corporate segment shortcut table, most adjusted first quarter items were in line with our March IR Day estimates. Within the corporate line, we did also benefit from an FX remeasurement gain and a larger tax benefit related to employee stock option exercises given the strong performance of our stock late in the quarter. You also see a couple of non-GAAP adjustments. The first relates to transaction costs and professional fees associated with buying Willis Re. And the second was a state tax benefit related to the revaluation of our deferred income tax balances. Alright. Let's now go to the CFO commentary document. Page 3 has our typical brokerage and risk management modeling helpers. We have updated our outlook for integration. I will get to that more in a minute. We have updated FX and you will see a slight tick-up in our expected Brokerage segment tax rate, call it 0.5 percentage point. In addition, the amortization lines in both brokerage and risk management are now highlighted in yellow. This means the item is now being treated as a non-GAAP adjustment. If you missed our March IR Day, we did a vignette on how this change \u2013 on this change and how we are reporting adjusted EPS. This is the first quarter reporting under that revised method. On Page 4 of the CFO commentary, that's our corporate segment outlook. You will see there is no change in our outlook for second, third and fourth quarters. When you turn to Page 5 to clean energy, the purpose of this page is to highlight that we have over $1 billion of credit carry-forwards and we are now in the cash harvesting era of these investments. There is no GAAP earnings anymore other than a little bit of overhead expense, but rather now substantial cash flows. You will see in the pinkish column that the \u201822 cash flow increase should be substantial. We should be able to harvest $125 million to $150 million a year of cash flows and perhaps more in \u201823 and beyond, at that rate, a really nice 7-year cash flow sweetener. And there still is a possibility of an extension in the law, so we remain well positioned to restart production if that happens. Okay, flipping to Page 6 of the CFO commentary document. Top table is the rollover revenue table. Recall that we update this each earnings release day and also each quarter during our late quarter IR meetings. The next box, highlighted in yellow, is the math behind the $0.06 impact of consensus versus our March guidance that I touched on in my opening. Then at the bottom table is an update on our December Reinsurance acquisition. Revenue this quarter was $337 million and EBITDAC was $172 million. The very small difference to the numbers we provided during our March IR Day reflects two items: first, the quarterly timing related to further refinement in our ASC 606 accounting for both revenue and expense and second, some further movement in FX rates. In the end, if you go all the way back to our original August \u201821 projections, there is very little change to our first year of ownership expectations other than a small impact from Russia, Ukraine and FX. As for integration, the good news is that our original estimate of around a total of $250 million for integration charges through the end of 2024 is holding close. The even better news is we are making progress at a faster pace than we originally thought. Integration efforts around people, real estate, back office transition services, etcetera are targeted to be mostly done by late \u201822 versus mid to late \u201823 as originally planned. When it comes to technology rebuilds, we think most of it will be done by the end of \u201823 or early \u201824. So what that means is that we will see integration costs lumped more into \u201822 and \u201823, then spreading deep into \u201824. You will see the bump up of our \u201822 quarterly integration estimates back on Page 3 of the CFO commentary, but it's important to remember, it isn't changing our in-total view. So, that continues to be a really good story. As for cash, capital management and future M&A, at March 31, available cash on hand was about $450 million and no outstanding borrowing on our line of credit. With strong operating cash flows expected in \u201822 and a nice bump in cash flow from our clean energy investments, we are extremely well positioned to fund future tuck-in M&A using cash and debt. We continue to see our M&A capacity at more than $4 billion through the end of \u201823 without using any stock. So those are my comments. We're off to a great start in \u201822. From my vantage point as CFO, we're positioned for another great year. A huge thank you to the entire Gallagher team for another terrific quarter. Back to you, Pat. So listen, I think we posted 9.6% this quarter, and I think that we're guiding upper 8% to 9%. I wouldn't call that a deceleration. I think that there is a reality, looking towards where we were in third and fourth quarter, as the compares get a little more difficult to have. But I don't know if I'd use the word deceleration, but I think it's pretty close. Let me take the investment income for our fiduciary funds that we keep on hand. We would think that a 1 point rise in interest rates would be about another $40 million a year of investment income versus what we've been showing so far. That might tick up a little bit more as we get reinsurance completely rolled into our books. In terms of what that means in terms of other pressures inside of our organization, we're just not all that sensitive to interest rates internally in our operating model. I can dig it out here for you here in a second. Mark, I can give you the answer on the \u2013 if you have a follow-up with that, then I'll come back to that. Yes. On the margin, Mark, we're somewhere around high 37% margins in the brokerage business without Willis Re. And there is some variability around that because of allocations between the units, right? Second of all, I just think that in the context of margin, as you're looking at what's changed since last year. This quarter, I know that we're ahead on our bonus accrual relative to where we were last year because we started off with considerably better organic growth. So that has a little bit of a margin compression impact, but I would consider that timing. We are in the first quarter. And recall, we give our raises out mid-year, so raise impact rolling in versus first quarter. As organic develops throughout the year, you grow into your raises and then when it comes back to cost returning into the business. So if you break it down, let's say that expenses year-over-year on an apples-to-apples basis are $25 million up, $10 million of that's bonus. You probably can call it $6 million is raise impact and then you get down to about $8 million left over. That's probably \u2013 take third of that and call it increased professional fees that we're spending, third of that would be T&E travel and third of that would be client entertainment. So when you look at the pieces of being up, let's say, $25 million of expenses year-over-year, the way we look at it, call it, $10 million of it's timing and $15 million is spread between raises that we will work ourselves into for the year and then the other piece of it, T&E, entertainment and some professional fees. Does that help? Sure. Yes. And let me throw in too is that we're \u2013 I went back while you were doing that. I looked at in first quarter of 2019, we posted 35%. And this is where the supplement really helps so that we post, not the CFO commentary but the 5-year supplement we put out there, we posted 35.6% EBITDAC margin in first quarter of \u201819. And this quarter in the Brokerage segment, we're at 39.8% so we're up 420 basis points. If we hit our target this year of being up 10 to 20 basis points for full year, we'd be up 540 basis points over 2019. So it's 180 basis points of margin expansion a year over the last 3 years, each year, 180 basis points. And truly, our reinsurance business is rolling in. While seasonally a little better this quarter, when you put full year and it's not all that different than our combined brokerage operation margins. So the margin story we believe is pretty darn good. And when we're running somewhere around 34 points of margin for full year, if we hit our targets this year, that's pretty darn good versus the 28 and change in 2019. Sure. Yes, so a couple of things. We look at daily endorsements, cancellations, audits, we get that as a daily feed. And this was the biggest month of positive audits that we've seen. And again, that's historical. That's a rearview mirror metric, but I'm not seeing that trail off at all. So I'm not seeing any early signs of a recession to happen because the first thing a customer will do is they'll ring up the phone and they'll adjust their expected payrolls down. So we're not seeing that. We're not seeing it in our exposure unit and our rate monitoring the deal. We look at renewals every day also. So we're just not seeing it happen. But what we've proven throughout the COVID is that we've got a pretty resilient model that we have a lot of levers to pull should we get into a situation where growth becomes more difficult. And I think that we've proven we can do that. So we think the model is resilient. We think that inflation is going to help us on the top line when it comes to revenues for the business that's there. But we do have levers that we can pull in order to help us get through a recession. Let's see if I can break it down. Let's start with $4 billion that we have left over for M&A in \u201822 and \u201823. Cash \u2013 clean energy provides $250 million of that. Integration is already net in that number, right? So I've already given you a number net of integration. Also, when we talk about integration, you've got to look at it as half of it being noncash and half of it being cash. You recall that integration expenses are the sign-up bonuses that we delivered and mostly equity plans, so that's amortizing as a noncash item against that. So I would say that integration won't consume an excessive amount of cash. I would say that the clean energy \u2013 maybe you think about it this way, the clean energy basically offsets the cash portion of that. And all that is all washed out in our $4 billion expectation for M&A over the \u2013 during \u201822 and \u201823. Does that help you give a thought on it? Listen, it generates a lot of cash. It's like I say around here, I don't make the money, I just count it and there is a lot of it coming in. Yes. I think that our cautious guidance in January and then again in March really was talking about the fact that we're not getting rate lift from workers' comp, which is heavier in the first quarter. And then also, you're not really seeing rate and benefits yet now it's interesting since that guidance there is medical inflation that's coming back fast and furious. And I think that give us another quarter on that, and we might become a little bit more bullish because I think that \u2013 and of course, that will eventually translate into workers' comp too, absent of any frequency declining or holding in there. But I think our cautiousness on the benefits business might have been overly cautious. But again, we just need to see another quarter of that before we get into a position of declaring that there is true medical inflation that's going to affect next year's growth, too. But I don't see it as a headwind. I see it as a tailwind to our organic. I think an answer to that is \u2013 yes, let's clarify. I think that first quarter is already seasonally the smallest when it comes to M&A. It's historically been that 5 years out of the last 6 years. So, I think there is just a natural little push towards year-end and then there is a little pause in the first quarter. So, I think there could be a rebound in opportunities through the rest of the year. If those rebounds don't materialize and we are not seeing opportunities for it, then our next place that we would go is to make sure that our debt is clearly within an a solid investment-grade rating and then use it for stock buybacks next and then maybe even consideration on the dividend. So, those are the three or four things that we are seeing how is deal flow look, next thing is what do we do with the excess cash as the deal flow isn't there, and we will stack that up to controlling the debt, for sure, then making sure that we are positioned well to buy back stock or do dividend increases. Yes, I can give you some numbers behind that flavor is that \u2013 and I will give it to you is net new. Our net new was over 5% this quarter, if you control for those people that put on a different jersey before we bought it. And our overall organic is nicely, let's call it, 8% first quarter plus or minus a point. So organic, really I got to give it to the team for what they went through for 3 years for them to be out there battling the way to have holding their clients, writing new business, I mean it's really a terrific story. So, when you are posting organic nicely in that upper-single digits after what they have been through, I couldn't be more pleased with the team. Yes. I think that we are just a little reluctant right now to push that up when it really comes down to it. I think that there is a lot of things that we would really like to do. And I will segue into some of the exciting stuff. When you look at what's going on with \u2013 and you listen to our March, our late quarter IR Day. We talk about all the great things we are doing in the business. When you look at what's going on with our electronic delivery platform, when you are looking at the automation that we are doing that we are writing 6,000 policies a month with hardly anybody involved on cyber, the Gallagher Drive, the Advantage program, the smart market. And then you look at the advertising and the brand building that we are doing and spending money on that systems. We are spending money on hardening the environment and delivering more point-of-sale capabilities to the sales force. When you look at all those things, posting another 10 basis points, 20 basis points, 30 basis points of margin expansion on top of already posting 540 basis points of expansion since 2019, we would just like to spend a little money this year. When you get to 2023, as a lot of this levelizes between the pandemic and between \u2013 and the roll-in of the reinsurance M&A, you might see a little bit more expansion in that if we are still posting in that 9% range. But right now, this is a great opportunity for us to invest in the future organic growth of the company. So, that's where we are on it. You want to call that voluntary spend, call it, voluntary spend, but it's not must spend. Yes. I can't predict the trickle-on effect. But remember, we are primarily in the UK. We do have inflow from the rest of Europe. Not heavily based in by any means in Eastern Europe. So, we don't have that. And I think at one point, we looked at and our inflows from Europe might have been in that $40 million range in total revenues. So, if you think about it in the context of what it means to Gallagher, if all of Europe would stop sending any business to London, it's $50 million of lost revenue to us. And pushing $8 billion of revenue as a total organization, we would feel it, but it wouldn't register at all. Well, I think rates might be fueling that just a little bit more, but we probably need a little more time to peel that apart. We will see if I can give you something, and get back together in June on that. But right now, rates probably used to be a third, a third, a third, and I think rates might be more 40% than, 30%, 30%, something like that. I think we will be somewhere nicely in the 18% for full year. So, I think that if we post three quarters of 19%, we will claw back into that $17.3 million for this quarter. And again, we get an unusual legal settlement probably once every 4 years, 5 years. So, it's unfortunate it happened this quarter, but that business is really doing well. Yes. I would technically have an impact. If we don't reach some of our milestones in it, that loss of $10 million over the course of the year, yes that might have a \u2013 it would have an impact on it. I will add to it, though the thirst for information from our reinsurance partners is there. And if we can bring them the information that they are looking for that maybe they haven't been able to get in the past. I believe that, that will help them attract more new clients and perhaps broaden out the book of business they are doing with their existing clients. I do believe that our ability to provide real-time data like we do for our retail business to them, a compelling advantage for them in the marketplace. Well, one of the things I would like to say about it is that we have been investing in these technologies all along the way. So, we are talking about investing in another $3 million or $4 million or $5 million a quarter. I mean this is a smart market advantage, better works 360, all the things that we are doing, we are continuing to invest in them, and we really didn't slow that down much. It's the incremental spend on them to make them even better and more competitive. That's what we want to do. I mean if you looked at our GB go, I am just talking in the risk management right now, what they can do to adjust a claim on your phone with you, track it, monitor it, help you get back to work, it's impressive. So, these are the type of enhancements that we have on the table how do we make that better, how do we make Gallagher Drive better. Right now, RPS has 24 different products on their quote and buying system that's basically a no-touch system. They are doing 6,000 policies a month. What happens when we took that out to 48 policies and our investment spend on that illustratively is about $2 million a year. But what if we get 48 different lines of cover on that and then go to 72 and then go to 100? It's \u2013 those are the type of incremental investments that we would like to make because I think they are powerful. I say this all the time, what we are doing on the RPS automation side alone is a $1 billion business. And I think we would like to do that across 20 different things inside of the company. So, where our margin is going to be in \u201823, we are going to \u2013 I think that we are going to be over the return of expenses from the pandemic. The real question is how much are we going to spend on investment on that. But it would stand to reason that if we post at least 4% organic growth, there will be opportunities to expand on that. And actually, we are starting to see some small little boutique reinsurance opportunities pipe up on our deals already. Thanks Weston."

            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our Chief Financial Officer as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had a fantastic start to the year. For the first quarter, our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments posted 30% growth in revenue, more than 10% organic growth, net earnings growth of 28%, adjusted EBITDAC growth of 34%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 26%. And we were named a world's most ethical company for the 11th year in a row, an outstanding achievement on its own and a testament to our nearly 40,000 professionals around the globe. As you can tell, I am extremely proud of how the team performed during the quarter. So, let me give you some more detail on our first quarter Brokerage segment performance. During the quarter, reported revenue growth was 32%. Of that, 9.6% was organic, which is just excellent. Rollover revenues of $380 million were pretty consistent with our March IR Day expectations and mostly driven by the December Reinsurance Brokerage acquisition. Doug will have some further comments on rollover revenues in his prepared remarks. Net earnings growth was 27%. Adjusted EBITDAC growth was 35%. And we expanded our adjusted EBITDAC margin by about 50 basis points, an outstanding all-around quarter for the brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and breakdown the 9.6% organic, starting with our PC operations. First, our domestic retail business posted 11% organic driven by terrific new business, strong retention, and continued renewal premium increases. Risk placement services, our domestic wholesale operations, posted organic of 10%. This includes more than 20% organic in open brokerage and 6% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business was better than first quarter \u201821 levels and retention was consistent with prior year. Outside the U.S., our UK business posted organic of 14%. Within retail, fantastic new business and continued renewal premium increases helped drive 10% organic. In our London specialty business, including our legacy Gallagher Re operations, saw 17% organic. Australia and New Zealand combined organic was nearly 10% driven by strong new business, stable retention and higher renewal premium increases. And finally, Canada was up more than 12% organically and continues to benefit from renewal premium increases and great new business production. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business, first quarter organic was up over 7%, more than 1 point better than our March IRD expectation. Our core health and welfare organic was in line with our expectations of 5% and the upside in the quarter was driven by our international operations and our HR consulting, pharmacy benefits and various other life insurance product sales. So, 7% organic in benefits, 11% organic within our PC operations, an excellent quarter. Next, I'd like to make a few comments on the PC market. Overall, global first quarter renewal premium increases were 8%, consistent with the fourth quarter of \u201821 after controlling for line of coverage mix differences. Recall, the renewal premium change includes both rate and exposure. So, let me break that down around the world. About 10% in U.S. retail, including double-digit increases in property, professional liability and casualty somewhat offset by workers' comp and commercial auto. In Canada, New Zealand, renewal premiums were up about 8.5%, with professional liability seeing the strongest increases. In Australia and UK retail, renewal premiums were up mid single-digits driven by increases in casualty and package. Within RPS, wholesale open brokerage premium increases were up 11% and binding operations were up 6%. And in our London specialty business, we saw first quarter rate increases around 7.5%. Moving to reinsurance, as we noted in January, our 1/1 renewals showed price increases that varied by geography and client loss experience. And while rate tended to be based on client-specific attributes in loss history, even loss-free programs faced modest rate increases. Our April Gallagher Re first review report is more focused on Japanese renewals, which tend to dominate the April 1 renewal season. We saw pricing increases in property-related classes, while casualty pricing was flattish despite inflation being a key topic of discussion. You can access our April reinsurance market report on our website for more information. So whether retail, wholesale or reinsurance premiums are still increasing almost everywhere. Looking forward, we expect our mix shift away from workers' compensation renewals in Q1 to U.S. property cat renewals in Q2 will lead to premium increases in the second quarter, very similar to full year 2021. And we see these difficult PC market conditions continuing throughout the remainder of this year. Carriers will likely continue their cautious underwriting stance due to rising loss costs and increases in reinsurance pricing. And this comes at a time when the conflict in Ukraine is elevating geopolitical uncertainty, courts are reopening and global monetary policy is tightening. So from our seat, it looks like carriers will continue to push for rate and don't see a dramatic change in the near-term. Moving to our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business, I see domestic labor market conditions in \u201822 working in our favor. There are more than 11 million job openings in the U.S. That's 5 million more jobs available than people unemployed in looking for work. And that imbalance lays the groundwork for robust demand for our HR and benefits consulting services as employers look to attract, retain and motivate their workforce. So, we finished first quarter with organic of 9.6%. Given our first quarter results and the current insurance market conditions, as we sit here today, we think 22% organic should end up even better than \u201821. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions, starting with some comments on our recent reinsurance acquisition. Integration is progressing at a fast pace and is ahead of schedule. Alongside the speed that we are executing comes the pull-forward of some of the future integration costs, which Doug will cover in his remarks. Also, we had a strong first quarter with the legacy Gallagher Re team growing 30% and our new reinsurance operations delivering towards $340 million of revenue and over $170 million in EBITDAC. And our reinsurance colleagues are melding together extremely well. So, it continues to be a really good story. During the first quarter, we completed 5 new tuck-in brokerage mergers, representing about $32 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. As I look at our tuck-in merger and acquisition pipeline, we have around 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing nearly $250 million of annualized revenue. We know not all of these will close. However, we believe we will get our fair share. Next, I'd like to move to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. First quarter organic growth was 15.2%, better than our IR Day expectation due to a strong March, some new business wins and higher-than-expected COVID claims. Adjusted EBITDAC margin was 17.3% and would have been 18.5%, but we had a litigation settlement late in the quarter. Moving forward, we think the remaining \u201822 quarterly margins will be closer to our 19% expectation. We again saw increases in new arising claims across general liability, property, and to a lesser extent, core workers' compensation during the quarter. New arising COVID claims were well above what we saw during the fourth quarter. However, core claim counts, which tend to have a greater impact on results, still have room to rebound fully to pre-COVID levels. Looking forward, we see ample opportunity for organic revenue growth from existing clients, growing claim counts and new business and expect organic to be around 10% per quarter for the remainder of the year. And let me finish with some thoughts on our bedrock culture. I believe our outstanding financial results are made possible because we are able to act as one company, united by one set of values, the Gallagher Way. As I mentioned earlier, we were once again named a world's most ethical company by Ethisphere, a truly global effort that reflects our colleagues' care and integrity to each other and our clients. Every day, I hear stories of our colleagues working together as one team to give our clients exactly what they need all around the world. That collaboration is possible because we genuinely want to deliver the best possible service at all times. When one team wins, we all win. And then there is the way our people give back to their communities. In March, we announced a special matching donation to provide humanitarian relief to the people of Ukraine. Thanks to the generosity of my Gallagher colleagues. We are able to donate over $1 million for necessities like food, water, supplies and first aid. I am proud to stand together with my Gallagher colleagues impacting communities around the world, and that is the Gallagher way. Okay, I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thank you, Doug. Darryl, I think we're ready to open up for questions, please. Thanks, Paul. Well, in fact, Paul, we looked at the stats before this call, and over the last eight quarters, the renewal rates across our book, including, I should add, the exposure units are about flat, around 8.5% to 9%. So I mean it varies up to 9%, 9.5%, it comes down to it. But I would say any kind of a wholesale drop-off is not what we're seeing, to Doug's point. But we do know, Paul, I mean let's face it, a lot of the competition from our private equity competitors for acquisitions has been driven by free money. And if they got to start paying for it I think that bodes well for us. Cash, no, we haven't seen anything. Thanks, Paul. Hi, Mark. We've got it at the table somewhere, Mark, do you have another question? There is two things I'd comment on, Mark, really. One is it's been in very interesting hard market. And as you know, looking over the past, what is now almost 4 years, comp hasn't moved. Comp has not been a big rate driver up and it's not coming down. So it's been an interesting line. And as the economy becomes more robust. And frankly, when we pick up \u2013 when we start to fill some of those 11 million jobs, I think the natural increase in claim activity is going to really benefit Gallagher Bassett. We clearly can track back that when our economy is humming, it's just a natural outcome. You don't like to see people get hurt, but we have more claim volume. That's number one. Number two, what I continue to be astounded by, and I'm sure everybody on this call reads it every week as well, when I look at our social inflation around tort, it's incredible. And so I think what you're seeing is, number one, case settlements at levels that never any of us would have predicted but also what that does is it drives our clients to be much more cautious and concerned about claims that, frankly, in the past, they might have said, pay us $50,000, move on or let's not settle that. It doesn't look like that big a deal. I mean not to get anecdotal on you all, but it is late in the evening. And you probably saw the settlement last week for some guy who got $450,000 because this company threw a surprise party for him. I mean I keep asking the folks for a surprise party. But it's just \u2013 so that I do think is beneficial to GB. And GB continues to invest and I think capable of proving that if, in fact, you use our services, with all that we bring to the table, our outcomes are better. So all of a sudden, if you're used to getting a lot of claims, but one of them every 5 years tends to pop. And now you're looking at it, you go, man, what's happening? I'm starting to get 2 a year, 3 a year. Now who pays those claims makes a bigger and bigger difference. And I think that bodes well for the long-term. Really not that much dislocation on the reinsurance side. And I would say, back to my prepared remarks, depending on the carrier, depending on the carriers experience. That's what's driving the renewals. And Doug, go ahead. Thanks, Mark. Hi, Greg. Well, first of all, Greg, I'm not going to sit here and predict a recession. Unfortunately, we've lived through them before. And I think we do know how to react to those. And when you're in a recession, a couple of things happen that are very, very negative. Exposure units drop, companies go broke, expenses become even more important, not that they are ever not important, and shopping can go up. Now when shopping goes up for our strength, in particular, in the middle market, I think we show well. So we hold our own there. But when you've got a robust economy falling off, you end up with negative audits and you've got lesser exposure units. And depending on the depth of that recession, it's not a pretty picture. So when you talk about what are we doing relative to our risk management approach, we talk about it every quarter. We take a look at where we are. We've got significant margins, and we prepare to say here's what we have to do to make sure that \u2013 one of the things I really like about our model is we basically pay our production for us on how their book of business performs. So, we are all in this together and if the business is sinking. Now in previous recessions, if I don't go back too far, we've not had the benefit of inflation. So inflation may, in fact, help cause a recession and I don't know whether that will be 1 point, 2 points. I know the first quarter GDP was down. But if you're talking 5% to 8% inflation, that has the exact opposite impact. As you know, payrolls go up. We are all seeing that. I mean, I can't go a day without somebody stopping me and saying we are getting whacked. I've got a mid-level service person, and it's a problem and what am I going to do about it? And every customer is coming to Bill's or Bell's team and saying, how am I going to hold on to my people. Everybody wants them. They go to a restaurant. They don't have people that can serve you. I mean there is just huge demand, and that's pushing payrolls up. And our contractors book, they bid everything out and now they got to deliver at inflation rates they never anticipated when they made the bid. Well, if there is other business to bid, those rates are going up. So sales will go up. So there is offsetting factors there. And I think our business holds up pretty darn well in a recession. And also, let me remind you, back in 2007, \u201808, \u201809, and this is just an incredible support of this model again. You'd think oh, my gosh, it's going to be our clients will stop paying their people before they stop paying their insurance bill. That's how important we are to them. That's a good spot to be. Thanks, Greg. Hi, Elyse. I'll let Doug answer the actual number piece on that because a lot of that's mathematical. But in terms of what I'm seeing for the year, I'm not seeing \u2013 I'm not anticipating significant change in the operating environment over the next three quarters. Yes. I will do that, Lisa. It's really been an amazing and let's remember, as we finished the quarter, we are four months in. So, as we have this call, we are close to five months. But I will tell you that the team, we are not losing people, we are not losing clients. Our renewals have been fantastic. Tom, myself, others at the table have had a chance to meet with reinsurance clients. They continue to be very open about the fact that they are glad. That they are \u2013 there is not one less competitor in the marketplace. They are also very clear with us that the reason that the business held together over the years of discussion as to where this business was going to land was because of the people handling their business. And those people are still in place. Our losses in terms of people out the door are minimal to zero. And so when I look at it, I am really, really happy about it. And new business pipeline is strong. What I am very excited about is the integration that we are seeing or the sharing of information from our retail. Everybody said at the beginning, why is this good for retail. And people also would ask, why does reinsurance care what you are doing as a retailer. Well, I will tell you what. There is so much going back and forth right now in terms of data relative to the business we are doing with all kinds of carriers, with things that our reinsurance people are seeing can help our retailers and they are melding. So, the business is strong. We are absolutely nailing it when it comes to what we hope the performer would be and I think it's going to continue to be a great business for us. Thanks Elyse. Hi David. Great. Well, let me go around the world again as I did in my prepared remarks. So, if you take a look at what we are seeing in Canada. And it's \u2013 our team in terms of new business is on fire. When we closed on Neuraxis years ago and the Canadian economy was a little flush where it was a little slow. We weren't together. Neuraxis has seven separate businesses kind of operating separately. Now that business is totally together. The Gallagher branding is working extremely well. People are pumped up. We are using sales force. Our pipeline has grown and the 10% organic, yes, it's helped by rate, but new business is much better than it's ever been. When you go to the UK, that same timeframe, we have added new \u2013 recall, we bought Heath Lambert, Giles, etcetera, again, a lot of time on integration. Today, we will do an acquisition of size in the UK. And frankly, we have got that thing integrated in five months to seven months. And they are putting on a Gallagher jersey. They are excited about it. Then our team just gets stronger and stronger there. Now, I can't tell you that economic events aren't going to impact us. Recessions are terrible. Bad for our clients, they are bad for us, and they are bad for our business. But I would tell you that where we are from a team perspective is fantastic. So, you are right to look through the numbers and say it seems like international is doing really well because as we walked around the world and told you the organic, they are just killing it everywhere. Latin America is strong. New Zealand is strong. Australia is strong, and all of that is not just rate driven. That's the thing I want to make sure everybody realizes is that it's not just because rates are moving, we are getting our fair share of our new business opportunities. And in fact, we are seeing hit ratios improve and we are being helped by our clients' business expansions and just blocking and tackling. So, it's a very good spot to be. David, I think it's fair to say, too, what we have done in the United States in terms of the things you have seen in your SmartMarket, Gallagher Drive. Those things are impacting our new business with carriers, our retention and clearly, our new business hit ratios using SmartMarket, and we are taking those internationally now. So, that was born and bred here in the U.S. But those are our products that are going to be available in Canada and the UK to start. And they are difference makers. And really remember, when we compete and this is one of the things about again, kind of being in a lucky spot. 90% of the time when our people go out the door to compete, we are competing with somebody smaller. Say at 10%, 11%, 12% of the time, we are competing with folks that, frankly, can come to the table with the same type of resources or story. But every other time, when I talk to our sales force, I think we should win. We don't, obviously, but I think that's having an impact. Our people go out the door thinking they are going to win, I will tell you that. Thanks David. They are going to overdo that. That's not \u2013 my prediction is it will not. Correct. Well, I got to understand the question. I mean our reinsurance clients pay us very, very, very well and very fairly and now a stable environment is not going to give us the ability to charge our clients. Does it give us the ability to invest more favorably, absolutely, because you now have people and our old business is people. To be perfectly blunt, there were people who were going to join them before, like join them in the middle of a sale. Nobody knows \u2013 by the way, remember, I am not making this up, it was public. I mean they couldn't tell the people at Willis where they are going to sit, who are they going to work for. That's not easy to recruit into, is it. Well, there is lots of opportunities to invest. There is lots of \u2013 at the same time, reinsurance buyers are kind of frozen in the headlights. We want to see competition in the market. We don't want Willis, frankly, to disappear, but we are not going to build the problem bigger. So, yes, there is opportunities for us to go back to those clients and say, \u201cHey, we think we have got something to tell you now.\u201d So, I think once it settles down and we all get \u2013 again, I am four months into the quarter, five months in total, a year from now I will have a much better feel for the individuals. Thanks Meyer. The numbers we were talking about in the pipeline in our prepared remarks are totally outside of Willis Re. Willis Re is done, those are... No. Our retail operations have zero distraction by the Willis Re folks. Thanks Weston. Darryl, I think that's all our questions for tonight. So, I would like to just say thank you again for joining us. Obviously, we had a fantastic start to 2022. I would like to thank our colleagues around the globe for their hard work. We are a people business and our results directly reflect your efforts. Thank you. We look forward to speaking with you again at our June Investor Day, and thanks for being with us, everybody."

It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter '23 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had a strong fourth quarter to wrap up another fantastic year. All measures were right in line with what we said during our December IR Day. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 20% growth in revenue, headline 8.1% organic growth, but that's more like 9.4% controlling for the 606 accounting and large life case timing. We also had a terrific merger and acquisition quarter. We completed 14 mergers totaling $410 million of estimated annualized revenue. GAAP earnings per share of $0.30 and net earnings margin of 2.8% were impacted by the counterintuitive earn-out payable accounting that Doug will elaborate on in a few minutes. So, better to look at it more on a comparable basis. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.22, up 23% year-over-year, and we posted an EBITDAC margin of 30.1%, up 69 basis points over fourth quarter '22. What a terrific quarter to close out an incredibly good year by the team. When I think about our growth for the full year, we are up 18% in revenue, that's an increase of $1.5 billion. That's amazing. Moving to results on a segment basis, starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 20%. Organic headline was 7.2%, but I see it more like 8.7% without the accounting and timing noise, and 11% if you include interest income. Adjusted EBITDAC was $647 million, growing 21% year-over-year, and we posted adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 48 basis points. Let me give you some insights behind our Brokerage segment organic, and just to level set, the following does not include interest income. Our global retail P&C brokerage operations posted organic of 8%. This includes about 8% organic in the U.S., 8% in the U.K., 5% in Canada, 10% in Australia and New Zealand. Our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of 2% or 6%, controlling for the timing of those large life cases. Shifting to reinsurance, wholesale and specialty businesses, overall organic of 14%. This includes Gallagher Re at 12%, U.S. wholesale at 12% and U.K. specialty at 16%. So, all of these are very similar to what we were seeing throughout the year. Next, let me provide some thoughts on the P/C insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Global fourth quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure changes, were up 8.5%. That's in-line with the 8% to 10% renewal premium change we have been reporting throughout '22 and '23. Renewal premium increases continue to be broad-based, up across all of our major geographies and most product lines. For example, property is up 15%, even in a slow cat property quarter. General liability is up 6%, workers' comp is up 2%, umbrella and package are each up about 10%. Shifting to the reinsurance market. 1/1 renewals were orderly reflected a more balanced supply-demand dynamic. Continued strong demand for property cat cover was met with sufficient reinsurance capacity from existing reinsurers and cat bonds. Importantly, reinsurers continue to exercise discipline on pricing and terms, not giving back the structural changes achieved last year. In casualty, while there was adequate supply, most casualty treaties experienced pricing pressure. Specialty lines renewed mostly flattish. However, coverage limitations continued on war-related products. So, in our view, insurance and reinsurance carriers continued to behave rationally, pushing for a rate where it's needed to generate an acceptable underwriting profit. Property is still needing rate. And more and more, we're hearing about the need for rate in casualty lines. If prior year development turns into a big concern, we think it could be a multiyear journey of rate increases. All that said, always remember, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases. So, not all these renewal premium increases ultimately show up in our organic. Moving to our customers' business activity. Overall, it continues to be strong. During the fourth quarter, our daily indication showed positive midyear policy endorsements and audits ahead of last year's levels. So, we are not seeing a slowdown. The same strength is also evident in the U.S. labor market with continued growth in non-farm payrolls and low unemployment rate, which is why I believe our HR consulting retirement and benefits business will have terrific opportunities in '24. As we sit here today, we are very well positioned. 2023 was a great new business year, and I believe we will continue to win new clients while retaining our existing customers. We have incredible niche expertise. Our client service is top notch, and our data and analytics continues to distance ourselves from the competition. We can handle any account of any size, anywhere around the globe. All this leads me to reaffirm that we will still see further '24 Brokerage organic in the 7% to 9% range that would lead to another outstanding year. Shifting to mergers and acquisitions. We had an excellent fourth quarter, completing 13 new brokerage mergers, representing about $350 million of estimated annualized revenue. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing family of Gallagher professionals. And we are off to a strong start to '24. We've already closed four brokerage mergers here in January for about $30 million of annualized revenue. We also have around 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $350 million of annualized revenue. We know not all of these will ultimately close, but we believe we'll get our fair share, clearly, a very strong pipeline. Moving on to Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was terrific at 13.2%, full year at 15.8%. Adjusted fourth quarter EBITDAC margins of 21% and full year at 20%, all this right in-line with our December expectations. We also completed one merger in Australia with expected annualized revenue of about $60 million, adding new capabilities in the disability space. Looking forward, we continue to see '24 year organic in the 9% to 11% range and full year margins close to 20%, and that would be another outstanding year. And I'll conclude with some comments regarding our bedrock culture. It's a culture of client service, ethics and teamwork encapsulated in the Gallagher way. It is an unrelenting culture of excellence that helped drive full year '23 results for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments of 18% growth in revenue, of which 10% was organic. 51 mergers with nearly $900 million in estimated annualized revenue and 20% growth in adjusted EBITDAC. Most importantly, we have a culture that our people believe in, embrace and live every day. It's a huge competitive advantage and will continue to fuel our success and growth. That is the Gallagher way. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our earnings release commenting on fourth quarter and full year organic and margins by segment. I'll also provide some comments on our full year '24 outlook. We'll then shift to the CFO Commentary document that we posted on our IR website where I'll provide some comments on our typical modeling helpers and then give two short vignettes, one on investment income and another as a quick refresher on earn-out payable accounting. I'll then conclude my prepared remarks with a few comments on cash, M&A and capital management. Okay. Let's flip to Page 3 of the earnings release. Headline, fourth quarter Brokerage organic of 7.2% is right in-line with our December IR Day expectation of 7% to 7.5%. But as Pat noted, we see that closer to 8.7% and organic of 11% if we were to also include interest income. That's a darn good quarter, no matter what percentage you want to focus on. A couple of other puts and takes to call out on that page. First, contingents did come in a little bit better than our December thinking due to more favorable carrier performance than we thought at that time. And second, base commission and fee organic of 6.5%. That's where you should levelize for the impact of 606 in those life cases. Controlling for those takes that over 8%. Looking ahead to '24, our Brokerage segment organic outlook is unchanged from our late October and mid-December expectations. We still see full year organic growth in that 7% to 9% range. All right. Let's flip to Page 5 of the earnings release, to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. Adjusted fourth quarter EBITDAC margin was up 48 basis points. But remember, to get to that requires recomputing last year's fourth quarter using current FX rates. We've done that in this table and is 31.3% for fourth quarter '22. So, posting a 31.6% margin this quarter gives you that 48 basis points of margin expansion, and that's right at the high end of our December IR Day expectation. Then, if you control for the role in Buck and other mergers we closed late in the quarter that have some seasonality, that would have been 150 basis points of expansion. That's simply terrific work by the team. Looking ahead to next year, we anticipate seeing some full year margin expansion starting at 4% organic. And if organic was, say, double that, maybe around 60 basis points of expansion. And note, that includes about 40 basis points of pressure against it due to the roll in of M&A, mostly Buck. On a quarterly basis, the headwind is about 80 to 90 basis points in the first quarter '24. So, please don't forget to reflect this nuance in your models. Okay. Moving to the Risk Management segment and the organic and EBITDAC tables on Pages 5 and 6. Another excellent quarter for Gallagher Bassett, 13.2% organic growth and margins at 21%. We continue to benefit from new business wins and excellent retention. Looking forward, even as we lap growth associated with some large new business wins from early '23, we see full year '24 organic in that 9% to 11% range and margins around 20%, again, that's unchanged from our December views. So, let's turn to Page 7 of the earnings release and the corporate segment shortcut table. Total segment adjusted fourth quarter numbers came in a little better than the favorable end of our December IR Day expectations due to less borrowing on our line of credit and slightly lower corporate expenses. So, now let's shift to the CFO Commentary document, to Page 3, that's where we provide many modeling helpers. Most of the fourth quarter actual numbers are very close to our December IR Day estimates. We've also now added 2024 information. So, take a look at that. In particular, as we -- take a look at FX. We are expecting a small headwind to EPS in the first half within the Brokerage segment. Now, moving to Page 4 of the CFO Commentary document, to the corporate segment outlook for full year '24. There's no change there to our full year estimate that we provided six weeks ago during our IR Day, but we are now providing quarterly estimates. So, please take some time to refine your models with us added information. When you get to Page 5, this page shows our tax credit carryforwards. You'll see what we discussed at our December IR Day. We are able to reestablish a portion of our tax credits following the change in tax method election when we filed our '22 U.S. federal tax return here in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, as of December 31, we have about $870 million of tax credits available. That's a nice future cash flow sweetener that helps us fund future M&A. So, let's turn to the new table that we put in the top of Page 6. We thought this would be helpful as we've been giving a lot of questions about our investment income line. The punchline is that this line includes items such as premium finance revenues, book gains and equity investments in third-party brokers in addition to interest income. So, this table breaks it down for you by quarter. We hope you will find this helpful. We've also renamed that line in our financial statements to clarify that it contains other items. No numbers change, we've just broadened the descriptor. So, just shifting down on that page, on Page 6, you'll see total Brokerage rollover revenue for fourth quarter was $180 million. That's consistent with our IR Day expectation. Looking forward, we've included estimated revenues for mergers closed through yesterday for the Brokerage segment in that table and for the Risk Management segment in the text below that table. Based on Brokerage and Risk Management mergers closed through yesterday, we're estimating around $540 million of rollover revenues to be recognized in '24. And also, don't forget, you'll need to make a pick for future M&A and also add interest expense as we fund a portion of those acquisitions via future borrowings. So, while I'm on the topic of M&A, as we foreshadowed in December, we did increase our estimated earn-out payable for Willis Re during the quarter because we now have good line of sight of what we might pay out in the first quarter of 2025. Remember, the accounting for earn-out payables is a bit backwards. If expectations of performance are more favorable, it creates GAAP expense. And if expectations of performance are less favorable, it creates GAAP income. That's what Pat meant when he said counterintuitive accounting. That said, we do adjust these estimate changes, but were the highlight because it does create some GAAP earnings noise. The punchline on all this and what's more important, our reinsurance business is performing extremely well. So, moving to cash, capital management and M&A funding. Available cash on hand at December 31 was about $400 million. And with another year of strong expected cash flow generation here in '24, we estimate about $3.5 billion of capacity to fund M&A in '24 using only free cash and incremental borrowings. So, those are my comments. As I reflect on '23, two metrics for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments really sum up how good our year was: revenue growth of 18%, up $1.5 billion; and adjusted EBITDAC growth of 20% or nearly $550 million. So, the team delivered another terrific year, and we all have tremendous momentum to do it again here in '24. Back to you, Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you, Doug. And operator, I think we can go to questions now, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening. My first question, within the 7% to 9% organic Brokerage guide for 2024, can you guys give us a sense of what you're assuming for pricing and economic exposure throughout the course of the year?\nDouglas Howell: Well, I think when we did that in our budget process, the range of 7% to 9%, it's pretty much so what we're seeing today throughout next year is really the assumptions. Where are we today in pricing, where are we in exposure units, what we've been running here this year, we don't see a lot of change to that next year.\nElyse Greenspan: And then when you guys go through and come up with the 7% to 9%, are you assuming that all of your businesses will be in that range? I mean, now you've been seeing really strong growth within reinsurance, wholesale and specialty. Are those expected to continue to be above and maybe some of the others like benefits might be below? How do you see the different businesses shaking out in '24?\nDouglas Howell: All right. So on that point, not every business has given a flat target number, they view it based on what they're seeing in the marketplace rate, exposure, opportunities, hiring, hiring new producers. So, every business does that differently. What would I say is being different? Who's on the upper end of the range? And who's on maybe the lower end of the range? Benefits might be a little bit on the lower end of the range, and you might see reinsurance and specialty on the upper end of the range in that. But by and large, each business unit rolls it up and that's how we get to that 7% to 9% range.\nElyse Greenspan: And then, Pat, you mentioned some interesting comments on the casualty side. We're starting to hear your thoughts about pricing pressure and just you said right, multiyear journey here. Can you just tell us like what you're seeing and then how you expect this cycle could transpire assuming we do start to see more reserve holes emerge across the industry?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I just think it makes some logical sense, at least. When you take a look back, we saw this in the property side. Nobody touched values for five, six, seven years because inflation was zero. And so you've got a bunch of reserves on the casualty side, set at those very same years that all of a sudden you come into a spike in inflation. And yes, it's been tamped down, but it's still there. And you look back at those reserves and then you take a look at these settlements that are, in fact, nuclear. And you start to say, well, all right, how well are those reserves going to hold up? Now look, I can't speak for the industry as a whole. But my sense in the meetings that we're having and discussions we're having with a number of the various carriers is that they have some concerns there that they are not necessarily comfortable with exactly where they are. And so, our view on that is, okay, if you take a look at if there were inflation in those numbers and if it were something where you had to get them right, you'd have to see price increases in order to do it. I don't think that, that's something with the kind of payout structure that you have in casualty that you need to get in one year. So, I think you're going to see possibly affirming that does, in fact, take a few years to catch up with reality.\nElyse Greenspan: And then one last one. Have you guys reserved to the maximum on the earn-out associated with the Willis Re deal?\nDouglas Howell: Effectively yes. I mean we still have to accrete that for one more year. So it might be -- I think there's $50 million of accretion that will go through the financial statements this next year.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Elyse. Thanks for being with us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Hughes with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Hughes: Yeah, thanks, good afternoon.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi, Mark.\nMark Hughes: Pat, did you give the organic for open brokerage versus the program business within wholesale?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I think open brokerage has been where we've had the real nice run-up. I mean it's probably double to triple what's going on in the program business. So, if you look at open brokerage that running around 13% to 15%, you're probably looking at 5% on the programs.\nMark Hughes: And then, what's your take on the property market? Do you think little bit of deceleration there? Well, one, do you think that's the case? And two, would it have any kind of material impact on your organic?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I think -- well, I mean, any change in pricing is going to have an impact on organic. But I'm not -- no, I don't see carriers at this point saying, \"Oh, the good news is I can take the price backwards.\" So, we are still seeing a push on property rate. And then you do, of course, have carriers incredibly focused on valuations. That kind of went by the wayside for years. There was no inflation, fine, 0% blah, blah, blah. Now claims are coming in, they didn't get their premium for it, the replacement costs are substantially higher than they may be predicted. And so, I think you do have a little bit of time left where there's going to be some valuation correction, and I do think there is a need for continued rate strengthening.\nMark Hughes: Thank you very much.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Mark. Thanks for being with us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey, good evening. So first question on M&A. You guys have been extremely successful integrating and acquiring firms. But I'm just curious if the landscape has changed a bit in terms of kind of what's available. And, I guess, just for example, when I was -- you've announced a few bank-owned brokers. I believe, historically, there's two of your competitors that did most of those, and they would -- one of them would talk openly about those deals being tougher, meaning take a couple of years to turn them into the growth machines that those companies are and Buck was a little different, too. So just curious if the pool is changing a bit, and so we should kind of expect probably different types of deals going forward versus the historical five, 10 years.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I'd tell you, first of all, let's remember. I think that when we do acquisitions, we like to talk about the fact that we're getting two things. We're not just getting revenue and earnings, which, of course, we want, we get. But we're getting terrific brains. And the bank-owned deals happen to be more sizable and they've got a lot of terrific people. And in addition to the brain power we're getting, we're getting expertise in the niches from the brain power, but we're also getting more volume in areas that now are spreading the brand. And it adds to that the virtuous circle of knowing about Gallagher, listening to the con-call, accepting the call. And I think what we're seeing is that our acquisition targets come aboard, and I guess this is the right way to phrase it, they kind of get on fire. It is our organic engine. There's no question about it. They come in. They've got a lot to say. Now, the bank deals are bigger. But if you take our day-in and down-out, roll-in acquisitions, these are people that more often than not have not been able to really tackle the large accounts in their own geography. In the minute they sign on to us, they're out telling those clients we're part of Gallagher, here's what we've got, let me tell you about the expertise we've got, let me show you some of the things that we do in data and analytics. You've all heard us talk about drive. What do people like you buy? What kind of limits should you have? So, we arm them with tools that they just -- whether they're in a bank or not a bank, they've never had before. So, the excitement level does not take a long time to resonate. The calls go out pretty immediately, \"Hey, did you hear that we're part of another firm.\" And these are not folks that are in any way on their back foot. They are on the front foot and moving literally at the day of closing.\nDouglas Howell: Yeah. Let me add one thing on that. I think that the organic in Cadence and Eastern was running very similar to what we're seeing in our similar geographies in similar areas. So I think your premise was that it take a while to restart them. I think they're already started. I think they're going after it. Buck is already showing terrific organic growth. We don't get it in our numbers for a year. So somebody goes out and sells something within the year, but we never get organic credit for that. And we get the revenues for it, but we don't get the organic growth credit in our numbers. So, I wouldn't say that the premise was, if the ones that we bought that they were -- they needed a restart.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No, in fact, Mike, I'll tell you what we're referring to in our process is the Gallagher effect. The Gallagher effect is what happens after you announced you're part of Gallagher. It's not a slowdown, explain it. It takes their list, their pipeline of prospects and energizes the team to go back and tell about we really have something new to talk about here. And it's not just about, I know you. I've called on you many times. I've got a good relationship in the marketplace. Can I talk to you about your pricing? It's a hard market, soft market, but no, no. This is -- let me bring some data and analytics. Let me show you what's going on in our niches. We have experts in your specific area that I think you're going to want to meet. It's pretty exciting, actually. When I get a chance to get involved, it turns me on.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. No, I appreciate that color. Switching gears and you could tell me if I'm splitting hairs here. But on the December Investor Day, there was a number of reasons you kind of lowered the very near-term 4Q organic growth estimates versus what you previously have been thinking. And I think a couple of those sounded like they were more of like a push into '24 like on the life insurance side and maybe entertainment business rebounding. But I didn't think you really brought up your -- you didn't bring up your '24 guide. So I guess, should we seasonally -- obviously, we know there's seasonality in the quarters, but should we be thinking 1Q or the first half of the year gets a little bit more of a bump than it does historically? Or am I just reading too much into things?\nDouglas Howell: I think you're missing the magnitude of this. In the quarter, let's call it, $10 million, we get $15 million in total here that gets pushed out on a $10 billion business next year. Okay, it's 10 or 15 basis points in there, but so that wouldn't be enough to change that 7% to 9% guide in there.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay, And just lastly, you're one of the leaders. You've been doing it successfully for a while in terms of moving folks -- or sorry, in your center of excellence. Any changes in kind of the trajectory there in terms of what you guys talked about last year in terms of kind of the goal of kind of doubling, maybe the percentage of employees there over the next five or so years?\nDouglas Howell: I think what we said is that over the next five or seven years, we'll need twice as many people there as we have there now. I think what's really exciting about all the work that we've done for almost two decades there now has put us in a position of being so standardized in many of the processes that we do. We now have the opportunity to unleash AI on that because that's already done. We have made that investment. And now what we can do is deploy AI against it. And, look, those folks, if you're going to hire twice as many folks, they're going to end up with better jobs over there because they're going to be using AI. So, our colleagues there are going to be well rewarded by deploying that technology into it. So, we are really fired up about it.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah. Let me hit a couple of other items. Why would we need to double our employee count there because we're going to double the business. And that's going to lead to plenty of opportunities there. Secondly, and I think this is a hugely important point. Standardizing a Brokerage business from an agency system through the operating processes to things like issuing certificates of insurance is a [indiscernible]. It takes four, five years to bang it through. I've done it. It's a headache. We're there. We don't need to do it. We don't need to sell it. It's standard operating procedure. When you join us, you know that in your due diligence, you come aboard, you plan the effort to change into our agency system and you get rewarded for it by virtue of the data and analytics we can provide you to go out and sell. We don't need to sell our team on that. We don't need to prove it to them. We did that 15 years ago.\nMichael Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nDavid Motemaden: Hey, good evening.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi, Dave.\nDavid Motemaden: I just had a question on -- just on -- it looks like there was a little bit of favorable timing during the quarter on incentive compensation expenses that helped the margin in Brokerage. Was that a big help? And is that something that you guys have sort of baked into the first quarter of '24, just that timing coming through?\nDouglas Howell: Well, first of all, we talked about that, I think, back in our April or June call that we were probably a little further ahead at that point of the year and our incentive comp accruals. So that's been contemplated in our guidance of margin expansion since way back then. So that -- I would say there's no new news of what we were expecting in December versus what we delivered this quarter. And what's the impact of it? It's not a point. I mean, so it's not a big number.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Understood. And then I just wanted to come back to the 7% to 9% Brokerage organic for 2024 and sort of level set in terms of what you guys are thinking on the exposure growth side, the range of outcomes that you guys are considering within that 7% to 9%.\nDouglas Howell: All right. So I think when you break down our organic, we usually have more net new versus lost is probably 3% to 4% on that. When you get some rate in there, probably, we're at that 2 points and maybe there's 2 points of it, that's 2 or 3 points that's exposure unit growth. I don't -- we're going to have more lift next year from new versus lost probably proportionately. So, if you break down 9%, it might be a third, a third, a third. If you break down 7%, it's probably half rate -- excuse me, mostly new business and then exposure unit growth again.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Understood. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please state your question.\nGregory Peters: Good evening, everyone. I guess I'm going to the new table that you added to the CFO Commentary, which we appreciate, which is the interest income, premium finance revenues and other income. And could you give us some perspective, because ever since mid-December, when the Fed changed their perspective on what's going to happen with rates, there's obviously some mechanics we're trying to calculate on what might happen with that line depending on what the Fed does with interest rates? So maybe there's some benchmarks you can provide for us that will help us sort of map out what we think might happen there.\nDouglas Howell: All right. So you got the rate sensitivity and you've got the amount of cash that we have on our balance sheet, that's not only ours, but our clients, okay? So, first and foremost, it's both the rate that we're earning and then it's the -- on what we're earning that on. Second of all, you've got the dynamic. You mentioned the Fed. The U.S. portion of that interest income is only about 45% of the numbers. So it's actually more heavily weighted to internationally, and you would expect that with kind of large reinsurance balances in some of the large specialty businesses that we have in the U.K. So you got to separate your thinking on that. The other thing, too, is that you've got the growth as it grew this year, it was not only because of rate that was going up, but it was also because of the way the reinsurance receivables migrated from Willis' books onto our books during the transition services agreement. So you got that dynamic in it. I think what you're trying to plumb for is how sensitive is that number to rate changes. I would say that it's price-sensitive $5 million per rate cut that the Fed does in the U.S. per year. So if there's 4 points in, there's $20 million -- four cuts that might be $20 million. Again, that's just answering your question about the Fed. How the other central banks, what they do with their policy next year, I just don't have that number right off the top of my head. But when you asked about the Fed, think about it as $5 million per cut.\nGregory Peters: Excellent. Just a follow-up on that table for '23. And what quarter did the services agreement with WTW shift? Because I assume that would have meant the change...\nDouglas Howell: July 1.\nGregory Peters: July 1. So when we're looking at the third quarter and fourth quarter, that's more normalized under going forward operating conditions, correct?\nDouglas Howell: That's correct.\nGregory Peters: Thank you for that clarification.\nDouglas Howell: Yes, it's important for -- yes, okay. You've got the premium finance just to make sure you know that there's expenses associated with premium finance that's down there. So that's a spread business. But you get -- gross is up. We get the revenues up above, and then we get the -- we have the operating expenses and the interest costs down below in operational.\nGregory Peters: That's excellent detail. I appreciate that. And then there's a bigger picture question I have before I get there. I can't -- I'm hung up on the clean energy tax credit carryforward balance, which caught me by surprise going up. And I know there's obviously a revised approach towards your tax credits here. But without getting into detailed commentary on the changes and the nuances and the tax, is it your expectation going forward that this -- that you're still going to be pulling down $150 million or more of tax credits from clean energy going forward? And then, is that $867 million just related to the clean energy? Or is there other things in that?\nDouglas Howell: All right. So, two things. You can see on Page 5, we have reaffirmed that we think that there'd be about $150 million worth of utilization of that balance in '24. And maybe when you get to '25, '26, '27 is somewhere around $180 million of utilization in a year. So, you need to think about it coming in over the next four years. There is a very small other balance of credits in there that I would say is a rounding there, and it has to do with when we construct our home office building. But for all intents and purposes, consider these credits to be from our clean energy work.\nGregory Peters: Great. So, pivoting back to the bigger picture question is, I'm going to focus on reinsurance because last year was one of the most challenging reinsurance renewal periods in our lifetimes, and especially on the cat side, I should say. And clearly, based on your commentary and others, it seems like it's going to be more normal this year. It seems like the lift you might get from the pricing or rate component is going to be a lot less this year than it was last year. So I don't want to get too hung up on -- and I realize casualty has its own cadence, but I was just curious about your response to that observation and how you think it might work with Gallagher?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, first of all, let me just say that when I look back, I can't tell you how proud I am of the team. We came into a year, new to the organization, we've got some expertise for sure that got paid, but it was very difficult a year ago. And we basically, in a tough environment, took care of our clients. And I think that's really -- we learned a lot all of us from that. And then we come around to this year, yeah, the supply and demand balance was a little easier, but what you've got now is a group of our clients that, number one, the price is up, and number two, demand is up. So, you've got pricing not coming down and people looking and saying, \"No, okay, it's not as sloppy as it was a year ago, I'd like to get more of that.\" And we saw a bunch of that at 1/1. Remember, about 45% of our business is book 1/1. So, the year when it comes to cat property is pretty much in the bank. And it's been a great year. Easier to place than last year, but as I said, demand up and pricing up. So, it still remains a very good market for us, and one in which there aren't that many people, Greg, that can do what we do for our clients. And our larger competitors are very, very good. But it falls off pretty quick after us.\nGregory Peters: That's right, all right, Thanks for the answers.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thank you, Greg. Thanks for being with us.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Kligerman: Hey, thanks a lot, and good evening. I just want to clarify, Doug, when you were saying $5 million per rate cut, just define what you meant by rate cut? How much rate gets cut?\nDouglas Howell: 25 basis points.\nAndrew Kligerman: How many?\nDouglas Howell: 25. They do at 25. I was referring to a rate cut of 25 basis points.\nAndrew Kligerman: 25 bps. Perfect. Thank you. And then, with respect to Gallagher Re, could you talk a bit about how the cross-selling with Risk Management is playing in? Is that a big driver? And also, I understand you're going to be moving into facultative reinsurance and -- or maybe you've been doing that. What kind of tailwinds do those provide to 2024?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I mean, first of all, I have to say that the reinsurance team has been incredibly pleased with and nicely surprised by the amount of interaction with our retail team around the world. And when we did the deal, we told the team and ourselves that we thought there was a considerable benefit from having both sides of the equation under one roof, and that is playing out over and over and over again. As you know, we're very, very strong in our niche or niche marketing, and that's a global play. And the capability to have the reinsurance perspective in those meetings, and then we're the largest player in the pooling sector for public clients in the United States. We kind of thought we had that pretty well nailed. Not a lot to learn. Our reinsurance team has added a tremendous amount of value and helped us add cover for the pools and revenue for our retailers and revenue for our reinsurance people. So, it's been an incredible two-year journey, and we're just getting started in terms of the opportunity to play together in the sandbox. What was the other question, Andrew?\nAndrew Kligerman: Facultative...\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Facultative, but of course, now coming along with treaty clients and having our retailers -- here is an example of what you're talking about, where retailers are trying to get things done and oftentimes it's hard to place areas like property, et cetera. We are seeing our facultative opportunities grow. No, it's not brand new. But we are organizing ourselves better in the fac world. And I think we're getting -- we're in a better position today than six months ago to go out to our insurance carrier customers and our trading partners and say, \"We want to participate in this. We want to help you.\" So, we are seeing an uptick in opportunities.\nAndrew Kligerman: Lot of tailwinds there. Shifting over to Risk Management and the organic change in fees. I mean, just it seems terrific. And I'm just wondering on the claims management side, what kind of carriers are you growing with? Are they the large ones? Or are they the small ones? Like where are you seeing the most growth in claims management?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, you're seeing two things. One, our historical play in the Risk Management accounts, where you've got large accounts, you name it, whatever the large hotel chains or what have you, that are procuring our business on their accounts. And there's -- we've got a great, great year in that regard, and that includes public sector clients as well. And then as you know, we have over the last decade or so really focused on outsourcing of claims from insurance companies. And I don't have liberty on this call to name some of those because some of those carriers are pretty well-known carriers and not one that I necessarily have the approval to be touting. But from inside the organization, you look at some of these carriers you go, it's fantastic. And then, of course, the regional small companies that would like to expand that don't want to add infrastructure, they think they've got an opportunity in a given stage or geography. They don't want to be putting a lot of boots on the ground. We're picking those up as well. So, the team at GB is, in my opinion, just outperformed expectations every single year.\nAndrew Kligerman: It just seems like in the carriers, I mean, there's just a lot of runway there.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, let me put it this way, Andrew. I really believe this. I believe that it will not be unusual, and I believe that people will ask. \"Did insurance companies pay their own claims? Why would they do that?\" When I sit with some of our insurance company partners and explain to them that Gallagher Bassett pays substantially more claims in numeric numbers and substantially more dollars than they do in claims by line of cover, by geography, not just in the U.S., the first reaction is oftentimes shock. And again, I won't mention any names of carriers. They go no, no. Look, if you put a capital structure around GB and called it an insurance company, it'd be one of the five top insurance companies probably in the world. Think about that in terms of the amount of claim work that's coming through. And our focus, and this is, I think, really key, and what we're selling and we believe proving day in and day out is if you outsource your claim work to us, whether you are a large risk management account through self-insuring or whether you're a carrier, your outcomes will be superior. And if I look at an insurance company CEO and saying, \"I think I'm worth or could help you find 2 points of ROE,\" it could be pretty dramatic.\nAndrew Kligerman: Maybe if I could just squeak one last one in on the contingent revenues. They were up 30% in the quarter. Just given it was such a great year for underwriting, do you see that kind of being flattish as we go into '24, when you provided your 7% to 9% guidance, maybe that impact becomes flattish in the scope of it all?\nDouglas Howell: No, I said it -- I would say it would be in that same 7% to 9% range. I'm not going to see it outperforming that. And yes, we were pleasantly surprised by a few extra million bucks than we thought we were going to get there.\nDouglas Howell: By the way, look through that number and see what it's telling you as a potential owner. Our book of business is superior to the competition. That's interesting, isn't it?\nAndrew Kligerman: Yes. Hey, thanks a lot. That was great insights.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nYaron Kinar: Thank you, all. Good afternoon or good evening.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi, Yaron.\nYaron Kinar: First question I have, and forgive me it's a bit nitpicky here, but in Brokerage organic, I know the organic came in-line with December guide. But I think contingents were a bit better than you were expecting. You were already accounting for the life case timing and the 606 accounting. So, it seems like there may have been something there that came in a little bit lighter than expectations? Or am I thinking about it incorrectly?\nDouglas Howell: Maybe there's $5 million less than we had hoped on a few of them. But it's -- I mean, when you're looking at a $2 billion quarter, $5 million, it does move the percentage a little bit, but it doesn't -- it's not a meaningful that we are a sales organization, I look back last year, we had 11% one quarter, we had 7% in another quarter. We had 9%, 7%, 8%. So, it bounces around a little bit. So the fact that we brought it in within a 0.5 point or what we're looking at here, you do get some bounce around for a few million bucks here or there.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then a couple of quick ones on the CFO Commentary. So, I am seeing a bit of a slowdown in Brokerage earn-out payables in 2024. Is that just the Willis Re true-up in '23?\nDouglas Howell: That's right.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. And then, I'm also seeing a meaningful increase in the amortization of intangibles and Risk Management. Are you expecting any large M&A there? Or did you already conduct...\nDouglas Howell: Yeah, we announced My Plan Manager acquisition here a month or so or two months ago. So that's the $60 million worth of revenue in that disability business down in Australia.\nYaron Kinar: Okay. Got it. Thanks so much.\nDouglas Howell: Sure. Thanks.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Yaron.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ward: Hi, guys. Thank you. Maybe just curious on Canada. I think one of your peers mentioned some headwinds there. And I think if we're interpreting the commentary, it sounds like maybe you saw a slowdown, too. Just wondering if you could talk about that dynamic if you think that should persist in '24?\nDouglas Howell: Well, listen, I think they had some -- they were posting 13 points, 14 points of organic growth. The market has shifted up there a little bit. So, I think they've been in the mid- to upper mid-single digits for the last four or five quarters. So, I don't see much of a shift going into 2024.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Let me pile on that one, if you would, Michael. First of all, Doug, you're right on. They've been killing in Canada. High upper digit organic year in and year out, and now they're about 5%. That makes perfect sense to me, given where they've been. And I think the 5% is a great number.\nDouglas Howell: Yeah. We actually had a couple of really great new business opportunity that just didn't fall our way. For some reason, they decided to stay with the incumbent. So I think that if you normalize for those a handful of items, I think they would have had -- add 3 or 4 more points to it.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Thank you. And then, in the CFO Commentary, it looked like you guys outperformed your revenue pick for 2Q '23 acquisition activity and increase the pick for first quarter for your 2Q '23 acquisition activity. Just wondering is that momentum from Buck or what's driving that?\nDouglas Howell: All right. Help me understand what you're looking at again. Tell me what you saw. I just didn't track to your question. Sorry about that.\nMichael Ward: It was just the revenue pick from 2Q '23 -- well, and you increased the 1Q '24 pick. Just sort of wondering if that was Buck from $90 million to $95 million?\nDouglas Howell: Listen, remember, every time we buy something, you're going to get maybe four quarters of this disclosure. So as Buck runs that off, we also have Cadence and Eastern that are coming on in fourth quarter '24, but that's -- you can see it there, the 2000 -- second quarter 2,000, it falls away to nothing, right? It goes -- which it would even if it were $5 million a quarter, it's $95 million. So, that is what you're seeing there. It's just the run in a Buck that's no longer M&A roll over.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Awesome. And then maybe just following up on the question from earlier. Did I hear you sort of mention for benefits growth was kind of going to be at the -- or you think it's going to be towards the bottom end of the kind of spectrum across product lines this year?\nDouglas Howell: No, I just said they might be running more like 7% versus 9% in some things next year. So that's what I said. They would be more towards that lower end of that 7% to 9% range, just on the nature of their business.\nMichael Ward: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nDouglas Howell: Pause on that a little bit. Get the medical inflation that many are starting to worry about, we might have a different answer for you on that one, that heats up.\nMichael Ward: Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question is coming from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. I think two really small ball questions. Doug, you talked about why contingents in the fourth quarter a little bit better than the December expectation. But it also sounds like you're not expecting reserve development to be a problem in 2024 if contingent organic matches core organic. Am I thinking about that right?\nDouglas Howell: No, I didn't say that. I think that on the casualty lines, I think that would impact our base commission. I don't see it really eroding our supplemental or our contingents. If we do have a reserving, again, I don't like you to use word crisis, but if there's something like that, that happens may be something that, but I don't see that eroding the contingent commission substantially next year as they take rational and orderly rate increases.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Understood. And then just -- I may have missed this. But the increasing detail on Page 6 of the commentary where you break out the individual components, should we assume that those are all, I don't know, 90%-plus margin revenue?\nDouglas Howell: No, my point was on the premium funding, there's -- the margin on that would be very similar to our Brokerage business. So that's not -- equity interest is not that big of a number. We just don't have that many 100%-owned entities on it. And then interest income, yeah, there's margin on that. But remember, interest income is to rise -- is there because there's inflation out there. We do have inflation in some of our categories like travel and entertainment, for instance, a substantial inflation in that. So if that -- if interest rates come down, then I would expect inflation on travel to come down also. So there are some offsets on it, but the premium funding business is 30 points of margin, something like that.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the clarification.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Meyer. And let me just say thank you again for joining us this afternoon. And to our 52,000-plus colleagues across the globe, thank you for another fantastic year. Our achievements are due to all of your hard work and dedication. As thrilled as I am with our fourth quarter and full year '23 performance, I get even more excited when I think about our future. We operate in an essential industry for the economy within a fragmented market, having leader data and analytics and niche expertise and limited global market share. So I believe our opportunities for future growth are immense. And while I always say, we're just getting started. It's pretty cool to be Gallagher. We look forward to seeing you at our mid-March IR Day. Thanks for being with us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

            "name": "Douglas Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our earnings release commenting on fourth quarter and full year organic and margins by segment. I'll also provide some comments on our full year '24 outlook. We'll then shift to the CFO Commentary document that we posted on our IR website where I'll provide some comments on our typical modeling helpers and then give two short vignettes, one on investment income and another as a quick refresher on earn-out payable accounting. I'll then conclude my prepared remarks with a few comments on cash, M&A and capital management. Okay. Let's flip to Page 3 of the earnings release. Headline, fourth quarter Brokerage organic of 7.2% is right in-line with our December IR Day expectation of 7% to 7.5%. But as Pat noted, we see that closer to 8.7% and organic of 11% if we were to also include interest income. That's a darn good quarter, no matter what percentage you want to focus on. A couple of other puts and takes to call out on that page. First, contingents did come in a little bit better than our December thinking due to more favorable carrier performance than we thought at that time. And second, base commission and fee organic of 6.5%. That's where you should levelize for the impact of 606 in those life cases. Controlling for those takes that over 8%. Looking ahead to '24, our Brokerage segment organic outlook is unchanged from our late October and mid-December expectations. We still see full year organic growth in that 7% to 9% range. All right. Let's flip to Page 5 of the earnings release, to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. Adjusted fourth quarter EBITDAC margin was up 48 basis points. But remember, to get to that requires recomputing last year's fourth quarter using current FX rates. We've done that in this table and is 31.3% for fourth quarter '22. So, posting a 31.6% margin this quarter gives you that 48 basis points of margin expansion, and that's right at the high end of our December IR Day expectation. Then, if you control for the role in Buck and other mergers we closed late in the quarter that have some seasonality, that would have been 150 basis points of expansion. That's simply terrific work by the team. Looking ahead to next year, we anticipate seeing some full year margin expansion starting at 4% organic. And if organic was, say, double that, maybe around 60 basis points of expansion. And note, that includes about 40 basis points of pressure against it due to the roll in of M&A, mostly Buck. On a quarterly basis, the headwind is about 80 to 90 basis points in the first quarter '24. So, please don't forget to reflect this nuance in your models. Okay. Moving to the Risk Management segment and the organic and EBITDAC tables on Pages 5 and 6. Another excellent quarter for Gallagher Bassett, 13.2% organic growth and margins at 21%. We continue to benefit from new business wins and excellent retention. Looking forward, even as we lap growth associated with some large new business wins from early '23, we see full year '24 organic in that 9% to 11% range and margins around 20%, again, that's unchanged from our December views. So, let's turn to Page 7 of the earnings release and the corporate segment shortcut table. Total segment adjusted fourth quarter numbers came in a little better than the favorable end of our December IR Day expectations due to less borrowing on our line of credit and slightly lower corporate expenses. So, now let's shift to the CFO Commentary document, to Page 3, that's where we provide many modeling helpers. Most of the fourth quarter actual numbers are very close to our December IR Day estimates. We've also now added 2024 information. So, take a look at that. In particular, as we -- take a look at FX. We are expecting a small headwind to EPS in the first half within the Brokerage segment. Now, moving to Page 4 of the CFO Commentary document, to the corporate segment outlook for full year '24. There's no change there to our full year estimate that we provided six weeks ago during our IR Day, but we are now providing quarterly estimates. So, please take some time to refine your models with us added information. When you get to Page 5, this page shows our tax credit carryforwards. You'll see what we discussed at our December IR Day. We are able to reestablish a portion of our tax credits following the change in tax method election when we filed our '22 U.S. federal tax return here in the fourth quarter. Accordingly, as of December 31, we have about $870 million of tax credits available. That's a nice future cash flow sweetener that helps us fund future M&A. So, let's turn to the new table that we put in the top of Page 6. We thought this would be helpful as we've been giving a lot of questions about our investment income line. The punchline is that this line includes items such as premium finance revenues, book gains and equity investments in third-party brokers in addition to interest income. So, this table breaks it down for you by quarter. We hope you will find this helpful. We've also renamed that line in our financial statements to clarify that it contains other items. No numbers change, we've just broadened the descriptor. So, just shifting down on that page, on Page 6, you'll see total Brokerage rollover revenue for fourth quarter was $180 million. That's consistent with our IR Day expectation. Looking forward, we've included estimated revenues for mergers closed through yesterday for the Brokerage segment in that table and for the Risk Management segment in the text below that table. Based on Brokerage and Risk Management mergers closed through yesterday, we're estimating around $540 million of rollover revenues to be recognized in '24. And also, don't forget, you'll need to make a pick for future M&A and also add interest expense as we fund a portion of those acquisitions via future borrowings. So, while I'm on the topic of M&A, as we foreshadowed in December, we did increase our estimated earn-out payable for Willis Re during the quarter because we now have good line of sight of what we might pay out in the first quarter of 2025. Remember, the accounting for earn-out payables is a bit backwards. If expectations of performance are more favorable, it creates GAAP expense. And if expectations of performance are less favorable, it creates GAAP income. That's what Pat meant when he said counterintuitive accounting. That said, we do adjust these estimate changes, but were the highlight because it does create some GAAP earnings noise. The punchline on all this and what's more important, our reinsurance business is performing extremely well. So, moving to cash, capital management and M&A funding. Available cash on hand at December 31 was about $400 million. And with another year of strong expected cash flow generation here in '24, we estimate about $3.5 billion of capacity to fund M&A in '24 using only free cash and incremental borrowings. So, those are my comments. As I reflect on '23, two metrics for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments really sum up how good our year was: revenue growth of 18%, up $1.5 billion; and adjusted EBITDAC growth of 20% or nearly $550 million. So, the team delivered another terrific year, and we all have tremendous momentum to do it again here in '24. Back to you, Pat. Well, I think when we did that in our budget process, the range of 7% to 9%, it's pretty much so what we're seeing today throughout next year is really the assumptions. Where are we today in pricing, where are we in exposure units, what we've been running here this year, we don't see a lot of change to that next year. All right. So on that point, not every business has given a flat target number, they view it based on what they're seeing in the marketplace rate, exposure, opportunities, hiring, hiring new producers. So, every business does that differently. What would I say is being different? Who's on the upper end of the range? And who's on maybe the lower end of the range? Benefits might be a little bit on the lower end of the range, and you might see reinsurance and specialty on the upper end of the range in that. But by and large, each business unit rolls it up and that's how we get to that 7% to 9% range. Effectively yes. I mean we still have to accrete that for one more year. So it might be -- I think there's $50 million of accretion that will go through the financial statements this next year. Yeah. Let me add one thing on that. I think that the organic in Cadence and Eastern was running very similar to what we're seeing in our similar geographies in similar areas. So I think your premise was that it take a while to restart them. I think they're already started. I think they're going after it. Buck is already showing terrific organic growth. We don't get it in our numbers for a year. So somebody goes out and sells something within the year, but we never get organic credit for that. And we get the revenues for it, but we don't get the organic growth credit in our numbers. So, I wouldn't say that the premise was, if the ones that we bought that they were -- they needed a restart. I think you're missing the magnitude of this. In the quarter, let's call it, $10 million, we get $15 million in total here that gets pushed out on a $10 billion business next year. Okay, it's 10 or 15 basis points in there, but so that wouldn't be enough to change that 7% to 9% guide in there. I think what we said is that over the next five or seven years, we'll need twice as many people there as we have there now. I think what's really exciting about all the work that we've done for almost two decades there now has put us in a position of being so standardized in many of the processes that we do. We now have the opportunity to unleash AI on that because that's already done. We have made that investment. And now what we can do is deploy AI against it. And, look, those folks, if you're going to hire twice as many folks, they're going to end up with better jobs over there because they're going to be using AI. So, our colleagues there are going to be well rewarded by deploying that technology into it. So, we are really fired up about it. Well, first of all, we talked about that, I think, back in our April or June call that we were probably a little further ahead at that point of the year and our incentive comp accruals. So that's been contemplated in our guidance of margin expansion since way back then. So that -- I would say there's no new news of what we were expecting in December versus what we delivered this quarter. And what's the impact of it? It's not a point. I mean, so it's not a big number. All right. So I think when you break down our organic, we usually have more net new versus lost is probably 3% to 4% on that. When you get some rate in there, probably, we're at that 2 points and maybe there's 2 points of it, that's 2 or 3 points that's exposure unit growth. I don't -- we're going to have more lift next year from new versus lost probably proportionately. So, if you break down 9%, it might be a third, a third, a third. If you break down 7%, it's probably half rate -- excuse me, mostly new business and then exposure unit growth again. All right. So you got the rate sensitivity and you've got the amount of cash that we have on our balance sheet, that's not only ours, but our clients, okay? So, first and foremost, it's both the rate that we're earning and then it's the -- on what we're earning that on. Second of all, you've got the dynamic. You mentioned the Fed. The U.S. portion of that interest income is only about 45% of the numbers. So it's actually more heavily weighted to internationally, and you would expect that with kind of large reinsurance balances in some of the large specialty businesses that we have in the U.K. So you got to separate your thinking on that. The other thing, too, is that you've got the growth as it grew this year, it was not only because of rate that was going up, but it was also because of the way the reinsurance receivables migrated from Willis' books onto our books during the transition services agreement. So you got that dynamic in it. I think what you're trying to plumb for is how sensitive is that number to rate changes. I would say that it's price-sensitive $5 million per rate cut that the Fed does in the U.S. per year. So if there's 4 points in, there's $20 million -- four cuts that might be $20 million. Again, that's just answering your question about the Fed. How the other central banks, what they do with their policy next year, I just don't have that number right off the top of my head. But when you asked about the Fed, think about it as $5 million per cut. July 1. That's correct. Yes, it's important for -- yes, okay. You've got the premium finance just to make sure you know that there's expenses associated with premium finance that's down there. So that's a spread business. But you get -- gross is up. We get the revenues up above, and then we get the -- we have the operating expenses and the interest costs down below in operational. All right. So, two things. You can see on Page 5, we have reaffirmed that we think that there'd be about $150 million worth of utilization of that balance in '24. And maybe when you get to '25, '26, '27 is somewhere around $180 million of utilization in a year. So, you need to think about it coming in over the next four years. There is a very small other balance of credits in there that I would say is a rounding there, and it has to do with when we construct our home office building. But for all intents and purposes, consider these credits to be from our clean energy work. 25 basis points. 25. They do at 25. I was referring to a rate cut of 25 basis points. No, I said it -- I would say it would be in that same 7% to 9% range. I'm not going to see it outperforming that. And yes, we were pleasantly surprised by a few extra million bucks than we thought we were going to get there. By the way, look through that number and see what it's telling you as a potential owner. Our book of business is superior to the competition. That's interesting, isn't it? Maybe there's $5 million less than we had hoped on a few of them. But it's -- I mean, when you're looking at a $2 billion quarter, $5 million, it does move the percentage a little bit, but it doesn't -- it's not a meaningful that we are a sales organization, I look back last year, we had 11% one quarter, we had 7% in another quarter. We had 9%, 7%, 8%. So, it bounces around a little bit. So the fact that we brought it in within a 0.5 point or what we're looking at here, you do get some bounce around for a few million bucks here or there. That's right. Yeah, we announced My Plan Manager acquisition here a month or so or two months ago. So that's the $60 million worth of revenue in that disability business down in Australia. Sure. Thanks. Well, listen, I think they had some -- they were posting 13 points, 14 points of organic growth. The market has shifted up there a little bit. So, I think they've been in the mid- to upper mid-single digits for the last four or five quarters. So, I don't see much of a shift going into 2024. Yeah. We actually had a couple of really great new business opportunity that just didn't fall our way. For some reason, they decided to stay with the incumbent. So I think that if you normalize for those a handful of items, I think they would have had -- add 3 or 4 more points to it. All right. Help me understand what you're looking at again. Tell me what you saw. I just didn't track to your question. Sorry about that. Listen, remember, every time we buy something, you're going to get maybe four quarters of this disclosure. So as Buck runs that off, we also have Cadence and Eastern that are coming on in fourth quarter '24, but that's -- you can see it there, the 2000 -- second quarter 2,000, it falls away to nothing, right? It goes -- which it would even if it were $5 million a quarter, it's $95 million. So, that is what you're seeing there. It's just the run in a Buck that's no longer M&A roll over. No, I just said they might be running more like 7% versus 9% in some things next year. So that's what I said. They would be more towards that lower end of that 7% to 9% range, just on the nature of their business. Pause on that a little bit. Get the medical inflation that many are starting to worry about, we might have a different answer for you on that one, that heats up. No, I didn't say that. I think that on the casualty lines, I think that would impact our base commission. I don't see it really eroding our supplemental or our contingents. If we do have a reserving, again, I don't like you to use word crisis, but if there's something like that, that happens may be something that, but I don't see that eroding the contingent commission substantially next year as they take rational and orderly rate increases. No, my point was on the premium funding, there's -- the margin on that would be very similar to our Brokerage business. So that's not -- equity interest is not that big of a number. We just don't have that many 100%-owned entities on it. And then interest income, yeah, there's margin on that. But remember, interest income is to rise -- is there because there's inflation out there. We do have inflation in some of our categories like travel and entertainment, for instance, a substantial inflation in that. So if that -- if interest rates come down, then I would expect inflation on travel to come down also. So there are some offsets on it, but the premium funding business is 30 points of margin, something like that."

            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you very much, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter '23 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had a strong fourth quarter to wrap up another fantastic year. All measures were right in line with what we said during our December IR Day. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 20% growth in revenue, headline 8.1% organic growth, but that's more like 9.4% controlling for the 606 accounting and large life case timing. We also had a terrific merger and acquisition quarter. We completed 14 mergers totaling $410 million of estimated annualized revenue. GAAP earnings per share of $0.30 and net earnings margin of 2.8% were impacted by the counterintuitive earn-out payable accounting that Doug will elaborate on in a few minutes. So, better to look at it more on a comparable basis. Adjusted earnings per share were $2.22, up 23% year-over-year, and we posted an EBITDAC margin of 30.1%, up 69 basis points over fourth quarter '22. What a terrific quarter to close out an incredibly good year by the team. When I think about our growth for the full year, we are up 18% in revenue, that's an increase of $1.5 billion. That's amazing. Moving to results on a segment basis, starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 20%. Organic headline was 7.2%, but I see it more like 8.7% without the accounting and timing noise, and 11% if you include interest income. Adjusted EBITDAC was $647 million, growing 21% year-over-year, and we posted adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 48 basis points. Let me give you some insights behind our Brokerage segment organic, and just to level set, the following does not include interest income. Our global retail P&C brokerage operations posted organic of 8%. This includes about 8% organic in the U.S., 8% in the U.K., 5% in Canada, 10% in Australia and New Zealand. Our employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of 2% or 6%, controlling for the timing of those large life cases. Shifting to reinsurance, wholesale and specialty businesses, overall organic of 14%. This includes Gallagher Re at 12%, U.S. wholesale at 12% and U.K. specialty at 16%. So, all of these are very similar to what we were seeing throughout the year. Next, let me provide some thoughts on the P/C insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Global fourth quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure changes, were up 8.5%. That's in-line with the 8% to 10% renewal premium change we have been reporting throughout '22 and '23. Renewal premium increases continue to be broad-based, up across all of our major geographies and most product lines. For example, property is up 15%, even in a slow cat property quarter. General liability is up 6%, workers' comp is up 2%, umbrella and package are each up about 10%. Shifting to the reinsurance market. 1/1 renewals were orderly reflected a more balanced supply-demand dynamic. Continued strong demand for property cat cover was met with sufficient reinsurance capacity from existing reinsurers and cat bonds. Importantly, reinsurers continue to exercise discipline on pricing and terms, not giving back the structural changes achieved last year. In casualty, while there was adequate supply, most casualty treaties experienced pricing pressure. Specialty lines renewed mostly flattish. However, coverage limitations continued on war-related products. So, in our view, insurance and reinsurance carriers continued to behave rationally, pushing for a rate where it's needed to generate an acceptable underwriting profit. Property is still needing rate. And more and more, we're hearing about the need for rate in casualty lines. If prior year development turns into a big concern, we think it could be a multiyear journey of rate increases. All that said, always remember, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases. So, not all these renewal premium increases ultimately show up in our organic. Moving to our customers' business activity. Overall, it continues to be strong. During the fourth quarter, our daily indication showed positive midyear policy endorsements and audits ahead of last year's levels. So, we are not seeing a slowdown. The same strength is also evident in the U.S. labor market with continued growth in non-farm payrolls and low unemployment rate, which is why I believe our HR consulting retirement and benefits business will have terrific opportunities in '24. As we sit here today, we are very well positioned. 2023 was a great new business year, and I believe we will continue to win new clients while retaining our existing customers. We have incredible niche expertise. Our client service is top notch, and our data and analytics continues to distance ourselves from the competition. We can handle any account of any size, anywhere around the globe. All this leads me to reaffirm that we will still see further '24 Brokerage organic in the 7% to 9% range that would lead to another outstanding year. Shifting to mergers and acquisitions. We had an excellent fourth quarter, completing 13 new brokerage mergers, representing about $350 million of estimated annualized revenue. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing family of Gallagher professionals. And we are off to a strong start to '24. We've already closed four brokerage mergers here in January for about $30 million of annualized revenue. We also have around 40 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $350 million of annualized revenue. We know not all of these will ultimately close, but we believe we'll get our fair share, clearly, a very strong pipeline. Moving on to Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Fourth quarter organic growth was terrific at 13.2%, full year at 15.8%. Adjusted fourth quarter EBITDAC margins of 21% and full year at 20%, all this right in-line with our December expectations. We also completed one merger in Australia with expected annualized revenue of about $60 million, adding new capabilities in the disability space. Looking forward, we continue to see '24 year organic in the 9% to 11% range and full year margins close to 20%, and that would be another outstanding year. And I'll conclude with some comments regarding our bedrock culture. It's a culture of client service, ethics and teamwork encapsulated in the Gallagher way. It is an unrelenting culture of excellence that helped drive full year '23 results for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments of 18% growth in revenue, of which 10% was organic. 51 mergers with nearly $900 million in estimated annualized revenue and 20% growth in adjusted EBITDAC. Most importantly, we have a culture that our people believe in, embrace and live every day. It's a huge competitive advantage and will continue to fuel our success and growth. That is the Gallagher way. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thank you, Doug. And operator, I think we can go to questions now, please. Well, I just think it makes some logical sense, at least. When you take a look back, we saw this in the property side. Nobody touched values for five, six, seven years because inflation was zero. And so you've got a bunch of reserves on the casualty side, set at those very same years that all of a sudden you come into a spike in inflation. And yes, it's been tamped down, but it's still there. And you look back at those reserves and then you take a look at these settlements that are, in fact, nuclear. And you start to say, well, all right, how well are those reserves going to hold up? Now look, I can't speak for the industry as a whole. But my sense in the meetings that we're having and discussions we're having with a number of the various carriers is that they have some concerns there that they are not necessarily comfortable with exactly where they are. And so, our view on that is, okay, if you take a look at if there were inflation in those numbers and if it were something where you had to get them right, you'd have to see price increases in order to do it. I don't think that, that's something with the kind of payout structure that you have in casualty that you need to get in one year. So, I think you're going to see possibly affirming that does, in fact, take a few years to catch up with reality. Thanks, Elyse. Thanks for being with us. Hi, Mark. Well, I think open brokerage has been where we've had the real nice run-up. I mean it's probably double to triple what's going on in the program business. So, if you look at open brokerage that running around 13% to 15%, you're probably looking at 5% on the programs. I think -- well, I mean, any change in pricing is going to have an impact on organic. But I'm not -- no, I don't see carriers at this point saying, \"Oh, the good news is I can take the price backwards.\" So, we are still seeing a push on property rate. And then you do, of course, have carriers incredibly focused on valuations. That kind of went by the wayside for years. There was no inflation, fine, 0% blah, blah, blah. Now claims are coming in, they didn't get their premium for it, the replacement costs are substantially higher than they may be predicted. And so, I think you do have a little bit of time left where there's going to be some valuation correction, and I do think there is a need for continued rate strengthening. Thanks, Mark. Thanks for being with us. Well, I'd tell you, first of all, let's remember. I think that when we do acquisitions, we like to talk about the fact that we're getting two things. We're not just getting revenue and earnings, which, of course, we want, we get. But we're getting terrific brains. And the bank-owned deals happen to be more sizable and they've got a lot of terrific people. And in addition to the brain power we're getting, we're getting expertise in the niches from the brain power, but we're also getting more volume in areas that now are spreading the brand. And it adds to that the virtuous circle of knowing about Gallagher, listening to the con-call, accepting the call. And I think what we're seeing is that our acquisition targets come aboard, and I guess this is the right way to phrase it, they kind of get on fire. It is our organic engine. There's no question about it. They come in. They've got a lot to say. Now, the bank deals are bigger. But if you take our day-in and down-out, roll-in acquisitions, these are people that more often than not have not been able to really tackle the large accounts in their own geography. In the minute they sign on to us, they're out telling those clients we're part of Gallagher, here's what we've got, let me tell you about the expertise we've got, let me show you some of the things that we do in data and analytics. You've all heard us talk about drive. What do people like you buy? What kind of limits should you have? So, we arm them with tools that they just -- whether they're in a bank or not a bank, they've never had before. So, the excitement level does not take a long time to resonate. The calls go out pretty immediately, \"Hey, did you hear that we're part of another firm.\" And these are not folks that are in any way on their back foot. They are on the front foot and moving literally at the day of closing. No, in fact, Mike, I'll tell you what we're referring to in our process is the Gallagher effect. The Gallagher effect is what happens after you announced you're part of Gallagher. It's not a slowdown, explain it. It takes their list, their pipeline of prospects and energizes the team to go back and tell about we really have something new to talk about here. And it's not just about, I know you. I've called on you many times. I've got a good relationship in the marketplace. Can I talk to you about your pricing? It's a hard market, soft market, but no, no. This is -- let me bring some data and analytics. Let me show you what's going on in our niches. We have experts in your specific area that I think you're going to want to meet. It's pretty exciting, actually. When I get a chance to get involved, it turns me on. Yeah. Let me hit a couple of other items. Why would we need to double our employee count there because we're going to double the business. And that's going to lead to plenty of opportunities there. Secondly, and I think this is a hugely important point. Standardizing a Brokerage business from an agency system through the operating processes to things like issuing certificates of insurance is a [indiscernible]. It takes four, five years to bang it through. I've done it. It's a headache. We're there. We don't need to do it. We don't need to sell it. It's standard operating procedure. When you join us, you know that in your due diligence, you come aboard, you plan the effort to change into our agency system and you get rewarded for it by virtue of the data and analytics we can provide you to go out and sell. We don't need to sell our team on that. We don't need to prove it to them. We did that 15 years ago. Hi, Dave. Thanks, David. Well, first of all, let me just say that when I look back, I can't tell you how proud I am of the team. We came into a year, new to the organization, we've got some expertise for sure that got paid, but it was very difficult a year ago. And we basically, in a tough environment, took care of our clients. And I think that's really -- we learned a lot all of us from that. And then we come around to this year, yeah, the supply and demand balance was a little easier, but what you've got now is a group of our clients that, number one, the price is up, and number two, demand is up. So, you've got pricing not coming down and people looking and saying, \"No, okay, it's not as sloppy as it was a year ago, I'd like to get more of that.\" And we saw a bunch of that at 1/1. Remember, about 45% of our business is book 1/1. So, the year when it comes to cat property is pretty much in the bank. And it's been a great year. Easier to place than last year, but as I said, demand up and pricing up. So, it still remains a very good market for us, and one in which there aren't that many people, Greg, that can do what we do for our clients. And our larger competitors are very, very good. But it falls off pretty quick after us. Thank you, Greg. Thanks for being with us. Well, I mean, first of all, I have to say that the reinsurance team has been incredibly pleased with and nicely surprised by the amount of interaction with our retail team around the world. And when we did the deal, we told the team and ourselves that we thought there was a considerable benefit from having both sides of the equation under one roof, and that is playing out over and over and over again. As you know, we're very, very strong in our niche or niche marketing, and that's a global play. And the capability to have the reinsurance perspective in those meetings, and then we're the largest player in the pooling sector for public clients in the United States. We kind of thought we had that pretty well nailed. Not a lot to learn. Our reinsurance team has added a tremendous amount of value and helped us add cover for the pools and revenue for our retailers and revenue for our reinsurance people. So, it's been an incredible two-year journey, and we're just getting started in terms of the opportunity to play together in the sandbox. What was the other question, Andrew? Facultative, but of course, now coming along with treaty clients and having our retailers -- here is an example of what you're talking about, where retailers are trying to get things done and oftentimes it's hard to place areas like property, et cetera. We are seeing our facultative opportunities grow. No, it's not brand new. But we are organizing ourselves better in the fac world. And I think we're getting -- we're in a better position today than six months ago to go out to our insurance carrier customers and our trading partners and say, \"We want to participate in this. We want to help you.\" So, we are seeing an uptick in opportunities. Well, you're seeing two things. One, our historical play in the Risk Management accounts, where you've got large accounts, you name it, whatever the large hotel chains or what have you, that are procuring our business on their accounts. And there's -- we've got a great, great year in that regard, and that includes public sector clients as well. And then as you know, we have over the last decade or so really focused on outsourcing of claims from insurance companies. And I don't have liberty on this call to name some of those because some of those carriers are pretty well-known carriers and not one that I necessarily have the approval to be touting. But from inside the organization, you look at some of these carriers you go, it's fantastic. And then, of course, the regional small companies that would like to expand that don't want to add infrastructure, they think they've got an opportunity in a given stage or geography. They don't want to be putting a lot of boots on the ground. We're picking those up as well. So, the team at GB is, in my opinion, just outperformed expectations every single year. Well, let me put it this way, Andrew. I really believe this. I believe that it will not be unusual, and I believe that people will ask. \"Did insurance companies pay their own claims? Why would they do that?\" When I sit with some of our insurance company partners and explain to them that Gallagher Bassett pays substantially more claims in numeric numbers and substantially more dollars than they do in claims by line of cover, by geography, not just in the U.S., the first reaction is oftentimes shock. And again, I won't mention any names of carriers. They go no, no. Look, if you put a capital structure around GB and called it an insurance company, it'd be one of the five top insurance companies probably in the world. Think about that in terms of the amount of claim work that's coming through. And our focus, and this is, I think, really key, and what we're selling and we believe proving day in and day out is if you outsource your claim work to us, whether you are a large risk management account through self-insuring or whether you're a carrier, your outcomes will be superior. And if I look at an insurance company CEO and saying, \"I think I'm worth or could help you find 2 points of ROE,\" it could be pretty dramatic. Thanks, Andrew. Hi, Yaron. Thanks, Yaron. Let me pile on that one, if you would, Michael. First of all, Doug, you're right on. They've been killing in Canada. High upper digit organic year in and year out, and now they're about 5%. That makes perfect sense to me, given where they've been. And I think the 5% is a great number. Thanks, Michael. Thanks, Meyer. And let me just say thank you again for joining us this afternoon. And to our 52,000-plus colleagues across the globe, thank you for another fantastic year. Our achievements are due to all of your hard work and dedication. As thrilled as I am with our fourth quarter and full year '23 performance, I get even more excited when I think about our future. We operate in an essential industry for the economy within a fragmented market, having leader data and analytics and niche expertise and limited global market share. So I believe our opportunities for future growth are immense. And while I always say, we're just getting started. It's pretty cool to be Gallagher. We look forward to seeing you at our mid-March IR Day. Thanks for being with us today."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Patrick Gallagher, Jr., Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nPatrick Gallagher: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter '23 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.  We had an excellent third quarter. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments, we posted 22% growth in revenue, 10.5% organic growth; GAAP earnings per share of $1.72, adjusted earnings per share of $2.35, up 22% year-over-year, reported net earnings margin of 15.5%, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 30.8%, up 78 basis points. We also completed 12 mergers totaling $57 million of estimated annualized revenue. Another great quarter by the team on all measures.  Before I dive into more detail about the quarter and our outlook, I want to make a comment regarding the leadership appointments that were also announced this afternoon. Tom Gallagher will assume the role of President, and Patrick Gallagher will become COO, both effective January 1, 2024. These appointments are being made to better position us for the next phase of our growth. And before you ask, I have no plans to retire. I will continue to be CEO and Chairman focused on Gallagher's strategy and global expansion.  In their future roles, Tom and Patrick will help me lead organic and merger and acquisition growth initiatives, drive operational improvement and further promote our bedrock culture across the entire organization. This is the best business on the planet. I love my job and believe we are just getting started.  Moving to results on a segment basis. Let me give you some more detail on our quarter's performance. Starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 22%. Organic was 9.3%. Acquisition rollover revenues were $153 million. Adjusted EBITDAC growth was 23%, and we posted adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of about 55 basis points.  Let me walk you around the world and provide some more detailed commentary on our brokerage organic. And just to level set versus some of our peers, the following figures do not include interest income. Starting with our retail brokerage operations. In our U.S. P/C business underlying organic growth was about 8%. New business production and retention was better than last year, while less nonrecurring construction and capital markets business was a bit of a headwind. Our U.K. P/C business posted 7% organic with new business production and retention similar to last year. Our Canadian P/C operation was up 10% organically, reflecting solid new business and retention and more modest renewal premium increases.  Rounding out the retail P/C business, our combined operations in Australia and New Zealand posted 13% organic. Core new business wins remain excellent, and renewal premium increases were ahead of third quarter '22 levels. Our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of 6% with solid health and welfare results and continued strength across many of our retirement and HR consulting practice groups.  Shifting to our reinsurance, wholesale and specialty businesses. Gallagher Re posted 20% organic, thanks to a strong 7/1 renewal season, another outstanding quarter by the team following an excellent first half. Risk Placement Services, our U.S. wholesale operations posted organic of 7%, including a couple points headwind from lower contingents. Open brokerage organic was 13% and organic was about 5% in our MGA programs and binding businesses. And finally, U.K. Specialty posted organic of 18%, benefiting from outstanding new business production, strong retention and continued firm market conditions.  Next, let me provide some thoughts on the P/C insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Global third quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure changes were up 10%. That's at the top end of the 8% to 10% renewal premium change we had been reporting throughout '22 and early '23 and very similar to second quarter renewal premiums adjusting for business mix.  Renewal premium increases remained broad-based, up across all of our major geographies and most product lines. For example, property is up more than 20%. General liability is up about 6%. Workers' comp is up about 2%. Umbrella and package are each up about 10%. Overall, the primary market continues to behave rationally in our view, with carriers pushing for rate where it's needed to generate an acceptable underwriting profit. Remember, though, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases. So not all of these premium increases ultimately show up in our organic.  Shifting to the reinsurance market. Following the orderly July 1 renewal season, all eyes are turning to January renewals. Assuming no major cat events before year-end, we believe the property reinsurance market will see adequate capacity, continued firm pricing, rising insured values and increased demand overall. When it comes to casualty, reinsurers appear to be taking a cautious view of risk. With that said, we believe adequate capacity will be available to support increased demand at firmer pricing.  Here in the U.S., our retail and reinsurance teams met with more than 25 of our key U.S. insurance carrier partners at the annual CIAB conference earlier this month. It remains a tough environment for carriers, dealing with frequency and severity of weather events, including secondary perils, pockets of unfavorable prior year development in casualty lines, higher replacement costs, social inflation and rising reinsurance costs. So we believe carriers are likely to seek out further renewal premium increases and to maintain their cautious underwriting posture.  Moving to our customers' business activity. Overall, it continues to be more resilient than headlines would suggest and we continue to characterize it as strong. During the third quarter, our daily indications showed year-over-year increases in positive midyear policy endorsements and audits. Additionally, the U.S. labor market remains strong. With continued growth in U.S. nonfarm payrolls and a wide gap between the amount of job openings and the number of people unemployed and looking for work.  We also just passed the 6-month mark of the Buck acquisition, and the team is off to a fantastic start with integration on track and financial performance in line with our expectations, and I am most pleased with how the teams have come together to better serve our clients. So I believe our HR Consulting, Retirement and Benefits business is well positioned headed into the 2024 enrollment period. So bringing it all together, as we sit here today, we see full year brokerage organic in the upper 8s and pushing towards 9%, posting that would be another fantastic year.  Let me move on to mergers and acquisitions. We had an active third quarter, completing 12 new tuck-in brokerage mergers representing about $57 million of estimated annualized revenue. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. We also recently signed definitive agreements to acquire the insurance brokerage operations of Eastern Bank and Cadence Bank, with total pro forma annualized revenue towards $275 million. Building on our success from the 2022 M&T Bank transaction, we are extremely excited about these mergers and believe these 2 regional banks have built brokerage businesses that operate and feel a lot like us.  And if that isn't exciting enough, we also have a very strong merger pipeline. Excluding these 2 pending mergers, we have around 45 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing more than $450 million of annualized revenue, and we know all of these won't ultimately close, but we believe we'll get our fair share.  Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic growth was 17.9% ahead of September expectations due to continued growth in claim counts and new business from 22 new business wins. We still expect to grow over these wins by double digits during the fourth quarter due to our superior client offerings, some smaller new business wins in '23 and continued growth in claim activity. Third quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin of 20.4% was strong and in line with our September expectation. Looking forward, we see full year '23 organic above 15% and adjusted EBITDAC margins pushing 20%, and that would be another fantastic year.  And I'll conclude with some comments regarding our bedrock culture. A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure to visit our associates in our India Gallagher Center of Excellence. It was awesome to see our team in action again. The energy, the excitement and relentless pursuit of improvement is thriving among our 10,000 colleagues. It's a huge competitive advantage for us because we can take a process, streamline and standardize it and then move it to our centers of excellence. Once there, the process is refined even further, and then we make the service available to all our geographies. At the same time, we are refining, automating, deploying robotics and using AI. We are a machine that is driving out rework, improving turnaround times and raising our quality. And remember, we don't outsource these important roles. Rather, these full-time Gallagher employees represent the very best service and support professionals who are passionate about our customers and have a culture of constant improvement, which is the Gallagher way.  Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. It was a great quarter. Doug, over to you.\nDouglas Howell: All right. Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll walk through third quarter organic and margins by segment, make some comments about how we see the fourth quarter shaping up and provide some early thoughts on full year '24. Then I'll provide some comments on our typical modeling helpers using the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website, and I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a few comments on cash, M&A and capital management.  Okay, let's flip to Page 3 of the earnings release. All-in brokerage organic of 9.3% which, as a reminder, does not include interest income like some of our peers report. Organic, including interest income would be about 12%.  A few soundbites: first, in total, we came in a little bit better than we foreshadowed at our September IR Day due to really strong results from reinsurance and London specialty; second, base commission and fee organic was strong at 9.6%; third, supplementals and contingents, together up 5%. At our IR day, we flagged some softness, mostly related to the Maui fires. Since then, we have also seen a very slight uptick in expected insurance carrier loss ratios that also had a modest unfavorable impact to organic. Regardless, 9.3% in total without interest income, 12% with, both are fantastic results for the quarter.  One special mention. Pat discussed that global renewal premium increases, we were seeing around 10% this quarter. And on the surface, it might appear this increase is a bit lower, maybe about a point from what we said in September and also from second quarter. It's important to note, when we look at our data by line and customer and then adjust for mix, the renewal premium increases for the third quarter are very similar to second quarter. So please don't interpret that there has been any meaningful shift in the market. We're just not seeing that.  Looking ahead to Q4 organic. Over the last year, we have reminded that we have an accounting headwind to overcome. Recall in Q4 '22, we booked a change in estimate related to our 606 deferred revenue accounting. That will now create a more difficult compare, called out about a point of organic headwind. Again, no new news here, but just a reminder as you update your models. Controlling for this, we see fourth quarter underlying organic growth approaching 9%, but the headline might look more like 8%. If we post that, that would mean full year brokerage organic in the upper 8s pushing towards 9%. Again, these percentages do not include interest income. What a great year that would be.  Flip now to Page 5 of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. We posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 32.4% for the quarter. That's up 55 basis points over third quarter '22's FX-adjusted margin. That's great work by the team to end up a bit better than our September IR Day expectations.  Looking at margins like a bridge from Q3 '22, organic gave us 80 points of expansion. Incremental interest income gave us 90 basis points. All-in M&A, mostly Buck which naturally runs at lower margins, impacted it by about 65 basis points. We also made incremental technology investments, called out about $7 million, and had some continued inflation on T&E, called out about $3 million, which in total used about 50 basis points. Follow that bridge and the math gets you close to that 55 basis points of FX adjusted margin expansion in the third quarter.  As for adjusted EBITDAC margin outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect about 40 to 50 basis points of expansion. And remember, that's off of fourth quarter '22 margins recomputed at current FX levels. However, unlike the past few quarters where FX created some noise, we're fortunate that now there's not much impact to consider, so much easier to model. If we deliver on that full year '23 which show margins expanding 30 to 40 basis points or 80 to 90 basis points levelizing for the roll-in impact of Buck, that would be a terrific year.  Looking ahead to next year, we are just beginning our budgeting process. And -- but our early -- very early thinking is that organic -- we're seeing organic in that 7% to 9% range. As for margins, we would anticipate seeing some margin expansion starting at 4% organic growth and perhaps if we hit 7%, call it around 50 basis points of expansion. And also, one other modeling heads up, please don't forget, first quarter '24 margins will have a slightly tougher year-over-year compare since Buck will still be rolling into our results.  Okay. Let's move on to the Risk Management segment and the organic and EBITDAC tables on Page 5 and 6, a really strong finish to the third quarter. 17.9% organic growth and margins at 20.4%. As Pat mentioned, we continue to benefit from higher claim counts related to the new business wins from the second half of '22.  Looking forward, we see organic in the fourth quarter around 13% and margins just above 20%. Organic does reflect the lapping of last year's newer large business wins and margins remain terrific. So if we deliver on that, full year organic would be above 15% and margins pushing 20%. That would be another record year for Gallagher Bassett. Looking ahead to full year '24, our early thinking is pointing towards 9% to 11% organic and margins around 20%.  Okay. Let's turn to Page 7 of the earnings release and the corporate segment shortcut table. In total, adjusted third quarter came in $0.03 better than the midpoint of the range we provided during our September IR day. Two reasons: first, lower borrowings on our line of credit and some of the M&A opportunities were pushed into October and November and second, lesser FX remeasurement headwinds.  Let's move now to the CFO commentary document to Page 3. A couple of things versus our September IR Day estimates. You'll see third quarter amortization expense is better by $7 million. But remember, this is noncash and doesn't impact adjusted EBITDAC nor adjusted EPS. This was simply due to balance sheet true-ups when we get our third-party M&A valuations. Then you'll also see depreciation is a touch higher by $2 million, but that is offset by change in acquisition earn-outs, which is lower by $2 million, so no net impact there. Looking ahead, we've updated our fourth quarter numbers and footnotes, so just do a double check of your models. And we will also update this page again during our December IR Day and give you a first look at 2024 numbers.  Flip over to Page 4 of the CFO commentary document to the corporate segment outlook for the fourth quarter. Only real movement is that Q4 interest and banking expense is up a bit, reflecting more anticipated borrowing.  Moving to Page 5. This is the page that shows our tax credit carryforwards. As of September 30, we have about $670 million available, a nice future cash flow sweetener that helps fund future M&A.  When you turn to Page 6, you'll see the rollover revenue table for third quarter -- the rollover revenues for the third quarter were $153 million, that's a little better than our IR Day expectation, mostly due notably to 1 merger that really hit it out of the park during the second half of September. It really shows you the potential upside mergers can see after joining Gallagher.  Looking forward, we have included estimated revenues for M&A closed and announced through yesterday. That's important to note these numbers already include expected revenues from Eastern and Cadence. We've assumed a mid-fourth quarter closing date, so please don't double count. And also, as we always say, please don't forget, you need to make a pick for future M&A also.  In terms of funding M&A, first, available cash on hand at September 30 was around $550 million. Second, our fourth quarter is historically a very strong cash flow quarter. Third, we currently have nothing outstanding on our line of credit, so we can use that or do a bond offering. And finally, if we close a lot of the tuck-in M&A pipeline that Pat discussed, before year-end, we may use a small amount of stock, but call it a couple of hundred million dollars.  As we consider these alternatives, we're always being very mindful of maintaining our solid investment-grade rating also. As for 2024, we are currently estimating about $3.5 billion of capacity to fund future M&A using only free cash and incremental borrowings.  Okay. Those are my comments, another fantastic quarter by the team. It's looking like another fantastic year. Congratulations to Patrick and Tom on their new roles. We have terrific momentum taking us into '24. Back to you, Pat.\nPatrick Gallagher: Okay. I think we're ready for some questions and answers. Operator, will you open it up?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs.\nRobert Cox: Thanks for the outlook on the organic growth for 2024. Just curious, you had previously mentioned that you didn't think there would be that much of a difference in sort of the different areas within the business growing at different rates. Curious if you have any updated thoughts on how different businesses may perform in 2024 versus 2023.\nDouglas Howell: Rob, thanks for that. I think let us get through the budget process here, we'll have more for you at our December IR day. But right now, we're not seeing anything significantly different kind of across the portfolio of operations, but it's going to roll up somewhere into that 7% to 9% range as we're looking at it now.\nRobert Cox: Okay. Got it. And then just on the 2024 margin expansion of 50 bps. If you could achieve 7%, just curious on if that includes impacts from investment income or maybe a potential slight uplift from some of these higher-margin acquisitions you've done recently?\nDouglas Howell: All right. So 3 things in there on that. Right now, the way I got to that number, doesn't assume much incremental lift from investment income. It does assume a little bit of a drag from one quarter of Buck rolling into our numbers that naturally runs lower margins. But by and large, maybe those 2 offset each other a little bit. And maybe there's a little extra roll-in impact from M&A from Buck. The rest of the M&A that we're planning on in our outlook for next year comes in pretty close to the same margins that we're at.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.\nElyse Greenspan: My first question, reinsurance. Pat, you guys said 20% organic growth in the quarter. That's the strongest you guys have printed since you closed that deal. Obviously, Q3 is smaller from a revenue perspective, but I was hoping, is there more within that number? And then when you guys are guiding to 7% to 9% next year, I mean, what are you assuming just in terms of the momentum and the growth within that reinsurance business?\nPatrick Gallagher: That's a good question, Elyse. I think as Doug said earlier, we're just in the throes now of budgeting, and I'd have to say that the reinsurance team has outperformed our expectations. They came aboard and have just continued to do an unbelievable job. And that 20% does include new business and great retention. So when I look forward, I'm not going to comment on rate. I'm not there yet. I got to get their professional view as we get into the budget. But I think that the business momentum will be good. I think retention will continue to be very, very strong. So would I tell you that I think we're going to see 20% organic next year? I don't know. That would be awfully hard. But I'm really -- this is a good business for us.  The market there, similar to what we're seeing on retail, we are not seeing softening. As we said in our prepared remarks, there's capacity, but you're going to pay for it. And I don't think that's going to change between 1/1 and 7/1 next year. So I think that what you've got is kind of an interesting market. And again, this is -- if nothing happens in the cat world. So I'm not trying to waffle you. I don't have a really good clear answer for you at this point.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. Same thing I said to Rob. I said let's give you that -- let's give more flavor by division in December. That will be -- we'll be talking to you again in 6 weeks.\nElyse Greenspan: And then a good problem to have, the results there have been really strong. I know there's an earn-out associated with that transaction. Is that something that you would account for in '25? Or is that something that's already been accounted for?\nDouglas Howell: I think we'll have -- okay, the way it works is that we'll have to -- it gets triggered off a full year '24 revenues because it's heavily skewed towards 1/1 renewals, I think we'll have a pretty good estimate of where we sit here before December. So I think I'll be able to give you a number on what we think we're going to end up booking for acquisition earn-out. Now we adjust that out, but I think I should have a good number by our December IR day, and then that would be paid out in the first quarter or second quarter of '25.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then the M&A pipeline sounds still pretty robust. Doug, you mentioned that some deals were pushed into October and November. Are those the Eastern and the Cadence transactions? Or are there other transactions that were pushed from a timing perspective that could be forthcoming?\nDouglas Howell: I would say that it would be more so the Eastern transaction and it wasn't necessarily pushed. We had to file an HSR on that. So really, our early estimates of maybe getting it done in September might have been a little optimistic on that. But I wouldn't -- there's nothing else that you don't know about, let me put it that way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.\nJon Newsome: Congratulations on the quarter. I want to ask a little bit more about the M&A environment. Is there anything to be read here that there's going to be these big deals are coming out of banks. And maybe just some thoughts, if you have any about sort of how the buyers may be changing in this environment. I think we've been waiting for shifts in the market, but at least I've been sort of surprised at how they sort of happened or not happened in the last couple of quarters. But love your thoughts on that.\nPatrick Gallagher: Well, I'll give you some and then Doug can make some comments as well. I do think, and we've said this before, that some of the competition relative to some of the private equity stuff is a little bit less robust. There is still plenty of competition. And if you put a nice piece of property out for bid, you're going to get a lot of bids. So there's good competition for these good properties.  I can't get into the strategy of the banks as to by their deciding now is the time to exit, and we've seen that across a broad base. And I think it's probably because multiples are at very, very solid high levels. And whether thinks that those multiples may, at some point in time, begin to diminish, I'm not sure. But we've had incredible success with our friends at M&T. We're very excited about Eastern and Cadence. And frankly, if there's other banks that are looking in that direction, we're a very good place to look.  In terms of other M&A opportunities, you've got 30,000 agents and brokers across America. A good number of them are still owned and run by baby boomers. They're good businesses. This has been a very robust time for them. The last 5 years have been outstanding for them. A lot of change going on in our market, an awful lot of data and analytics that they can't compete with. Now you have the advent of AI, which is coming on stronger and faster than I think any of us thought. And I think people look at it and say, maybe it's time to check who's out there. Maybe now it's not a bad time for me to look. And when you take a look at our pipeline, we gave you some numbers today. I mean, it's just incredibly robust.\nJon Newsome: And then completely shifting to a different topic, if I could. There's been some comments this quarter, I think about the shift back and forth between excess lines and especially in the standard carriers. And I was wondering if from your perspective, you're seeing any of that shift back to the standard carrier. Is there really anything that's major from a terms and conditions environment sort of excluding pricing?\nPatrick Gallagher: No, we're not. I mean, the stuff that's in the E&S market has gone there for a reason, and that is growing every single month in terms of 15%, 20%. Our submissions at RPS are up substantially this year. We measure that every day, frankly. And our submissions into RPS, our wholesaling operation, are at an all-time high. Property, in particular, is a big driving line for sure, and there just is a lack of capacity, and it is getting -- it continues to be -- whoever can tell the best story might just get a quote. So no, I'm not seeing -- and we are not seeing terms and conditions soften while things still stay in the excess market. And we're not seeing business flow back to the primaries.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James.\nCharles Peters: Pat, I feel like you have been saying you feel like you're just getting started for over 20 years now. So I guess no change there. Can we go back to your comments on the bank acquisitions. And I think you said some of the banks Cadence and Eastern are getting solid high multiples for those businesses. I think those were your words. And I look at the CFO commentary, and it looks like the -- you're -- inside that you're looking for -- your multiples are paying are 10 to 11x EBITDAC. Is that inclusive of Cadence and Eastern because it feels like those numbers were -- multiples for those businesses were a little bit higher.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. Typically, what we do is for a larger transaction like that, and we have a couple of -- 1 a year or something like that, we typically exclude that. The purpose of that disclosure is really showing you what we're seeing in the tuck-ins. The reality is, is we're still seeing great opportunities, a little north of 10x, maybe sometimes you get 1 at 12, some at 10. But there's a really -- there's a ton of tuck-in opportunities that are still realizing there's terrific value in that 10% to 12% range. And the reason why is they understand that they have careers inside of Gallagher afterwards. Their employees and their producers and themselves have great careers inside of Gallagher. So what a terrific thing? Sell your business at 10 to 12x, come in and work, take on increasing responsibilities, double your agency or your location.  So the reason why we can still be effective buyers at 10 to 12x is the future opportunity of getting better together. We set it for 20 years since I've been here. When 1 plus 1 is equal 3, 4 and 5, that's what they're seeing. So we continue to click those off day in and day out kind of in those multiple ranges.\nCharles Peters: Okay. That makes sense. And then on those -- the larger transactions, it doesn't seem like -- maybe I'm -- I don't know the answer. So is there a lot of synergies to be harvested from as you integrate the businesses? Or are the stand-alone teams sort of like what you got with the WTW reinsurance operations.\nDouglas Howell: I think with Eastern and Cadence, I mean, it's not a -- there's no -- there's very few human synergies to be gained on this. As a matter of fact, they do a really great job servicing their customers and selling the insurance. But there are efficiencies that can be gained through a common general ledger, a common agency management system only needing 1 cyber protocol that runs over your platform. So there are some synergies there. But those are in the $3 million, $4 million, $5 million type numbers, not in the $25 million, $30 million or $40 million type number.\nPatrick Gallagher: The real kicker there, Greg, is that look at these bigger deals run by banks, and this is why we say it very much feels like we're buying somebody similar to us. These are firms that were rolled up by the bank, typically good community people. I've heard 3 separate outreaches from Cadence people in the last 2 days that I've known in 1 instance that they came in to kick the tires with us in 1998. And I remember the guy wrote to me and he goes, \"Hey, I came with Shorty and I remember Shorty and I came with Jim, I remember Jim and I can't tell you how excited we are.\" Now what we're bringing to them that Cadence could never do is that whole discussion of moving upstream.  We can show you statistically that our closing rate on bigger deals, and I'm not talking risk management, huge accounts. I'm just saying the bigger deals that are generating over $125,000 to $150,000 of commission are significantly greater today than they were 5 or 10 years ago. This is what we're giving them the opportunity to go after. They're typical agents in these banks that look just like everybody else, and now they're going to go out. And frankly, they're going to have our tools and they're terrifically excited about it. So that's, I think, the whole synergy thing. This is not take out headcount. This is turn them on, show them what we do, give them the tools and watch them eat the market all around them.\nCharles Peters: Okay. That makes sense. I guess the final question, I know -- I think it was Paul who was trying to get at this. But frankly, we're hearing of some stress in some of the PE-backed roll-ups where the combination of higher interest costs and earn-outs are pressuring their free cash flow. What's your view of some of those smaller entities that might be having problems? Could we see you be interested in some of those properties at some point in time if they should become available?\nPatrick Gallagher: Well, here's the thing. First of all, Greg, we'll look at every single opportunity we can. And our first question every single time is what's the culture. What was it that went into this group. In most of these, there are situations where we didn't succeed in buying something they bought. Let's talk about that around this table, not with them in the room. XYZ didn't sell to us. Why is that? Okay, fine. What's left there? And yes, I would say that there are some of those that we would be interested in. But we'd have to get through this whole cultural piece. When you chose not to join Gallagher, I'll tell you the one main reason why you chose not to join Gallagher is because you didn't want change.  And our competition has done a very good job of saying, \"Hey, why join Gallagher when I'll give you the money? I'm going to give you the cash, keep some in. Our returns have been terrific. You'll get a second bite on the apple and you don't need to change anything. You don't need to change your name, you don't need to change your agency system,\" and while they've been doing that, we've been building power-to-power, data, analytics, capabilities and vertical strength. They've got none of that. And now it's coming to roost with higher interest rates and tougher earnouts, and you got to make do -- you got to come due on your promises. So yes, we'd look at them. But we're going to have to fall in love.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets.\nMichael Zaremski: Maybe I missed this, but on the Cadence deal, is it -- am I right looking at the revenue and EBITDA disclosure that Cadence has a 36% to 37% margin, which is pretty great. And then also on the deal there was -- you called out tax benefits. I don't recall you guys calling out tax benefits in the past.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. All right. First, you're right. I think it might be about 34%, but I think [indiscernible] over a point or 2 on that. I think that when it comes to the tax, I think it's important on these margins, we always get a step-up in basis on smaller deals, but on many larger mergers that these sellers are not willing to allow a step up in basis. In this case, the sellers were willing to and we paid a little bit more cash upfront on it. But we're going to get $250 million worth of deductions over the next 15 years. Your present value that back at 5% or 6%, you get something . So it really doesn't impact them all that much because I don't know if they're -- they might be able to shield it with NOL carryforwards or something like that, but it benefits us a lot.  So to be able to achieve that. And it's not all that important in many times for, let's say, a PE firm that buys a bigger one over at trades because they've got the large interest shield coming off of the high levels of debt they run there. But for us to be able to negotiate that benefit and to be able to have a seller that's willing to allow that benefit to pass out, that makes a big difference. So in this case, this is a true win-win for them. They get more cash, we get more cash, and it brings our multiple down considerably on it.  This is not using our clean energy credit. We have $670 million of clean energy credits available. Think about that. We'll use those over the next few years. It's almost like we have another free Cadence coming our way because of those tax credits. So tax does matter. And in this case, we think that a conservative view of that benefit is $150-some million.\nMichael Zaremski: Interesting. And I guess this one probably for -- this one question is for Pat, and congrats to Thomas and Patrick on our new appointments. Just curious on Pat. Will these new appointments cause any of your existing managers other than yourself to share responsibilities they didn't previously share?\nPatrick Gallagher: There will be some follow-on promotions. Sure. There's good opportunities for everybody at Gallagher, yes.\nMichael Zaremski: And so were these promotions well-telegraphed? Or is this kind of like -- were these promotions like about well-telegraphed, like within the firm, like over time or were these kind of...\nPatrick Gallagher: I'm going to ask you the Gallagher answer. There's not a lot secret at Gallagher, right? Yes, I would say that these moves have been telegraphed over about 20 years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist Securities.\nMark Hughes: On the -- could you give any guidance on the corporate segment profit for 2024. Any early thoughts there?\nDouglas Howell: We haven't. And can you give until December? I know you're trying to figure out your '24 models. You might want to take what we did this year and just take it by line by line and make a site pick on it to see what you think it -- what would happen there. I know it's really difficult to do, Mark, because of FX remeasurement gains. I know we put some acquisition costs through there that can be lumpy. And there's a lot of tax, restructure numbers that run through there as we implement tax planning strategy. I know it's really difficult. But if you could you just give me until December and I can get that to you.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Yes.\nDouglas Howell: We get this every year.\nMark Hughes: Any thoughts on medical inflation? Just curious to get, I think, the benefit is being helped by higher health care costs for employees, but the medical inflation impact on, say, workers' comp or GL.\nPatrick Gallagher: It's interesting you should ask because we were talking about that with the board this week. And yes, we're seeing a lot of pressure on medical costs. Full insured renewals at our largest carriers are showing 7% to 9% increases right now as we speak. When you start to take retentions and you start to get in the stop-loss market, we're seeing averages there closer to 17% to 18%. That's on premium now. That's not on the underlying costs. But that's because more of the claims are tagging those carriers. So they're not only trying to move away in terms of the low end of the cost, but also they're having to pay that. So if you take a look at all of it, all in, Mark, I'd say that our numbers that we're seeing are about 8% to 9% and that's embedded both in work comp as well as health insurance across the United States.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Motemaden: I was wondering if you could just help me think through just how much of the organic growth over the last several years and even this quarter is driven by just the macro environment versus what you guys have been doing behind the scenes to accelerate share gains? Because it feels like there's been a lot going on to help you guys gain share and that the share gains are accelerating.  So I'm just wondering as kind of a big picture question. as you guys head into next year and you think about that 7% to 9% organic, I guess, how much of that do you think is coming from market share gains as you guys continue to execute versus like rate and exposure improvements?\nPatrick Gallagher: Well, let me split the question with Doug in this regard. Let me talk about market gains in terms of share gain and then he can tear the numbers a bit. But we're seeing and we're measuring this literally every single day, every month. We know now where we're producing business. We know, for instance, that 90% of the time, we compete with somebody smaller than we are. We know exactly what's happening in our verticals. We have 32 verticals that we're very, very clear on management expectation, knowing what's going on, building products and what have you. That's in the property casualty arena. We have another 7 or 8 in benefits. And in those verticals, we know that our growth rate is substantially greater than what is in our just general book of business. So internally, we know that we are taking definite share in those verticals. And I would probably -- I'd throw out a number, Mike, maybe you throw a number out on the table of what...\nDouglas Howell: In terms of?\nPatrick Gallagher: Just in terms of the growth rate in the vertical as opposed to general.\nDouglas Howell: 92% of our new business.\nPatrick Gallagher: 19% of our new business falls...\nDouglas Howell: Into one of our verticals.\nPatrick Gallagher: In one of those -- 19?\nDouglas Howell: 92%.\nPatrick Gallagher: 92, that's what I thought. I heard 19, I apologize. So each of those are growing faster than the general book. So value -- again, you've got to look at rate, you've got to look at exposure and all that other stuff. But when you talk about share, there is absolutely no doubt you go back to Doug's comment. An acquisition can be 1 plus 1 equals 5 because when Gallagher shows up with the relationships and the capabilities of the local broker and brings those relationships together with what we have as capabilities and the culture works, we don't have to force sharing on people. The fact that they can pick up the phone and say, \"I've got a college University. I've never worked on one before. Can somebody help me.\"  We will swarm that opportunity. We will write that college University they'll get their fair share, everybody wins, and we're not fighting that as a local entrepreneur who doesn't want to play with the big boys. That's the excitement. So I know that's a long-winded weird way of saying it, but we are definitely taking share. To the numbers, Doug, I'd throw over to you.\nDouglas Howell: [indiscernible] that 7% organic growth next year, I'd say that half comes from net new business wins or taking share. I would say, 1/4 is coming from exposure units and another quarter is coming from rate. If you got 9%, you probably got 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in there.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. That's really helpful. I appreciate that. And then maybe just a follow-up. We've seen obviously the 2 -- the Cadence and Eastern deals on top of the M&T Bank broker last year or earlier this year. So I guess I'm sort of wondering -- as we think about the sustainability of that organic, I know you're the preferred provider for I think it was Cadence. But I guess, how do you manage the fact that -- or the potential that there might be more of like an open process for some of those existing customers now that it's not wholly owned. I don't know if that's something that you guys have worked through planning? Or just maybe help us think through that.\nPatrick Gallagher: I'll help you think through it and probably the people from Cadence Bank and say, he's maybe talking off the top of the head, blah, blah, blah. But I don't think the bank did much to help them produce insurance, like probably hurt their production, which is why when you look at some of these deals, the Board goes well, where is the growth. Cadence and Eastern good growth, but the fact is -- those people have gone out and scrape for that business around the bank relationship, which was, of course, when they bought those firms, supposed to be the golden nugget in terms of being able to produce business that just isn't true. In fact, I think we're going to unleash an opportunity to really grow the top line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.\nMeyer Shields: Two big picture questions. One, there's been some press about larger insurance brokers getting back into wholesale. Would that matter at all to Gallagher?\nPatrick Gallagher: Not really. If you take a look at our wholesale business, RPS. We do not mandate inside Gallagher, so it's not 100% Gallagher placements there. We did consolidate down to a smaller number of players and RPS does about 50% of Gallagher's placements. So we're very cognizant of what the world is like out there. But really, RPS trades with 15,000 to 18,000 independent agents. And RPS does not trade particularly at all with our 3 larger competitors. So if they were the ones that choose to come in back into the market, we think it would have virtually no impact on us at all.\nMeyer Shields: That's very helpful. Second question, and this relates to what you've been talking about, Pat, with the additional resources that being part of Gallagher brings. How rapidly can acquisitions take advantage of that? And is that something we should factor in when we're modeling acquired revenues?\nPatrick Gallagher: Day 1, and I do mean day 1 and the team will swarm that opportunity. Now do they get used to operating that way? Have they got the customer teed up. It takes -- it's still a learning curve in all fairness, they'll call and we'll jump on the plane and have a shot at that university. But it will probably be a year or 2 before we land it. So I can't sit here and go, day 1, it just ratchets up. But I'll tell you what it does. It gets everybody in that firm excited. It worked. Gallagher helped, you can't believe it. We turned this risk manager on their head. This is really cool. Next time around, what's the strategy? What's the methodology. So the resources are truly available to that team on day 1. Now would I factor into the earn-out. Some of them take great advantage of it and really does help. It makes their earnout. Others, as I said, it's a longer ramp-up speed and it's just a matter of the individual leaders.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. One thing, I think we actually understate true organic because we don't consider any new business, net new business wins by those mergers in the first year. That doesn't get counted as organic. Was it $20 million, $30 million more of net new maybe across the business every year? I don't know. It might be worth 20 basis points on our organic growth over the course of the year. So I think it naturally understates it. But I think the point is, like I said on this one just a minute ago. We had a merger partner that just crushed it here at the end of September, and that doesn't go into organic, but it sure impacts our acquisition revenues. Now we try to give you that when we do these projections.  So look at that on Page 6 of our CFO commentary. But the point is the great mergers are the ones that come in, hit the ground running, use our resources and capabilities. And next thing you know over the next 2, 3, 4 years, they're just hitting it out of the park.\nPatrick Gallagher: We've showed you in our IR Day, things like our drive, just Gallagher Drive. One, just one item that is so cool to these people. And it's basically the ability to sit with a client and say, people like you buy this. And here's what the lines of insurance are there going to these types of truckers in your area or construction companies or senior living. Here's the layers that they're buying. And by the way, you're holding a $10 million liability limit. Most of your competitors are paying 20 -- or buying $20 million of umbrella. Let me show you the losses we have in our book that appears to $10 million. You probably ought to buy the 20, there's reason for that. It blows the competition away and our merger partners can't wait to get their hands on it. That's 1 thing, and there's a dozen of those.\nOperator: Our last question is coming from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies.\nYaron Kinar: I apologize, I had some technical difficulties. So I hope I'm not asking stuff that's already been asked. With regards to Eastern and Cadence, do they have any different seasonal patterns? I think you touched on growth on the margin profile. But I'm curious if that margin profile kind of holds true to what you see in brokers already throughout the year.\nPatrick Gallagher: No, there's no seasonality.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. Remember, we're seasonally larger primarily because of our benefits and because of our reinsured business, our P&C business is fairly steady throughout the year over the 4 quarters. And maybe it's 23% on one quarter and 27% another, but we're not getting the wild swings like you do in reinsurance and employee benefits.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. And do either of those deals fall any vertical space that you were looking to boost stop? Or is it more of a geographic play? What's the rationale there?\nPatrick Gallagher: Mike, go ahead.\nMichael Pesch: Yes, this is Mike Pesch. So I would say both of them are -- in their geographies are strong where we are maybe strong in other industries. So in Cadence, in their perspective, we do a lot of public entity in the mid-south region, and that's not one of their strengths. But they do a lot in construction and manufacturing. So it complements us really, really well. It's one of the reasons we like them so much. Eastern is the same way. If you look in New England, New England is heavily weighted towards life sciences, technology and D&O, and they balance that book considerably with a lot of other industry verticals, including construction. So it is very much a complementary business to each of those areas.\nYaron Kinar: Got it. And then one quick one to end up. Corporate expenses were quite high this quarter. Were there any one-offs there?\nDouglas Howell: I think when you look at it, if you look at the adjustment -- if you look at it on an adjusted basis, there were some tax and litigation items when we adjusted that out. On an adjusted basis, it's kind of noisy. Comp might be up $3 million or $4 million. I think we're a little further ahead on our corporate bonus accruals than we have been in the past. And when you look at operating expense, it looks down considerably on an adjusted basis, but that's the FX remeasurement gains that you're seeing. So if you're looking at it on a pretax basis on an unadjusted basis, that's what you'll see in there. But there's nothing fundamentally underlying our expense structure in the corporate segment.\nPatrick Gallagher: Well, thank you again, everyone, for joining us this evening. To our 50,000 colleagues across the globe, thank you for your hard work this quarter and every quarter. Our operational and financial success is a direct reflection of your efforts. And as pleased as I am with our third quarter performance, I'm even more excited about our future, future organic prospects, future M&A opportunities and our ability to become more productive and increase quality. We look forward to speaking with the investment community in person at our IR Day in December. Thank you again, everybody, and have a good evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter '23 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions.  We had an excellent third quarter. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments, we posted 22% growth in revenue, 10.5% organic growth; GAAP earnings per share of $1.72, adjusted earnings per share of $2.35, up 22% year-over-year, reported net earnings margin of 15.5%, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 30.8%, up 78 basis points. We also completed 12 mergers totaling $57 million of estimated annualized revenue. Another great quarter by the team on all measures.  Before I dive into more detail about the quarter and our outlook, I want to make a comment regarding the leadership appointments that were also announced this afternoon. Tom Gallagher will assume the role of President, and Patrick Gallagher will become COO, both effective January 1, 2024. These appointments are being made to better position us for the next phase of our growth. And before you ask, I have no plans to retire. I will continue to be CEO and Chairman focused on Gallagher's strategy and global expansion.  In their future roles, Tom and Patrick will help me lead organic and merger and acquisition growth initiatives, drive operational improvement and further promote our bedrock culture across the entire organization. This is the best business on the planet. I love my job and believe we are just getting started.  Moving to results on a segment basis. Let me give you some more detail on our quarter's performance. Starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 22%. Organic was 9.3%. Acquisition rollover revenues were $153 million. Adjusted EBITDAC growth was 23%, and we posted adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of about 55 basis points.  Let me walk you around the world and provide some more detailed commentary on our brokerage organic. And just to level set versus some of our peers, the following figures do not include interest income. Starting with our retail brokerage operations. In our U.S. P/C business underlying organic growth was about 8%. New business production and retention was better than last year, while less nonrecurring construction and capital markets business was a bit of a headwind. Our U.K. P/C business posted 7% organic with new business production and retention similar to last year. Our Canadian P/C operation was up 10% organically, reflecting solid new business and retention and more modest renewal premium increases.  Rounding out the retail P/C business, our combined operations in Australia and New Zealand posted 13% organic. Core new business wins remain excellent, and renewal premium increases were ahead of third quarter '22 levels. Our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of 6% with solid health and welfare results and continued strength across many of our retirement and HR consulting practice groups.  Shifting to our reinsurance, wholesale and specialty businesses. Gallagher Re posted 20% organic, thanks to a strong 7/1 renewal season, another outstanding quarter by the team following an excellent first half. Risk Placement Services, our U.S. wholesale operations posted organic of 7%, including a couple points headwind from lower contingents. Open brokerage organic was 13% and organic was about 5% in our MGA programs and binding businesses. And finally, U.K. Specialty posted organic of 18%, benefiting from outstanding new business production, strong retention and continued firm market conditions.  Next, let me provide some thoughts on the P/C insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Global third quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure changes were up 10%. That's at the top end of the 8% to 10% renewal premium change we had been reporting throughout '22 and early '23 and very similar to second quarter renewal premiums adjusting for business mix.  Renewal premium increases remained broad-based, up across all of our major geographies and most product lines. For example, property is up more than 20%. General liability is up about 6%. Workers' comp is up about 2%. Umbrella and package are each up about 10%. Overall, the primary market continues to behave rationally in our view, with carriers pushing for rate where it's needed to generate an acceptable underwriting profit. Remember, though, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases. So not all of these premium increases ultimately show up in our organic.  Shifting to the reinsurance market. Following the orderly July 1 renewal season, all eyes are turning to January renewals. Assuming no major cat events before year-end, we believe the property reinsurance market will see adequate capacity, continued firm pricing, rising insured values and increased demand overall. When it comes to casualty, reinsurers appear to be taking a cautious view of risk. With that said, we believe adequate capacity will be available to support increased demand at firmer pricing.  Here in the U.S., our retail and reinsurance teams met with more than 25 of our key U.S. insurance carrier partners at the annual CIAB conference earlier this month. It remains a tough environment for carriers, dealing with frequency and severity of weather events, including secondary perils, pockets of unfavorable prior year development in casualty lines, higher replacement costs, social inflation and rising reinsurance costs. So we believe carriers are likely to seek out further renewal premium increases and to maintain their cautious underwriting posture.  Moving to our customers' business activity. Overall, it continues to be more resilient than headlines would suggest and we continue to characterize it as strong. During the third quarter, our daily indications showed year-over-year increases in positive midyear policy endorsements and audits. Additionally, the U.S. labor market remains strong. With continued growth in U.S. nonfarm payrolls and a wide gap between the amount of job openings and the number of people unemployed and looking for work.  We also just passed the 6-month mark of the Buck acquisition, and the team is off to a fantastic start with integration on track and financial performance in line with our expectations, and I am most pleased with how the teams have come together to better serve our clients. So I believe our HR Consulting, Retirement and Benefits business is well positioned headed into the 2024 enrollment period. So bringing it all together, as we sit here today, we see full year brokerage organic in the upper 8s and pushing towards 9%, posting that would be another fantastic year.  Let me move on to mergers and acquisitions. We had an active third quarter, completing 12 new tuck-in brokerage mergers representing about $57 million of estimated annualized revenue. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. We also recently signed definitive agreements to acquire the insurance brokerage operations of Eastern Bank and Cadence Bank, with total pro forma annualized revenue towards $275 million. Building on our success from the 2022 M&T Bank transaction, we are extremely excited about these mergers and believe these 2 regional banks have built brokerage businesses that operate and feel a lot like us.  And if that isn't exciting enough, we also have a very strong merger pipeline. Excluding these 2 pending mergers, we have around 45 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing more than $450 million of annualized revenue, and we know all of these won't ultimately close, but we believe we'll get our fair share.  Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Third quarter organic growth was 17.9% ahead of September expectations due to continued growth in claim counts and new business from 22 new business wins. We still expect to grow over these wins by double digits during the fourth quarter due to our superior client offerings, some smaller new business wins in '23 and continued growth in claim activity. Third quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin of 20.4% was strong and in line with our September expectation. Looking forward, we see full year '23 organic above 15% and adjusted EBITDAC margins pushing 20%, and that would be another fantastic year.  And I'll conclude with some comments regarding our bedrock culture. A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure to visit our associates in our India Gallagher Center of Excellence. It was awesome to see our team in action again. The energy, the excitement and relentless pursuit of improvement is thriving among our 10,000 colleagues. It's a huge competitive advantage for us because we can take a process, streamline and standardize it and then move it to our centers of excellence. Once there, the process is refined even further, and then we make the service available to all our geographies. At the same time, we are refining, automating, deploying robotics and using AI. We are a machine that is driving out rework, improving turnaround times and raising our quality. And remember, we don't outsource these important roles. Rather, these full-time Gallagher employees represent the very best service and support professionals who are passionate about our customers and have a culture of constant improvement, which is the Gallagher way.  Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. It was a great quarter. Doug, over to you. Okay. I think we're ready for some questions and answers. Operator, will you open it up? That's a good question, Elyse. I think as Doug said earlier, we're just in the throes now of budgeting, and I'd have to say that the reinsurance team has outperformed our expectations. They came aboard and have just continued to do an unbelievable job. And that 20% does include new business and great retention. So when I look forward, I'm not going to comment on rate. I'm not there yet. I got to get their professional view as we get into the budget. But I think that the business momentum will be good. I think retention will continue to be very, very strong. So would I tell you that I think we're going to see 20% organic next year? I don't know. That would be awfully hard. But I'm really -- this is a good business for us.  The market there, similar to what we're seeing on retail, we are not seeing softening. As we said in our prepared remarks, there's capacity, but you're going to pay for it. And I don't think that's going to change between 1/1 and 7/1 next year. So I think that what you've got is kind of an interesting market. And again, this is -- if nothing happens in the cat world. So I'm not trying to waffle you. I don't have a really good clear answer for you at this point. Well, I'll give you some and then Doug can make some comments as well. I do think, and we've said this before, that some of the competition relative to some of the private equity stuff is a little bit less robust. There is still plenty of competition. And if you put a nice piece of property out for bid, you're going to get a lot of bids. So there's good competition for these good properties.  I can't get into the strategy of the banks as to by their deciding now is the time to exit, and we've seen that across a broad base. And I think it's probably because multiples are at very, very solid high levels. And whether thinks that those multiples may, at some point in time, begin to diminish, I'm not sure. But we've had incredible success with our friends at M&T. We're very excited about Eastern and Cadence. And frankly, if there's other banks that are looking in that direction, we're a very good place to look.  In terms of other M&A opportunities, you've got 30,000 agents and brokers across America. A good number of them are still owned and run by baby boomers. They're good businesses. This has been a very robust time for them. The last 5 years have been outstanding for them. A lot of change going on in our market, an awful lot of data and analytics that they can't compete with. Now you have the advent of AI, which is coming on stronger and faster than I think any of us thought. And I think people look at it and say, maybe it's time to check who's out there. Maybe now it's not a bad time for me to look. And when you take a look at our pipeline, we gave you some numbers today. I mean, it's just incredibly robust. No, we're not. I mean, the stuff that's in the E&S market has gone there for a reason, and that is growing every single month in terms of 15%, 20%. Our submissions at RPS are up substantially this year. We measure that every day, frankly. And our submissions into RPS, our wholesaling operation, are at an all-time high. Property, in particular, is a big driving line for sure, and there just is a lack of capacity, and it is getting -- it continues to be -- whoever can tell the best story might just get a quote. So no, I'm not seeing -- and we are not seeing terms and conditions soften while things still stay in the excess market. And we're not seeing business flow back to the primaries. The real kicker there, Greg, is that look at these bigger deals run by banks, and this is why we say it very much feels like we're buying somebody similar to us. These are firms that were rolled up by the bank, typically good community people. I've heard 3 separate outreaches from Cadence people in the last 2 days that I've known in 1 instance that they came in to kick the tires with us in 1998. And I remember the guy wrote to me and he goes, \"Hey, I came with Shorty and I remember Shorty and I came with Jim, I remember Jim and I can't tell you how excited we are.\" Now what we're bringing to them that Cadence could never do is that whole discussion of moving upstream.  We can show you statistically that our closing rate on bigger deals, and I'm not talking risk management, huge accounts. I'm just saying the bigger deals that are generating over $125,000 to $150,000 of commission are significantly greater today than they were 5 or 10 years ago. This is what we're giving them the opportunity to go after. They're typical agents in these banks that look just like everybody else, and now they're going to go out. And frankly, they're going to have our tools and they're terrifically excited about it. So that's, I think, the whole synergy thing. This is not take out headcount. This is turn them on, show them what we do, give them the tools and watch them eat the market all around them. Well, here's the thing. First of all, Greg, we'll look at every single opportunity we can. And our first question every single time is what's the culture. What was it that went into this group. In most of these, there are situations where we didn't succeed in buying something they bought. Let's talk about that around this table, not with them in the room. XYZ didn't sell to us. Why is that? Okay, fine. What's left there? And yes, I would say that there are some of those that we would be interested in. But we'd have to get through this whole cultural piece. When you chose not to join Gallagher, I'll tell you the one main reason why you chose not to join Gallagher is because you didn't want change.  And our competition has done a very good job of saying, \"Hey, why join Gallagher when I'll give you the money? I'm going to give you the cash, keep some in. Our returns have been terrific. You'll get a second bite on the apple and you don't need to change anything. You don't need to change your name, you don't need to change your agency system,\" and while they've been doing that, we've been building power-to-power, data, analytics, capabilities and vertical strength. They've got none of that. And now it's coming to roost with higher interest rates and tougher earnouts, and you got to make do -- you got to come due on your promises. So yes, we'd look at them. But we're going to have to fall in love. There will be some follow-on promotions. Sure. There's good opportunities for everybody at Gallagher, yes. I'm going to ask you the Gallagher answer. There's not a lot secret at Gallagher, right? Yes, I would say that these moves have been telegraphed over about 20 years. It's interesting you should ask because we were talking about that with the board this week. And yes, we're seeing a lot of pressure on medical costs. Full insured renewals at our largest carriers are showing 7% to 9% increases right now as we speak. When you start to take retentions and you start to get in the stop-loss market, we're seeing averages there closer to 17% to 18%. That's on premium now. That's not on the underlying costs. But that's because more of the claims are tagging those carriers. So they're not only trying to move away in terms of the low end of the cost, but also they're having to pay that. So if you take a look at all of it, all in, Mark, I'd say that our numbers that we're seeing are about 8% to 9% and that's embedded both in work comp as well as health insurance across the United States. Well, let me split the question with Doug in this regard. Let me talk about market gains in terms of share gain and then he can tear the numbers a bit. But we're seeing and we're measuring this literally every single day, every month. We know now where we're producing business. We know, for instance, that 90% of the time, we compete with somebody smaller than we are. We know exactly what's happening in our verticals. We have 32 verticals that we're very, very clear on management expectation, knowing what's going on, building products and what have you. That's in the property casualty arena. We have another 7 or 8 in benefits. And in those verticals, we know that our growth rate is substantially greater than what is in our just general book of business. So internally, we know that we are taking definite share in those verticals. And I would probably -- I'd throw out a number, Mike, maybe you throw a number out on the table of what... Just in terms of the growth rate in the vertical as opposed to general. 19% of our new business falls... In one of those -- 19? 92, that's what I thought. I heard 19, I apologize. So each of those are growing faster than the general book. So value -- again, you've got to look at rate, you've got to look at exposure and all that other stuff. But when you talk about share, there is absolutely no doubt you go back to Doug's comment. An acquisition can be 1 plus 1 equals 5 because when Gallagher shows up with the relationships and the capabilities of the local broker and brings those relationships together with what we have as capabilities and the culture works, we don't have to force sharing on people. The fact that they can pick up the phone and say, \"I've got a college University. I've never worked on one before. Can somebody help me.\"  We will swarm that opportunity. We will write that college University they'll get their fair share, everybody wins, and we're not fighting that as a local entrepreneur who doesn't want to play with the big boys. That's the excitement. So I know that's a long-winded weird way of saying it, but we are definitely taking share. To the numbers, Doug, I'd throw over to you. I'll help you think through it and probably the people from Cadence Bank and say, he's maybe talking off the top of the head, blah, blah, blah. But I don't think the bank did much to help them produce insurance, like probably hurt their production, which is why when you look at some of these deals, the Board goes well, where is the growth. Cadence and Eastern good growth, but the fact is -- those people have gone out and scrape for that business around the bank relationship, which was, of course, when they bought those firms, supposed to be the golden nugget in terms of being able to produce business that just isn't true. In fact, I think we're going to unleash an opportunity to really grow the top line. Not really. If you take a look at our wholesale business, RPS. We do not mandate inside Gallagher, so it's not 100% Gallagher placements there. We did consolidate down to a smaller number of players and RPS does about 50% of Gallagher's placements. So we're very cognizant of what the world is like out there. But really, RPS trades with 15,000 to 18,000 independent agents. And RPS does not trade particularly at all with our 3 larger competitors. So if they were the ones that choose to come in back into the market, we think it would have virtually no impact on us at all. Day 1, and I do mean day 1 and the team will swarm that opportunity. Now do they get used to operating that way? Have they got the customer teed up. It takes -- it's still a learning curve in all fairness, they'll call and we'll jump on the plane and have a shot at that university. But it will probably be a year or 2 before we land it. So I can't sit here and go, day 1, it just ratchets up. But I'll tell you what it does. It gets everybody in that firm excited. It worked. Gallagher helped, you can't believe it. We turned this risk manager on their head. This is really cool. Next time around, what's the strategy? What's the methodology. So the resources are truly available to that team on day 1. Now would I factor into the earn-out. Some of them take great advantage of it and really does help. It makes their earnout. Others, as I said, it's a longer ramp-up speed and it's just a matter of the individual leaders. We've showed you in our IR Day, things like our drive, just Gallagher Drive. One, just one item that is so cool to these people. And it's basically the ability to sit with a client and say, people like you buy this. And here's what the lines of insurance are there going to these types of truckers in your area or construction companies or senior living. Here's the layers that they're buying. And by the way, you're holding a $10 million liability limit. Most of your competitors are paying 20 -- or buying $20 million of umbrella. Let me show you the losses we have in our book that appears to $10 million. You probably ought to buy the 20, there's reason for that. It blows the competition away and our merger partners can't wait to get their hands on it. That's 1 thing, and there's a dozen of those. No, there's no seasonality. Mike, go ahead. Well, thank you again, everyone, for joining us this evening. To our 50,000 colleagues across the globe, thank you for your hard work this quarter and every quarter. Our operational and financial success is a direct reflection of your efforts. And as pleased as I am with our third quarter performance, I'm even more excited about our future, future organic prospects, future M&A opportunities and our ability to become more productive and increase quality. We look forward to speaking with the investment community in person at our IR Day in December. Thank you again, everybody, and have a good evening."

            "name": "Douglas Howell",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll walk through third quarter organic and margins by segment, make some comments about how we see the fourth quarter shaping up and provide some early thoughts on full year '24. Then I'll provide some comments on our typical modeling helpers using the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website, and I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a few comments on cash, M&A and capital management.  Okay, let's flip to Page 3 of the earnings release. All-in brokerage organic of 9.3% which, as a reminder, does not include interest income like some of our peers report. Organic, including interest income would be about 12%.  A few soundbites: first, in total, we came in a little bit better than we foreshadowed at our September IR Day due to really strong results from reinsurance and London specialty; second, base commission and fee organic was strong at 9.6%; third, supplementals and contingents, together up 5%. At our IR day, we flagged some softness, mostly related to the Maui fires. Since then, we have also seen a very slight uptick in expected insurance carrier loss ratios that also had a modest unfavorable impact to organic. Regardless, 9.3% in total without interest income, 12% with, both are fantastic results for the quarter.  One special mention. Pat discussed that global renewal premium increases, we were seeing around 10% this quarter. And on the surface, it might appear this increase is a bit lower, maybe about a point from what we said in September and also from second quarter. It's important to note, when we look at our data by line and customer and then adjust for mix, the renewal premium increases for the third quarter are very similar to second quarter. So please don't interpret that there has been any meaningful shift in the market. We're just not seeing that.  Looking ahead to Q4 organic. Over the last year, we have reminded that we have an accounting headwind to overcome. Recall in Q4 '22, we booked a change in estimate related to our 606 deferred revenue accounting. That will now create a more difficult compare, called out about a point of organic headwind. Again, no new news here, but just a reminder as you update your models. Controlling for this, we see fourth quarter underlying organic growth approaching 9%, but the headline might look more like 8%. If we post that, that would mean full year brokerage organic in the upper 8s pushing towards 9%. Again, these percentages do not include interest income. What a great year that would be.  Flip now to Page 5 of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. We posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 32.4% for the quarter. That's up 55 basis points over third quarter '22's FX-adjusted margin. That's great work by the team to end up a bit better than our September IR Day expectations.  Looking at margins like a bridge from Q3 '22, organic gave us 80 points of expansion. Incremental interest income gave us 90 basis points. All-in M&A, mostly Buck which naturally runs at lower margins, impacted it by about 65 basis points. We also made incremental technology investments, called out about $7 million, and had some continued inflation on T&E, called out about $3 million, which in total used about 50 basis points. Follow that bridge and the math gets you close to that 55 basis points of FX adjusted margin expansion in the third quarter.  As for adjusted EBITDAC margin outlook for the fourth quarter, we expect about 40 to 50 basis points of expansion. And remember, that's off of fourth quarter '22 margins recomputed at current FX levels. However, unlike the past few quarters where FX created some noise, we're fortunate that now there's not much impact to consider, so much easier to model. If we deliver on that full year '23 which show margins expanding 30 to 40 basis points or 80 to 90 basis points levelizing for the roll-in impact of Buck, that would be a terrific year.  Looking ahead to next year, we are just beginning our budgeting process. And -- but our early -- very early thinking is that organic -- we're seeing organic in that 7% to 9% range. As for margins, we would anticipate seeing some margin expansion starting at 4% organic growth and perhaps if we hit 7%, call it around 50 basis points of expansion. And also, one other modeling heads up, please don't forget, first quarter '24 margins will have a slightly tougher year-over-year compare since Buck will still be rolling into our results.  Okay. Let's move on to the Risk Management segment and the organic and EBITDAC tables on Page 5 and 6, a really strong finish to the third quarter. 17.9% organic growth and margins at 20.4%. As Pat mentioned, we continue to benefit from higher claim counts related to the new business wins from the second half of '22.  Looking forward, we see organic in the fourth quarter around 13% and margins just above 20%. Organic does reflect the lapping of last year's newer large business wins and margins remain terrific. So if we deliver on that, full year organic would be above 15% and margins pushing 20%. That would be another record year for Gallagher Bassett. Looking ahead to full year '24, our early thinking is pointing towards 9% to 11% organic and margins around 20%.  Okay. Let's turn to Page 7 of the earnings release and the corporate segment shortcut table. In total, adjusted third quarter came in $0.03 better than the midpoint of the range we provided during our September IR day. Two reasons: first, lower borrowings on our line of credit and some of the M&A opportunities were pushed into October and November and second, lesser FX remeasurement headwinds.  Let's move now to the CFO commentary document to Page 3. A couple of things versus our September IR Day estimates. You'll see third quarter amortization expense is better by $7 million. But remember, this is noncash and doesn't impact adjusted EBITDAC nor adjusted EPS. This was simply due to balance sheet true-ups when we get our third-party M&A valuations. Then you'll also see depreciation is a touch higher by $2 million, but that is offset by change in acquisition earn-outs, which is lower by $2 million, so no net impact there. Looking ahead, we've updated our fourth quarter numbers and footnotes, so just do a double check of your models. And we will also update this page again during our December IR Day and give you a first look at 2024 numbers.  Flip over to Page 4 of the CFO commentary document to the corporate segment outlook for the fourth quarter. Only real movement is that Q4 interest and banking expense is up a bit, reflecting more anticipated borrowing.  Moving to Page 5. This is the page that shows our tax credit carryforwards. As of September 30, we have about $670 million available, a nice future cash flow sweetener that helps fund future M&A.  When you turn to Page 6, you'll see the rollover revenue table for third quarter -- the rollover revenues for the third quarter were $153 million, that's a little better than our IR Day expectation, mostly due notably to 1 merger that really hit it out of the park during the second half of September. It really shows you the potential upside mergers can see after joining Gallagher.  Looking forward, we have included estimated revenues for M&A closed and announced through yesterday. That's important to note these numbers already include expected revenues from Eastern and Cadence. We've assumed a mid-fourth quarter closing date, so please don't double count. And also, as we always say, please don't forget, you need to make a pick for future M&A also.  In terms of funding M&A, first, available cash on hand at September 30 was around $550 million. Second, our fourth quarter is historically a very strong cash flow quarter. Third, we currently have nothing outstanding on our line of credit, so we can use that or do a bond offering. And finally, if we close a lot of the tuck-in M&A pipeline that Pat discussed, before year-end, we may use a small amount of stock, but call it a couple of hundred million dollars.  As we consider these alternatives, we're always being very mindful of maintaining our solid investment-grade rating also. As for 2024, we are currently estimating about $3.5 billion of capacity to fund future M&A using only free cash and incremental borrowings.  Okay. Those are my comments, another fantastic quarter by the team. It's looking like another fantastic year. Congratulations to Patrick and Tom on their new roles. We have terrific momentum taking us into '24. Back to you, Pat. Rob, thanks for that. I think let us get through the budget process here, we'll have more for you at our December IR day. But right now, we're not seeing anything significantly different kind of across the portfolio of operations, but it's going to roll up somewhere into that 7% to 9% range as we're looking at it now. All right. So 3 things in there on that. Right now, the way I got to that number, doesn't assume much incremental lift from investment income. It does assume a little bit of a drag from one quarter of Buck rolling into our numbers that naturally runs lower margins. But by and large, maybe those 2 offset each other a little bit. And maybe there's a little extra roll-in impact from M&A from Buck. The rest of the M&A that we're planning on in our outlook for next year comes in pretty close to the same margins that we're at. Yes. Same thing I said to Rob. I said let's give you that -- let's give more flavor by division in December. That will be -- we'll be talking to you again in 6 weeks. I think we'll have -- okay, the way it works is that we'll have to -- it gets triggered off a full year '24 revenues because it's heavily skewed towards 1/1 renewals, I think we'll have a pretty good estimate of where we sit here before December. So I think I'll be able to give you a number on what we think we're going to end up booking for acquisition earn-out. Now we adjust that out, but I think I should have a good number by our December IR day, and then that would be paid out in the first quarter or second quarter of '25. I would say that it would be more so the Eastern transaction and it wasn't necessarily pushed. We had to file an HSR on that. So really, our early estimates of maybe getting it done in September might have been a little optimistic on that. But I wouldn't -- there's nothing else that you don't know about, let me put it that way. Yes. Typically, what we do is for a larger transaction like that, and we have a couple of -- 1 a year or something like that, we typically exclude that. The purpose of that disclosure is really showing you what we're seeing in the tuck-ins. The reality is, is we're still seeing great opportunities, a little north of 10x, maybe sometimes you get 1 at 12, some at 10. But there's a really -- there's a ton of tuck-in opportunities that are still realizing there's terrific value in that 10% to 12% range. And the reason why is they understand that they have careers inside of Gallagher afterwards. Their employees and their producers and themselves have great careers inside of Gallagher. So what a terrific thing? Sell your business at 10 to 12x, come in and work, take on increasing responsibilities, double your agency or your location.  So the reason why we can still be effective buyers at 10 to 12x is the future opportunity of getting better together. We set it for 20 years since I've been here. When 1 plus 1 is equal 3, 4 and 5, that's what they're seeing. So we continue to click those off day in and day out kind of in those multiple ranges. I think with Eastern and Cadence, I mean, it's not a -- there's no -- there's very few human synergies to be gained on this. As a matter of fact, they do a really great job servicing their customers and selling the insurance. But there are efficiencies that can be gained through a common general ledger, a common agency management system only needing 1 cyber protocol that runs over your platform. So there are some synergies there. But those are in the $3 million, $4 million, $5 million type numbers, not in the $25 million, $30 million or $40 million type number. Yes. All right. First, you're right. I think it might be about 34%, but I think [indiscernible] over a point or 2 on that. I think that when it comes to the tax, I think it's important on these margins, we always get a step-up in basis on smaller deals, but on many larger mergers that these sellers are not willing to allow a step up in basis. In this case, the sellers were willing to and we paid a little bit more cash upfront on it. But we're going to get $250 million worth of deductions over the next 15 years. Your present value that back at 5% or 6%, you get something . So it really doesn't impact them all that much because I don't know if they're -- they might be able to shield it with NOL carryforwards or something like that, but it benefits us a lot.  So to be able to achieve that. And it's not all that important in many times for, let's say, a PE firm that buys a bigger one over at trades because they've got the large interest shield coming off of the high levels of debt they run there. But for us to be able to negotiate that benefit and to be able to have a seller that's willing to allow that benefit to pass out, that makes a big difference. So in this case, this is a true win-win for them. They get more cash, we get more cash, and it brings our multiple down considerably on it.  This is not using our clean energy credit. We have $670 million of clean energy credits available. Think about that. We'll use those over the next few years. It's almost like we have another free Cadence coming our way because of those tax credits. So tax does matter. And in this case, we think that a conservative view of that benefit is $150-some million. We haven't. And can you give until December? I know you're trying to figure out your '24 models. You might want to take what we did this year and just take it by line by line and make a site pick on it to see what you think it -- what would happen there. I know it's really difficult to do, Mark, because of FX remeasurement gains. I know we put some acquisition costs through there that can be lumpy. And there's a lot of tax, restructure numbers that run through there as we implement tax planning strategy. I know it's really difficult. But if you could you just give me until December and I can get that to you. We get this every year. In terms of? 92% of our new business. Into one of our verticals. 92%. [indiscernible] that 7% organic growth next year, I'd say that half comes from net new business wins or taking share. I would say, 1/4 is coming from exposure units and another quarter is coming from rate. If you got 9%, you probably got 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in there. Yes. One thing, I think we actually understate true organic because we don't consider any new business, net new business wins by those mergers in the first year. That doesn't get counted as organic. Was it $20 million, $30 million more of net new maybe across the business every year? I don't know. It might be worth 20 basis points on our organic growth over the course of the year. So I think it naturally understates it. But I think the point is, like I said on this one just a minute ago. We had a merger partner that just crushed it here at the end of September, and that doesn't go into organic, but it sure impacts our acquisition revenues. Now we try to give you that when we do these projections.  So look at that on Page 6 of our CFO commentary. But the point is the great mergers are the ones that come in, hit the ground running, use our resources and capabilities. And next thing you know over the next 2, 3, 4 years, they're just hitting it out of the park. Yes. Remember, we're seasonally larger primarily because of our benefits and because of our reinsured business, our P&C business is fairly steady throughout the year over the 4 quarters. And maybe it's 23% on one quarter and 27% another, but we're not getting the wild swings like you do in reinsurance and employee benefits. I think when you look at it, if you look at the adjustment -- if you look at it on an adjusted basis, there were some tax and litigation items when we adjusted that out. On an adjusted basis, it's kind of noisy. Comp might be up $3 million or $4 million. I think we're a little further ahead on our corporate bonus accruals than we have been in the past. And when you look at operating expense, it looks down considerably on an adjusted basis, but that's the FX remeasurement gains that you're seeing. So if you're looking at it on a pretax basis on an unadjusted basis, that's what you'll see in there. But there's nothing fundamentally underlying our expense structure in the corporate segment."

It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had a fantastic second quarter. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments, we posted 20% revenue growth, 10.8% organic growth, and recall, we don't include interest income in our organic. If we did, our headline number would be 13.4% and over 14% if you levelized for last year's large life products sale. GAAP earnings per share of $1.48, adjusted earnings per share of $2.28, up 21% year-over-year, reported net earnings margin of 13.6%, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 30.4%, up 52 basis points. We also completed 15 mergers totaling $349 million of estimated annualized revenue. We had a terrific month to finish the quarter that fueled the upside versus our June IR Day view. I could not be more pleased with our second quarter performance and how our teams all around the globe continue to deliver incredible value for our clients. On a segment basis, let me give you some more detail on our second quarter performance starting with our brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 20%. Organic was 9.7% or 12.3% if we include interest income and about 13% when levelizing for the large life product sale. Acquisition rollover revenues were $151 million. Adjusted EBITDAC growth was 23% and we posted adjusted EBITDAC margin expansive expansion of about 50 basis points. Let me walk you around then Howell will provide some more detail commentary on our brokerage organic. Again, the following figures do not include interest income. Starting with our retail brokerage operations. Our US PC business posted 13% organic. New business production was up year over year while retention was similar to last year's second quarter. Our UK PC business posted 11% organic due to strong new business production. Canada was up 6% organically, reflecting solid new business, similar retention versus last year and continued that somewhat more modest renewal premium increases. Rounding out the retail PC business, our combined operations in Australia, New Zealand posted more than 10% organic. Core new business wins were excellent and renewal premium increases were ahead of second quarter 2022 levels. Our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of about 2%. That includes a three-point headwind from last year's life product sale. Excluding the tough compare, organic would have been about 5%, with core health and welfare up low single digits, and many of our consulting practice groups showed continued strength. Shifting to our reinsurance, wholesale, and specialty businesses, Gallagher Re posted 11% organic, another outstanding quarter by the team, building upon their excellent first quarter results. Replacement services, our U.S. wholesale operations posted organic of 10%. This includes 19% growth in open brokerage and about 6% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. And finally, UK specialty posted organic of 19%, benefiting from excellent new business production and fantastic retention and a firm rate environment. Next, let me provide some thoughts on the PC insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Global second quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure changes, were up 12%. That's ahead of the 8% to 10% renewal premium change we were reporting throughout 2022 in the first quarter of 2023. Renewal premium increases were made broad-based and are up across all of our major geographies. We're also seeing increases across most product lines. Property is up more than 20%. General liability is up about 8%. Workers comp is up about 3%. Umbrella and package are up about 11%. And most lines are trending similar or higher relative to previous quarters with two exceptions. First is public company D&O, where renewal premiums are lower versus last year, and second, cyber, which has flattened down slightly year-over-year. But to put this all in perspective, these two lines combined represent around 5% of our year-to-date brokerage revenues and thus don't have much of an impact. So I believe the market continues to be rational, still pushing for rate where it's needed to generate an acceptable underwriting profit. Remember though, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases to ensure their risk management programs fit their budgets. So not all of these renewal premium increases show up in our organic. Shifting to the reinsurance market. Overall, the June and July reinsurance renewals resulted in similar outcomes to what we saw during January renewals with most global reinsurance lines continuing to harden. Property continues to experience the most hardening, especially cat exposed trees.  Within the U.S., Florida property cat renewals were more orderly than January due to an early start and well-defined reinsurer appetites, regardless, price increases were in the 25% to 40% range, causing many seasons to increase their retentions. While property capacity isn't abundant, we ultimately were able to place risk for most all of our seasons. As for casualty reinsurance renewals, the second quarter showed more stable supply versus demand dynamics, resulting in price increases based on product or risk-specific factors. Looking forward, carriers are likely to continue their cautious underwriting posture given the frequency and severity of weather events, replacement cost increases and social inflation, all of which can impact current and prior accident year profitability. Add to that rising insurance costs, and it's easy to make the case for pricing increases on most lines to continue here in 2023 and perhaps throughout 2024. Despite these and other inflationary cost pressures, our customers' business activity remains strong. During the second quarter, our daily indications of client business showed positive endorsements and audits. These positive policy adjustments have continued thus far in July. At the same time, labor market imbalances remain. Recent data shows the U.S. unemployment rate declining, continued growth in non-farm payrolls and a very wide gap between the amount of job openings and the number of people unemployed and looking for work. And medical cost trends are on the rise. We anticipate these costs to accelerate into 2024 due to increased costs of services, more frequent high-dollar claims, and the impact of new therapies and specialty medications. So I see demand for our HR consulting and other benefits offerings remaining strong. So, when I bring this all together, as we sit here today, we are more confident with full-year brokerage organic in the 8% to 9% range. And with an excellent second quarter in the books, more towards the upper end of that range, posting that would be another fantastic year. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We had a very active second quarter. In addition to the Buck acquisition, which I will discuss in a moment, we completed 14 new tuck-in brokerage mergers. Combined, these 15 mergers represent about $349 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Moving to the Buck merger, which was completed in early April. Our integration efforts have begun and the combined business is off to a great start. While it's still early, I'm extremely pleased with how the teams are working together and excited about our combined prospects. Looking ahead, we have a very strong merger pipeline, including nearly 55 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing more than $700 million of annualized revenue. We know that not all of these will ultimately close, but we believe we will get our fair share. Moving on to our risk management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Second quarter organic growth was 18.1% ahead of our expectations due to rising claim counts and continued growth from recent new business wins. These wins have been broad-based and across all of various client segments, including large corporate enterprises, public entities, insurance carriers, and captives. Growth in each of our client verticals is great affirmation in our ability to tailor our client offerings, utilize industry-leading technology, and ultimately deliver superior outcomes for clients across the globe. Second quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.4% was very strong and at the upper end of our June expectation. Looking forward, we see full year 2023 organic around 13% and adjusted EBITDAC margins pushing 20%. That would be another outstanding year. And I'll conclude with some comments regarding our Bedrock culture. This past quarter, I was on the road for a month, visiting employees around the globe, traveling to New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and the Czech Republic. And I can say that our culture is thriving, which makes me incredibly proud. Some of those conversations included the more than 500 young people in our 58th class of the Gallagher Summer Internship. This rigorous two-month program is an essential investment in our future, ensuring our unique culture remains strong for years to come. As we continue welcoming new colleagues and merger partners into the Gallagher fold, I'm confident that each new addition will uphold the expertise, excellence, and ethical conduct that make Gallagher the name so trusted worldwide. And that is the Gallagher way. All right. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Pat. I'll walk through organic and margins by segment, including how we see the remainder of the year playing out. Then I'll provide some comments on our typical modeling helpers using the CFO commentary document that we post on our website. And I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a few comments on cash, M&A capacity, and capital management. Okay. Let's flip to page three of the earnings release. All-in brokerage organic of 9.7%. That would be 12.3% if we include interest income, and a little over 13% when further levelizing for last year's large live product sale. That's a bit better than what we forecasted at our IR Day in June due to a fantastic finish of the quarter across all of our divisions, especially U.S. retail and London specialty. You'll also see that contingents were up more than 20% organically. Probably a better way to look at it is in combination with supplementals, because contracts can flip from time-to-time. Together, up 12% is much more in line with our base commission and fee organic growth. So no matter which way you look at it, a fantastic organic growth quarter by the team. Looking forward, we see headline brokerage organic around 9% for third quarter and about 8% for fourth quarter. It's important to recall that fourth quarter will have a tough compare because in Q4 2022, we booked a change in estimate related to our 606 deferred revenue accounting. Controlling for that, fourth quarter 2023 organic would be towards 9%. We highlighted this matter last year and again at our June IR Day, so there's nothing new here, it's just a reminder as you update your models. With all that said, we remain bullish on our organic prospects for the second half. According, we now believe, full-year brokerage organic is looking like at the higher end of that 8% to 9% range. Again, these percentages do not include interest income. Flipping to page five of their earnings release to the brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. We posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 32.1% for the quarter. That's up about 50 basis points over second quarter 2022's FX adjusted margin. And that came in better than our June IR Day expectation of the expanding 10 basis points mostly due to the incremental organic growth. Looking at it like a bridge from Q to 2022, organic gave us 100 basis points of expansion. Incremental interest income gave us 90 basis points of margin expansion. The impact role of M&A, which is mostly Buck, uses about 80 basis points. And then we also made some incremental technology investments called out around $7 million and some continued inflation on T&E called out about $5 million, which in total used about 60 basis points. Follow that bridge and the math gets you close to that 50 basis points of FX adjusted expansion in the quarter. As for a margin outlook, we expect about 40 to 50 basis points of expansion for each of the next two quarters. For the -- so for the year, we are a bit more optimistic than our April and June views, and now see four year margin expansion of 30 to 40 basis points. Or that would be 70 to 90 basis points levelizing for the role and impact of Buck. Again, both those percentages or increases relative to prior year FX adjusted margins. We talked about that during our June IR Day when we provided a vignette on how to model margins. Let me give you 2022 margins, recomputed current FX levels for your starting points. In Q3, 2022, EBITDAC margins would have been around 31.7% versus 32.3% we reported. And as for fourth quarter 2022, not nearly as much impact, call it around 31.3%. So now if you move to the risk management segment and the organic table at the bottom of page five of the earnings release. Also, I had an excellent finish to the second quarter, 18.1% organic growth. As Pat mentioned, we continue to benefit from new business wins from the second half of 2022. Looking forward, we see organic in the third quarter on 14% and fourth quarter about 10% which reflects the lapping of last year's larger new business wins. As for margins, when you flip to page six and the adjusted margin EBITDAC table, risk management posted 19.4%. That was on the upper end of our 19% to 19.5% June expectation. Looking forward, we see margins above 19.5% in each of the last two quarters of 2023. So, full-year double digital organic and margins approaching 20%. That would lead to a record year for Gallagher Basset. Now, let's turn to page seven of the earnings release in the corporate segment short-cut table. In total, adjusted second quarter came and right at the midpoint of the range we provided during our June IR Day. Even though we did experience a further $5 million of FX related re-measurement head wins. That cost us a couple pennies in the quarter. Moving -- now, let's move to the CFO commentary document. On page three, you'll see most of the second quarter results were in line with our June commentary. And looking ahead, you'll see that we've updated our outlook to reflect current FX rates and provide our usual modeling helpers for the second half of the year. Moving to page four of the CFO commentary document and our corporate segment outlook for the second half, punch line here is not much change other than a modest weak corporate expense and interest in banking costs as we've assumed a slightly higher balance on our credit line giving our robust M&A activity. Then on page five of the CFO commentary, that shows our tax credit carry forwards. As of June 30, we have about $700 million, which will be used over the next few years and that sweetens our cash flow and helps us fund a future M&A. Shifting to rollover M&A revenues on page six of the CFO commentary document, $151 million in the quarter with Buck contributing nearly half of that. Remember, numbers in this table only include estimates for M&A closed through yesterday. So you need to make a pick for future M&A and you should also increase interest expense if you assume, we borrow for a portion of the purchase price. One other call out and that's back at the bottom of page three of the earnings release, we did use a higher than normal amount of stock for tax free exchange mergers this quarter. That can be a little lumpy, but we do like doing them. It's attractive to the sellers that are looking to defer the full tax consequence of selling the firm and it's also attractive to us because it fully aligns our new partners with our long-term shareholders. As for future M&A, we remain very well-positioned. At June 30, available cash on hand was more than $400 million. Our cash flows are strongest in the second half of the year and we have room for incremental borrowing all the while maintaining our strong investment grade ratings. We continue to see our full year 2023 M&A capacity upwards of $3 billion and another $3 billion or more in 2024 without using any equity. So another outstanding quarter by the team, from my position as CFO sitting halfway through the year, our full year 2023 outlook on all measures continues to improve, better organic, better margins, and a more robust M&A pipeline. Bottom line, we're in a great spot to deliver another record year financial performance. Okay, back to you Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, Doug. Operator, let's go ahead and open up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. The call for now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Now, our first question is coming from the line of Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nWeston Bloomer: Hi. Good evening. My first question, really good strong organic growth within brokerage and around 200 basis points of above what you'd said, I guess about a month ago. I was curious if you could spend on maybe what lines of businesses or geographies, or maybe whether supplementals or contingent that drove that out performance? Curious of what we can extrapolate for the back half of the year or what is about the nature?\nDouglas Howell: Yes, I think extrapolating for the back half of the year, we feel that our look towards nine and then eight adjusted to nine for the second two quarters probably the best way to look at what we think for the rest of the year. The upside was due to U.S. and also U.K. specialty, they just had a terrific in the June. So, but we're seeing that across the globe, there is a noticeable uptick here in June of success on our sales. And our retention are good and there is some positive light movement in those numbers too.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Also, I would say, clients are getting pretty darn weary of a hard market and they're looking for good advice. And we're fine and great strong growth is in property casualty. The basic blocking and tackling, workers' comp areas that in the United States at least we stand and opportunity to stand really ahead and shoulders above our competition, especially with the little guys.\nWeston Bloomer: Great, thanks. And second question on M&A. I believe you said 55 term sheets for $700 million in revenue. If I kind of go back do my model. I believe that's 700's the highest I've seen maybe away from Gallagher Re. So could you maybe just expand, is there any shift in your M&A strategy or any like larger deals in the pipeline? Or could you maybe just expand on what you're seeing in the market more broadly as well?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: No I think that what we're seeing is, first of all, remember, we talked about this quite often. We don't have one individual out prospecting. And we've got dozens and dozens of people that have now done deals in our company. They are constantly talking to our competitors. The more deals we do, the more friends they have in the industry that they're telling it's working well, and they're pleased to be with us. And I think it's just a matter of straight-up blocking and tackling when it comes to the typical making calls, talking to people, renewing relationships we've had for years. And people get into a point where they're possibly ready to sell.\nDouglas Howell: Yes, I think they see our capabilities. And I think some of the appeal of maybe selling to a PE firm, there's some concern about that giving that increase in interest rates in the borrowing cost. There's been some stress on that side of the industry. And so, we're seeing that folks are really more interested in being with a strategic now than trying to sell into a PE roll-up.\nWeston Bloomer: Got it. Thanks. Yes. It was double-digit. I think $1 million in revenue per term. So I got a little excited there.\nDouglas Howell: Me too.\nWeston Bloomer: And then last one, just on fiduciary, you'd highlight around 90 bps benefiting the quarters. Is that roughly what you have baked into the back half of the year when we think about your guidance?\nDouglas Howell: Yes, I think that this, I think the biggest job here in Q2, I think in the second half of the year you might see something like 70 basis points in the third quarter and it gives us maybe only 50 basis points of margin expansion in the fourth quarter just because rates have been popping up.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks Weston.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening. My first question, Pat, I know when asked on your typically willing to provide a little bit of an outlook on how you're seeing things more than just the current year. So based on how you think about things right now, how do you think from a thing of the brokerage business from an organic growth perspective, how do you think 2024 shaping up?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Elyse, I think it's going to look a lot like 2023. I'm not seeing any hesitation of underwriters asking for rate. I do think the cycles have shifted. When you see cyber and D&O coming down, they probably are coming down and that's reasonable. Property through the roof is reasonable. What we're seeing in inflation in terms of lawsuit, social implications we're searching for. It's very, very troubling. And then you had inflation. We've been talking about inflation, and it's called now for over a year. And you look back in the reserves and inflation tips those into a very difficult spot. And you're not going to get those healthy in one year. So I feel very strong about. And I'll tell you, our insurance companies are very, our partners are very smart about their numbers. They know where they're making money, where they're not making money, and they're telling us what they need. So I don't see people backing off on that. No one's walking in saying, the gates are wide open, let's just get volume. It's a reasonable market that you can get deals done at a reasonable price. Our clients actually understand inflation. They're living with it across the board, and inflation is good for a broker, honestly. So I think next year looks very, very strong.\nElyse Greenspan: And then Doug, I know, the bar was a little bit higher for the level of margin improvement this year, as 2024 looks like 2023 from an organic revenue growth perspective. Would we see more margin improvement next year at the same level of organic that we saw this year?\nDouglas Howell: Well, I guess my reaction to that is going back, I think that you'd see some margin expansion at 6%. I don't know if you'd get it necessarily at 4%. I don't -- I think by the time you got up to 9%, it'd be better than 50 basis points of margin expansion. And we do have one more quarter of roll and impact of Buck that would, the underlying business would be going up, but that business runs a lower margin. So, depending on which question you're asking me, I would think that margin expansion in 2024 could be very similar to what we thought it'd be in this year. Give us six points of organic and there might be 40, 50 basis points, give us nine points of organic, you might get 75, 80 out of it.\nElyse Greenspan: And then, when you're talking about price increases, are you making that comment on like a nominal basis or are you expecting that when you think about property casualty pricing over the balance of this year in 2024, that will continue to exceed loss trend?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Well, I think that's the battle isn't Elyse. I mean, the carriers are very much wanting and telling us they need that. So, yes, I think that would be the objective and we're finding that we can get it. So, I do think that they're going to look at loss trends and they're going to try to definitely keep the rate structure moving ahead of that.\nElyse Greenspan: And one last one. Do you have some initial thoughts on what we could see from reinsurance pricing at January 1, 2024?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: No. It's too early for me to comment on that, Elyse. I think, we just finished July, not as bigger month, obviously, as January, but interesting that the pricing was still very, very, very firm. The market after January 1 had a time, better chance to settle down, look at their books to understand, January was a nightmare. So as we said in our prepared remarks, July was a little bit more orderly, but still difficult. So, give me another quarter on that one.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please just use your questions.\nMike Zaremski: Hey, good afternoon. Investment income, is this the new run rate was better than expected or should we expected to take another like I guess, well, of course, the company's growing too?\nDouglas Howell: Listen, I think the impact on our numbers, I think that it's actually will be the change in margin from investment income was 90 basis points. This quarter, we think it would be about 70 basis points in the third and about 50 basis points of margin expansion in the fourth. So, to me, I would say that the actual dollar amounts that you're seeing in the second quarter are not just similar to the dollar amounts that you would see in third and fourth quarter.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And you guys are firing on all cylinders, I'm just trying to poke some holes here. Let's see if I can. So, I mean, just that will be realistic. U.K. inflation, the stats look like, it's high and there's wage pressures and some, at least slow in GDP outlook. How does your business look there -- has look there currently? Margin has been growing as much there, and any comments on that?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Our U.K. retail business is on fire, really on fire. And I give a lot of credit to the team on two ways. One, as you know, we've spent money there in terms of branding and we did not do that for years when we were putting together Giles, Oval, Heath. Those firms were trading under those names. We brought those together. We started talking about ourselves as Gallagher in the field. And our Rugby partnerships there and the efforts that we spent on branding had paid incredible dividends. And people know who we are now across the entire U.K. and our people are taking advantage of that. And I just visited in -- I was in our London offices for a good part of June. I was in Dublin in Belfast and I can just say this. There's a bounce in every retailer step. They're kicking ass, they're having fun and they're taking names and getting more business for next quarter.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. And just because Elyse asked for, I mean, I'm just going to sneak in a quick one. In terms of the pricing environment, taking a kind of a step up, how much do you think is due to the reinsurance cost trying to be passed through? And it sounds like you don't -- it sounds like it's not a big deal, because you're saying that next year could be similar to this year, so there wouldn't be a step down. But I'm curious if you think some of the momentum something on the reinsurance side?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Let's be clear. I'm saying that we're being told by our carrier CEOs that they have to cover their increasing cost base, that starts with inflation and their past reserves and, if you plan to rebuild a house for a million dollars two years ago, you're not going to spend a million dollars. So they are looking at those reserves. Then secondly, they're still in a process of making sure that we get our values right. These values haven't been touched for a decade. They haven't needed to be touched. So now you got a value increase. You've got exposure units growth. Then you add to that the cost of reinsurance, which is clearly a cost. They're not separating it out and telling our retail clients, well, this part is for reinsurance. They're say, look guys, on this line of cover, we need 25 points. Go get it. And that'll hold as long as we have to, in fact, do that to get the deal done. Now, remember, we are scouring the market for some little do-for-ten, because that's our job. But right now, there's no break in that.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Peters: Hey, good afternoon, Pat and Doug. Hey, I wanted just to have you for a moment talk about new business. Because when you look at the organic result, 10.8%. You look at renewal pricing 12%. When you went through a bunch of lines, Pat, where pricing was clearly double digit. And so, and you also made this comment about your clients having a budget. Just curious, how much of the growth organic is rate versus exposure, existing clients versus new business, and has that balance changed at all in the last year?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Let Doug talk about the actual numbers, because I'm more off the cuff. And then I'll come back in on how I see the market shaping. Go ahead Doug.\nDouglas Howell: So, Greg, our net new business versus loss business is up this year by two percentage points compared to where it was there. Rate is, then that's the total rate in exposure is up about a point and a half. So, you can see here that it's our net -- our increased new is actually up more than the impact from rate is up.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Now, let me add some color to that, Greg. Number one, we're doing a much better job, I think, than ever of measuring kind of this new business stuff that you're talking about. We know that our average production is actually increasing in the income. The commission income receiving on new business has moved up from, let's call it $50,000, $60,000 into closer to $175,000 to $100,000. That's per item as we start bringing it in. So we're actually finding those clients that have for a long time probably been pretty happy with either their local broker or their relationship with a larger broker giving us a chance and we're doing very, very well. We are a new business machine. And when I take a look at the percentage of trailing revenue that we try to accomplish every year in new business. Our goal has always been 15% of trailing. We're just about right there. And as our trailing revenue growth continues, that pushes us in terms of our goals for more new business. And we are right on track with that. And when you start having 15%, 16%, 13% of trailing in new business, as long as you continue those retention levels, 94, 95, et cetera, you're getting very, very nice. You're getting very nice upside.\nGreg Peters: Yes, that's good. Those are good numbers. I think I've opened up a can of worms, because we're going to want to start tracking the net new business wins you guys are posting on a quarterly basis.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: I'll give you that. Go and ask.\nGreg Peters: Yes. In your comments, Pat, you also talked about on the theme of poking holes, right? You talked about the employee benefits business kind of stood out. That MGA business being low single-digit, mid single-digit type of organic. Maybe I don't want to call that an underperforming, but relative to the group, I guess it kind of is. So maybe you could spend a minute and talk about those two businesses, because you called them out in your comments?\nDouglas Howell: Well, let's talk about the benefits business first. It's adjusted for the large life case 5%. I think that's pretty in line with maybe what some of the other brokers have talked about in their employee benefit space. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily out of whack compared to what's going on. That business right now doesn't have the lost cost increases that it's going to have. I think there's going to be medical inflation in that coming up. We're going to see on that a lot, but by and large, medical cost inflation does have an impact. When you go back to my early days here in 2003 through 2007, you were seeing medical loss inflation, cost inflation in the double digits, and that business was growing almost double digits also. So that will have an impact because you can't keep the inflation out of that space for too much longer. So that would happen. On the program business, you just understand in our case, there's some programs that if there's a change in the state or there's a change in the carrier appetite, sometimes that can cause a little bit of stress in that business. But still, being in those single digit organic ranges are still pretty damn good in this environment.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Yes. And let me add to that. Greg, right now, our clients are dealing with wage cost inflation as people say, look, I've got -- I'm having a hard time buying eggs. And they are not looking to be expanding benefit offerings. In fact, they're doing everything they can to mitigate increased costs and benefits, while at the same time being able to balance what they need to give their people in their regular income. While at the same time maintaining, as you know how difficult this is, their employee base. So it is a really tough time. And our consultants, our people are doing a great job. Outside of health and welfare, the effort in terms of our consulting business that the orders that are coming through are spectacular. So it's really a balance of all that. And I agree with Doug. I think that it's a matter of them trying to deal with inflation in the cost of the cover, inflation in their compensation costs for their people and doing everything. And that's where we make our living, its helping to mitigate that. Plan design change, getting that down. And then lastly, a lot of that, as you know, we do on a fee. So when you're facing compensation costs, inflation costs in the underlying purchase of health insurance, the last thing you're doing is giving GBS, a 10% rate increase. I think by -- I think getting five points is pretty damn good.\nGreg Peters: Fair enough. Just I know you provided some data. It's just the final question. I know you provided some data around Buck and the integration. That's a business that has had sort of a checkered past of success and maybe some challenges. Maybe spend a second. And this is my last question. Talking about the integration and why you think the outlook for that business is strong relative to its history?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: I'll tell you what, I am really excited about that business. And I'm a quarter in, right. And we had our board meeting yesterday and the team that's involved in the integrating and the onboarding reporting out to our board as we do in our large deals every quarter. The synergies there -- first of all, the management team could not be more excited to be finding a home. They've been traded five times. Then that's part of what you're talking about, Greg. You wake up and your name is not changing, but the owners are changing and then you're changing it again. You don't know who's on first, who's on second. A big part of our effort of onboarding here has been to tell those people, look, you found your last place. Now let's go take care of clients. And there's nothing consultants like to hear more than that. So that has been a big message to them. And I spent time with those folks in the UK. I've spent time with them here. It's resonating. Our retention of people is outstanding. And the orders we're getting in one quarter are mind boggling. So I'm really -- then you add to that. We do think there's some great synergies there. And that's not cost takeouts. That's cross selling. Seeing some of that already. And I think it's going to be just fine. And I'm one quarter in.\nGreg Peters: Well, thank you for your answers and the answers make sense.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our Next question is from the line of David Montemaden with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Montemaden: Hey, thanks. I just wanted to follow-up just on the group benefits organic and just on the deceleration, which is still a 5% is good extra life sale comp. But that was down for seven in the first quarter. But it does sound like the acceleration is expected. Is that something, is it second half expectation? Or is that something you think will start to move up higher in 2024?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: I wouldn't be modeling out, David, a huge acceleration there. I mean, I spent a lot of time with Doug on the street explaining why 3% organic was outstanding just a few years ago. Yes, there's all, I'm now looking it. I'm now looking at a business here that is accepting hard rates. Given the fact that there's big loss cost trends or reinsurance trends, these are people buying insurance and in many instances, not buying insurance, that's the biggest part of what we do is help people self fund. And that 5% growth is earned with a lot of discussion with a client. It's more akin to what Gallagher Bassett's getting in terms of their renewal increases rather than what you look at on the PC side. So I'm very happy at 5%. I don't want to give you this idea that you're going to see some acceleration to 12%. That's not happening.\nDouglas Howell: That business also can be heavily first quarter weighted. So you get a little bit of that, not only you have to recognize the full year of an account that you sell on the health and welfare side, but the consulting in the first quarter tends to be a little heavier or a little --you grow a little bit more than -- because if you think about it, most people are one-one type benefit customers. So they're putting the final touches on their business in January on some of the programs. So we tend to make a little bit more money in the first quarter.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Can I answer an underlying question I hear from you, David, and the others. Why do we do the buck deal? It looks like its growth isn't great, doesn't have the margins that a PC broker does. You realize where the pain is for our clients right now and what we are is pain mitigation people. And it's sure it's in property, casualty, its specialty property. And we're out there working every day to help them get that down. We're bringing self-insurance plans, captive plans, group plans, what we can on the PC side. And every year, year and out, our clients are dealing with how do we get people? How do we keep them? How do we pay them? And how do we motivate them and at the same time take care of their benefits needs. And to get a firm like Buck on our team, when it absolutely recognized as the best in the business. I mean, it puts us over the top and that ability to respond to our clients needs across all of what we do for them. And I think 5% is outstanding. I want to tell the team, congratulations.\nDavid Montemaden: No, thanks. I appreciate that. That's helpful, Pat. And I guess just maybe just switching gears just on the property casualty rating increases. You gave some numbers earlier. I missed some of them. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing specifically on casualty rates. And it sounds like we're seeing an acceleration there. If I just strip out D&O and workers comp. But I'm wondering if that is in fact what you guys are seeing and how sustainable you guys think those -- that acceleration is?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: What I've said in my prepared remarks, David, is the general liabilities of about eight. Workers comp, which has been flat to down for a number of years is up about three. And umbrella and package you're up about 11. So now, embedded in each of those lines have different reasons. General liability is social inflation, probably aging population. Workers comp is clearly, it floats with medical costs and it floats with employment. An umbrella and package is probably also looking at social inflation and property up 20% is clearly -- that's about exposure units and the need for rate.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. David, when I look at it, you want to break it on general liability umbrella of other casualty call that 8% to 9% is what we're seeing here on the sheet commercial auto is 8.5% or more. And that's a U.S. business that I'm telling you about. So I think in the second word, call it 8% to 9% on casualty.\nDavid Montemaden: Got it. And those did tick up versus 1Q, it sounds like?\nDouglas Howell: Yes.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: A little bit.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. Especially commercial auto its more around six and now its 10.5.\nDavid Montemaden: Got it. And then, could you just level set me, if I think about full year, the business that Gallagher rates in brokerage. How much of that is coming from property at this point?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Properties is our largest line. Doug, will give that number.\nDouglas Howell: What was the specific question?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: How much of our business is property?\nDouglas Howell: About 30% here for the full year 2022. That's about 30% of what we write.\nDavid Montemaden: Great, thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Hughes: Yes, thanks. Good afternoon.\nDouglas Howell: Hi, Mark.\nMark Hughes: Pat, you talked about medical inflation. You think it's going to accelerate. Given that the broader measures of medical costs are pretty calm these days. I wonder what gives you confidence that that's going to happen?\nDouglas Howell: I don't know if I'd say it's confidence, Mark. I mean, I'm not so sure it's good news for this society or for our clients. But social inflation, medical practice cost cover, and any kind of losses in that regard in the cost of employees. And you take your hospitals right now are working very hard to make sure that their people stay with them. Their turnover rates with the pandemic and the like have increased. Keeping their employees is a big deal. And the cost are doing that.\nMark Hughes: Specialty drug.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: No, on specialty builds helping me out here, specialty drug costs and procedures are up significantly.\nMark Hughes: Understood. Thank you very much.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Katie Saki with Autonomous Research.. Please proceed with your question.\nKatie Saki: Hi, Thanks. Good evening. I want to follow-up a little bit on the line of questioning on the Buck. And clearly an acquisition that definitely expands here. Ability to serve your clients from this portfolio. Kind of thinking about what you guys have seen in the first quarter of integration so far. Is there any opportunity to tighten up the drive or the impact that Buck has on brokerage margins over the back half of the year? Any opportunity you guys are seeing to increase cross sells or maybe find some expense synergies. Or should we kind of expect that to materialize more in 2024?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: I think it's more 2024, Doug?\nDouglas Howell: Yes. I would say 2024 and 2023, we're still getting our feet under it. But also I'd like to have a friendly amendment to the statement. So that roll in natural impact of a business, it just run naturally slightly lower margins. Call it in the 20s somewhere versus in the 30s, right? So the drag on us is what you see on the face of it. But they actually have a nice improvement opportunities as we join forces together to get better themselves. And that's really what we're looking at. If we can take this business that's in the upper teens and move it into the mid 20s. I think that's a good march for that business. And I think cut that at best. They've wrote to five different owners. They have spent so much of their time and in the last couple of recent roles of becoming a free standing independent organization. And there's extra conflict goes into that. By being a part of us and us being better together, I think we'll naturally see that natural improvement in their underlying margins. So they should be margin creative after you get to, as they improve their margins, they will improve our margins once we get through the first quarter of 2024.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: And then, Katie to your point about cross selling, maybe cleared. We do see cross selling opportunities, PC to benefits, benefits PC for sure. But what we see -- we're very excited about is cross selling inside Gallagher benefit services. Their strength in the United States is in areas that we're not as strong. We've always been in defined benefit pension consulting for instance, but they come with terrific strengths there. And they're not probably as strong, although they do quite well, but not probably as strong as we've been in health and welfare. So if you take a look at that, now you're not trying to talk to a new party, add a client. You're already dealing with the person who buys benefits. Let me bring in my partner who does health and welfare, and we're already seeing a lot of that. So I think there is good cross selling. I think that margin improvement will come, and I'm excited about it.\nKatie Saki: Thank you so much. And then, one more question on the outlook for risk management. Oh, sorry, just one more question on risk management. Doug, your comments seem to imply a little bit of a sequential slow down in organic on the back half of the year, adjusting for lapping last year exceptional out performance. I'm just kind of curious, is there anything you'd call out on that 14% and 10% organic gross guide that might be a slight headwind to gross as a year wraps up?\nDouglas Howell: The nature of this business, if you look at it over the last 20 years is that you can get some pretty large clients that roll into your business. And they don't come as steady as let's say, a smaller client might do. So if you sell the likes of large U.S. corporation acts and you sell them in the fourth quarter last year, you're going to get to benefit in fourth quarter, first second third and you got to lap yourself in the fourth. So it's more the timing of new business on larger accounts that's causing that. But if you stack it up, 18% this quarter and if you think 14% and 10%. When you get down to the end of the year, you're talking some nice one of the 13% organic growth in that business. And then we do have some nice larger clients on the drawing board right now that we're proposing on. I don't know if they'll hit in the fourth quarter or they'll hit in the second or third quarter, it takes a year or two to sell these larger accounts. So it's just a little bit more naturally lumpy on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So I would encourage you to look at it on an annual basis. And if you think about what they did last year and then you're looking at this year at 13%, there's actually a sequential step up on an annual basis.\nKatie Saki: Great. Thanks for your insights.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks Katie.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KVW. Please proceed with your questions.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: You out there, Meyer.\nMeyer Shields: Sorry, it\u2019s unmute. Can I connect there?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Oh, there you go. Yes, you're coming through now.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, yes, well, I probably do better on unmute. Same question from two perspective. Are your clients dealing with affordability issues in a maximum that in the context of what you said about pricing legitimately needing to go up. And I'm wondering how much of that is in client? How much more of that can client take? Is that going to shift sort of the revenue that you get from commissions as opposed to cash advantage or something like that?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Yes. And that's one of the things that gets us excited, because that's the genesis of our growth. That's what took us to a place where we could get public in 84. We are the people that help folks deal with untenable situations and turn them basically into risk management approaches. It's called larger tensions. We do that in a number of ways, whether it's by-line by state, whether it's by putting someone into a self-captive, whether it's just finding them a pool to be part of, that is a real defining aspect of Gallagher's capabilities. Do you know that?\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Yes, I know that its excellent at this point. I'm trying to digest the idea of how much more insured and pay. I'm just trying to get my head around that, which maybe at all with what underwriters actually need for rate.\nDouglas Howell: I think we have to look at it this way. What percentage of customers budget really is spend on insurance? And let's say some of the averages are 3%, 4%, 5% of what their total budget they're spending on insurance. So this isn't 30% of their cost structure So how much more can customers take in terms of this? Our job is to make that a small as possible. Let's never forget that. That's what we do day in and day out. But how much more can they take? Well, if their loss experience is bad, they're going to have to take some more.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Well, also, remember, this is not anti-underwriter. Underwriters are happy to have a self-clients move away from loss to them. If there's more self-assumption and they pick up an excess placement at the right rate, they're happy. It's not like they sell, my god, you ripped all this premium away from me. They understand the partnership. So we're counseling on, look, take more rate, make it easier for that carrier to participate in this at the right place on the coverage map. And we'll be able to get the limits you want if you got to take more skin in the game. That's all. And that I think is what  we do better than anybody.\nMeyer Shields: Okay, that's tremendously helpful. The same question on the re-insurance side. We've got property rates going up pretty dramatically. Is Gallagher telling its property clients that they should be buying more reinsurance in 2024 than they did in 2023?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: I'd say, what I'm impressed with our reinsurance people and it's way more sophisticated than I am frankly. But they are the best in the world of capital management with their clients. And this isn't a matter of us going in and talking to the local contractors that doesn't know what I'm going to do with a big time property increase or something like that. These are sophisticated buyers. They see it coming, they know how to balance their portfolio. And really, the advice Gallagher Re gives is not just buy it. And it's all about and again, I mean, this is one of the things that's exciting to me in terms of my learnings with Gallagher is that they are right at the crux of helping these clients manage their capital.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. And then one of the final question if I can. Just could you talk about medical cost inflation. Is the medical cost inflation that you're anticipating on the college consulting side. Is that manifesting itself at all in worker's competition claimed to Gallagher Bassett processing?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Sure, absolutely. I mean, a big part of workers' cap is medical only. That's escalating every month.\nMeyer Shields: Okay.\nDouglas Howell: Our job to helped mitigate that just like we do on the employee benefit side. Use of managed care is very, very important. You'll put a better growth in expert adjusting in at services in Gallagher Bassett that is medical cost inflation hits that too. Clients will look to a Gallagher Bassett to help them reduce their total cost of risk. And when medical inflation goes up, they will be clamoring for Gallagher Bassett services.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: And that's part of making sure we deliver the best outcomes.\nMeyer Shields: No, absolutely. I'm just wondering why the workers come take some joy right. I'm just going to end. If this has been tremendously helpful.\nOperator: Thanks Meyer.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Michael Ward of Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ward: Hey, guys. Thank you. I was just wondering on the M&A pipeline that you're talking about from the beginning. Is that -- would you say that's skewed to P&C, or could there be employee benefits in there too?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Oh, there'll be both. Yes, we keep a good strong pipeline on both. Now, we're not going to have another Buck on that list. I mean, Buck is one of the biggest players in that industry. Clearly moves us up in the ranking, substantially, but there are plenty of smaller practitioners. We'd love to have on board. Our tuck-in acquisition process has been benefits forever, along with P&C. So that's not a new thing. And there's lots of activity in that regard.\nDouglas Howell: Yes, I think fundamentally, any smaller brokerage business that finds that they need more capabilities, whether it's P&C or benefits, it's the same decision by the owners of those businesses that they just think that they can use, join us together when we better as we serve as those clients and the capabilities they can get from us, they'll get it from whether it's wholesale, whether it's retail, whether it's benefit, even in Gallagher Bassett, they have especially acquisitions there. If it's -- as the owners, it's the same reason they're selling themselves is because they need capabilities, and they think Gallagher is the right place to get those capabilities.\nMichael Ward: Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe in terms of internally, in terms of your own wage sort of inflation monitoring, just curious if that has calmed down a little bit as inflation overall has slowed down?\nDouglas Howell: Yes. Here's the thing. We didn't see the great resignation that you read about in the papers. We talked about that quite a bit. We were very fair with our employees on the amount of raise pools that we've given those raised pools are larger in 2022 and 2023 than they were in 2018 and 2019 on a per employee basis. So we've recognized that there are some costs that our employees have to bear, and so we think that the raises we've given them have been very fair and have acknowledged the inflation and the environment. We haven't really sat down to plan for next year yet to see where we'd be in those raised pools, but obviously we'd be fair with our folks. But as you see, some of the inflation numbers are cooling down and what it costs to live. But by and large, I think that we've been very fair. Throughout our history, we have given raises every single year that I've been at Gallagher, and we recognize the importance of our employees to do that. So, we haven't seen a big stress on that.\nMichael Ward: Awesome. Thank you guys.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Heleniak with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Heleniak: Yes. Just a quick question on the risk management side. Wondering if you could give a little detail on the claims count differences and changes, you've both claims count and severity and kind of what you're seeing versus either recent quarters or year-over-year, and I guess I'm more interested at. I know you touch on a little bit just on some of the casualty lines and workers comp and liability and kind of what you're seeing there in terms of the counts and the average claims size that you're handling at Gallagher Bassett?\nDouglas Howell: All right. So three things on that. First, when you look at it, we were seeing more COVID claims last year and that's basically gone to very little at this point that we still grew through that. Kind of existing customers, we consider that the claims are rising for existing customers to be flat-ish, maybe out a little bit. Now that was a trend that we were seeing also when you go back pre-pandemic, because as workplaces get safer and safer, so we're really the success that you're seeing in the organic is really our new business and excellent retention. So that kind of tells you, flat-ish from existing customers growing through the loss of COVID claims and conservatively better new business and better retention. What are we seeing for severity within that severity is going up. There's no question on average. As a percentage, I don't know if it's 5% or 7%, but overall something like that.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. That's a helpful detail. And then just another question on the M&A pipeline since it was so significant compared to recent quarters. Just wanting if you can also just talk about or comment on how much of that is, how much of the trend you're seeing is international versus domestic. I'm not looking for a specific breakdown, but anything you can share there on, or you continue to look at a lot more international deals than you had over the past few years?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Now international pipeline is pretty steady. The majority of what we're looking at as U.S. domestic.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. And then finally, any earlier read on to my renewal premium. I know it's probably a little bit early, but how that's comparing? Is it 12% or is it just too early on that?\nDouglas Howell: Our July numbers are better than our June numbers. I looked at the overnight for last year and there is a noticeable difference. Now July's not over. A lot of your activity happens in the last week here, but right now our early reads month-over-month as well as another step up.\nScott Heleniak: Okay. Interesting. Great. Thanks for all the answers.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. The final question is follow-up from Weston Bloomer with UBS.\nWeston Bloomer: Hey, thanks for taking my follow-up question. Are you guys closing with free cash flow was in the 2Q or any updates on the level maybe as a percent of revenue they're expecting for full year as you integrate Buck or given the strong 2Q?\nDouglas Howell: Well 2Q is our notoriously smallest corners because that's when we pay out all of our incentive compensation. We pay that in April. So the 2Q is as our smallest. The second half of the year is the largest. As a percentage you all toil in that those numbers more than we do that's just not really how we look at it. The fact is our cash flows closely tracked to our EBITDA growth. As you know that that because of our tax credit. Our tax load is a percentage of our EBITDAC is usually somewhere in the 8% range. Our CapEx is pretty consistent with prior year, so you don't have a significant change in that. So the only thing that really kind of impacts our cash flows different than EBITDAC would be a little bit taxes, a little bit the little growth in CapEx and then obviously, we're paying integration costs some of those we'll throw out in cash too on that. But right now we track close -- our cash flows tracked very close to what our EBITDAC is. So the growth in the EBITDAC is pretty much so what you're going to see growth in our cash flows.\nWeston Bloomer: Got it. Thanks. And then maybe ex integration cost is Buck, maybe cash flow neutral or maybe slightly cash flow negative just given the lower margin there?\nDouglas Howell: Oh, it's cash flow positive. I mean, we're not spending that much that on integration on this acquisition. So I would say over three years I think we're going to spend $125  million something like that. And it throws off cash flows and that's what's about.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks for being with us this evening everybody. I really appreciate you joining us. I think you can probably tell that myself and the team are extremely pleased with our second quarter performance. We're reflecting on fully year 2023 financial outlook relative to our early thinking, it has improved on every measure. As we sit here today we remain very bullish on the second half. And most importantly to our more than 48,000 colleagues around the globe, thank you for all you do day in and a day out, I believe our continued financial success is a direct reflection of our people and our culture. Thank you very much. We look forward to speaking with you again at our IR Day in September. Thanks for being with us.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had a fantastic second quarter. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments, we posted 20% revenue growth, 10.8% organic growth, and recall, we don't include interest income in our organic. If we did, our headline number would be 13.4% and over 14% if you levelized for last year's large life products sale. GAAP earnings per share of $1.48, adjusted earnings per share of $2.28, up 21% year-over-year, reported net earnings margin of 13.6%, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 30.4%, up 52 basis points. We also completed 15 mergers totaling $349 million of estimated annualized revenue. We had a terrific month to finish the quarter that fueled the upside versus our June IR Day view. I could not be more pleased with our second quarter performance and how our teams all around the globe continue to deliver incredible value for our clients. On a segment basis, let me give you some more detail on our second quarter performance starting with our brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 20%. Organic was 9.7% or 12.3% if we include interest income and about 13% when levelizing for the large life product sale. Acquisition rollover revenues were $151 million. Adjusted EBITDAC growth was 23% and we posted adjusted EBITDAC margin expansive expansion of about 50 basis points. Let me walk you around then Howell will provide some more detail commentary on our brokerage organic. Again, the following figures do not include interest income. Starting with our retail brokerage operations. Our US PC business posted 13% organic. New business production was up year over year while retention was similar to last year's second quarter. Our UK PC business posted 11% organic due to strong new business production. Canada was up 6% organically, reflecting solid new business, similar retention versus last year and continued that somewhat more modest renewal premium increases. Rounding out the retail PC business, our combined operations in Australia, New Zealand posted more than 10% organic. Core new business wins were excellent and renewal premium increases were ahead of second quarter 2022 levels. Our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of about 2%. That includes a three-point headwind from last year's life product sale. Excluding the tough compare, organic would have been about 5%, with core health and welfare up low single digits, and many of our consulting practice groups showed continued strength. Shifting to our reinsurance, wholesale, and specialty businesses, Gallagher Re posted 11% organic, another outstanding quarter by the team, building upon their excellent first quarter results. Replacement services, our U.S. wholesale operations posted organic of 10%. This includes 19% growth in open brokerage and about 6% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. And finally, UK specialty posted organic of 19%, benefiting from excellent new business production and fantastic retention and a firm rate environment. Next, let me provide some thoughts on the PC insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Global second quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure changes, were up 12%. That's ahead of the 8% to 10% renewal premium change we were reporting throughout 2022 in the first quarter of 2023. Renewal premium increases were made broad-based and are up across all of our major geographies. We're also seeing increases across most product lines. Property is up more than 20%. General liability is up about 8%. Workers comp is up about 3%. Umbrella and package are up about 11%. And most lines are trending similar or higher relative to previous quarters with two exceptions. First is public company D&O, where renewal premiums are lower versus last year, and second, cyber, which has flattened down slightly year-over-year. But to put this all in perspective, these two lines combined represent around 5% of our year-to-date brokerage revenues and thus don't have much of an impact. So I believe the market continues to be rational, still pushing for rate where it's needed to generate an acceptable underwriting profit. Remember though, our job as brokers is to help our clients find the best coverage while mitigating price increases to ensure their risk management programs fit their budgets. So not all of these renewal premium increases show up in our organic. Shifting to the reinsurance market. Overall, the June and July reinsurance renewals resulted in similar outcomes to what we saw during January renewals with most global reinsurance lines continuing to harden. Property continues to experience the most hardening, especially cat exposed trees.  Within the U.S., Florida property cat renewals were more orderly than January due to an early start and well-defined reinsurer appetites, regardless, price increases were in the 25% to 40% range, causing many seasons to increase their retentions. While property capacity isn't abundant, we ultimately were able to place risk for most all of our seasons. As for casualty reinsurance renewals, the second quarter showed more stable supply versus demand dynamics, resulting in price increases based on product or risk-specific factors. Looking forward, carriers are likely to continue their cautious underwriting posture given the frequency and severity of weather events, replacement cost increases and social inflation, all of which can impact current and prior accident year profitability. Add to that rising insurance costs, and it's easy to make the case for pricing increases on most lines to continue here in 2023 and perhaps throughout 2024. Despite these and other inflationary cost pressures, our customers' business activity remains strong. During the second quarter, our daily indications of client business showed positive endorsements and audits. These positive policy adjustments have continued thus far in July. At the same time, labor market imbalances remain. Recent data shows the U.S. unemployment rate declining, continued growth in non-farm payrolls and a very wide gap between the amount of job openings and the number of people unemployed and looking for work. And medical cost trends are on the rise. We anticipate these costs to accelerate into 2024 due to increased costs of services, more frequent high-dollar claims, and the impact of new therapies and specialty medications. So I see demand for our HR consulting and other benefits offerings remaining strong. So, when I bring this all together, as we sit here today, we are more confident with full-year brokerage organic in the 8% to 9% range. And with an excellent second quarter in the books, more towards the upper end of that range, posting that would be another fantastic year. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We had a very active second quarter. In addition to the Buck acquisition, which I will discuss in a moment, we completed 14 new tuck-in brokerage mergers. Combined, these 15 mergers represent about $349 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Moving to the Buck merger, which was completed in early April. Our integration efforts have begun and the combined business is off to a great start. While it's still early, I'm extremely pleased with how the teams are working together and excited about our combined prospects. Looking ahead, we have a very strong merger pipeline, including nearly 55 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing more than $700 million of annualized revenue. We know that not all of these will ultimately close, but we believe we will get our fair share. Moving on to our risk management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Second quarter organic growth was 18.1% ahead of our expectations due to rising claim counts and continued growth from recent new business wins. These wins have been broad-based and across all of various client segments, including large corporate enterprises, public entities, insurance carriers, and captives. Growth in each of our client verticals is great affirmation in our ability to tailor our client offerings, utilize industry-leading technology, and ultimately deliver superior outcomes for clients across the globe. Second quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin of 19.4% was very strong and at the upper end of our June expectation. Looking forward, we see full year 2023 organic around 13% and adjusted EBITDAC margins pushing 20%. That would be another outstanding year. And I'll conclude with some comments regarding our Bedrock culture. This past quarter, I was on the road for a month, visiting employees around the globe, traveling to New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and the Czech Republic. And I can say that our culture is thriving, which makes me incredibly proud. Some of those conversations included the more than 500 young people in our 58th class of the Gallagher Summer Internship. This rigorous two-month program is an essential investment in our future, ensuring our unique culture remains strong for years to come. As we continue welcoming new colleagues and merger partners into the Gallagher fold, I'm confident that each new addition will uphold the expertise, excellence, and ethical conduct that make Gallagher the name so trusted worldwide. And that is the Gallagher way. All right. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thanks, Doug. Operator, let's go ahead and open up for questions. Also, I would say, clients are getting pretty darn weary of a hard market and they're looking for good advice. And we're fine and great strong growth is in property casualty. The basic blocking and tackling, workers' comp areas that in the United States at least we stand and opportunity to stand really ahead and shoulders above our competition, especially with the little guys. No I think that what we're seeing is, first of all, remember, we talked about this quite often. We don't have one individual out prospecting. And we've got dozens and dozens of people that have now done deals in our company. They are constantly talking to our competitors. The more deals we do, the more friends they have in the industry that they're telling it's working well, and they're pleased to be with us. And I think it's just a matter of straight-up blocking and tackling when it comes to the typical making calls, talking to people, renewing relationships we've had for years. And people get into a point where they're possibly ready to sell. Thanks Weston. Elyse, I think it's going to look a lot like 2023. I'm not seeing any hesitation of underwriters asking for rate. I do think the cycles have shifted. When you see cyber and D&O coming down, they probably are coming down and that's reasonable. Property through the roof is reasonable. What we're seeing in inflation in terms of lawsuit, social implications we're searching for. It's very, very troubling. And then you had inflation. We've been talking about inflation, and it's called now for over a year. And you look back in the reserves and inflation tips those into a very difficult spot. And you're not going to get those healthy in one year. So I feel very strong about. And I'll tell you, our insurance companies are very, our partners are very smart about their numbers. They know where they're making money, where they're not making money, and they're telling us what they need. So I don't see people backing off on that. No one's walking in saying, the gates are wide open, let's just get volume. It's a reasonable market that you can get deals done at a reasonable price. Our clients actually understand inflation. They're living with it across the board, and inflation is good for a broker, honestly. So I think next year looks very, very strong. Well, I think that's the battle isn't Elyse. I mean, the carriers are very much wanting and telling us they need that. So, yes, I think that would be the objective and we're finding that we can get it. So, I do think that they're going to look at loss trends and they're going to try to definitely keep the rate structure moving ahead of that. No. It's too early for me to comment on that, Elyse. I think, we just finished July, not as bigger month, obviously, as January, but interesting that the pricing was still very, very, very firm. The market after January 1 had a time, better chance to settle down, look at their books to understand, January was a nightmare. So as we said in our prepared remarks, July was a little bit more orderly, but still difficult. So, give me another quarter on that one. Thanks, Elyse. Our U.K. retail business is on fire, really on fire. And I give a lot of credit to the team on two ways. One, as you know, we've spent money there in terms of branding and we did not do that for years when we were putting together Giles, Oval, Heath. Those firms were trading under those names. We brought those together. We started talking about ourselves as Gallagher in the field. And our Rugby partnerships there and the efforts that we spent on branding had paid incredible dividends. And people know who we are now across the entire U.K. and our people are taking advantage of that. And I just visited in -- I was in our London offices for a good part of June. I was in Dublin in Belfast and I can just say this. There's a bounce in every retailer step. They're kicking ass, they're having fun and they're taking names and getting more business for next quarter. Let's be clear. I'm saying that we're being told by our carrier CEOs that they have to cover their increasing cost base, that starts with inflation and their past reserves and, if you plan to rebuild a house for a million dollars two years ago, you're not going to spend a million dollars. So they are looking at those reserves. Then secondly, they're still in a process of making sure that we get our values right. These values haven't been touched for a decade. They haven't needed to be touched. So now you got a value increase. You've got exposure units growth. Then you add to that the cost of reinsurance, which is clearly a cost. They're not separating it out and telling our retail clients, well, this part is for reinsurance. They're say, look guys, on this line of cover, we need 25 points. Go get it. And that'll hold as long as we have to, in fact, do that to get the deal done. Now, remember, we are scouring the market for some little do-for-ten, because that's our job. But right now, there's no break in that. Thanks, Mike. Let Doug talk about the actual numbers, because I'm more off the cuff. And then I'll come back in on how I see the market shaping. Go ahead Doug. Now, let me add some color to that, Greg. Number one, we're doing a much better job, I think, than ever of measuring kind of this new business stuff that you're talking about. We know that our average production is actually increasing in the income. The commission income receiving on new business has moved up from, let's call it $50,000, $60,000 into closer to $175,000 to $100,000. That's per item as we start bringing it in. So we're actually finding those clients that have for a long time probably been pretty happy with either their local broker or their relationship with a larger broker giving us a chance and we're doing very, very well. We are a new business machine. And when I take a look at the percentage of trailing revenue that we try to accomplish every year in new business. Our goal has always been 15% of trailing. We're just about right there. And as our trailing revenue growth continues, that pushes us in terms of our goals for more new business. And we are right on track with that. And when you start having 15%, 16%, 13% of trailing in new business, as long as you continue those retention levels, 94, 95, et cetera, you're getting very, very nice. You're getting very nice upside. I'll give you that. Go and ask. Yes. And let me add to that. Greg, right now, our clients are dealing with wage cost inflation as people say, look, I've got -- I'm having a hard time buying eggs. And they are not looking to be expanding benefit offerings. In fact, they're doing everything they can to mitigate increased costs and benefits, while at the same time being able to balance what they need to give their people in their regular income. While at the same time maintaining, as you know how difficult this is, their employee base. So it is a really tough time. And our consultants, our people are doing a great job. Outside of health and welfare, the effort in terms of our consulting business that the orders that are coming through are spectacular. So it's really a balance of all that. And I agree with Doug. I think that it's a matter of them trying to deal with inflation in the cost of the cover, inflation in their compensation costs for their people and doing everything. And that's where we make our living, its helping to mitigate that. Plan design change, getting that down. And then lastly, a lot of that, as you know, we do on a fee. So when you're facing compensation costs, inflation costs in the underlying purchase of health insurance, the last thing you're doing is giving GBS, a 10% rate increase. I think by -- I think getting five points is pretty damn good. I'll tell you what, I am really excited about that business. And I'm a quarter in, right. And we had our board meeting yesterday and the team that's involved in the integrating and the onboarding reporting out to our board as we do in our large deals every quarter. The synergies there -- first of all, the management team could not be more excited to be finding a home. They've been traded five times. Then that's part of what you're talking about, Greg. You wake up and your name is not changing, but the owners are changing and then you're changing it again. You don't know who's on first, who's on second. A big part of our effort of onboarding here has been to tell those people, look, you found your last place. Now let's go take care of clients. And there's nothing consultants like to hear more than that. So that has been a big message to them. And I spent time with those folks in the UK. I've spent time with them here. It's resonating. Our retention of people is outstanding. And the orders we're getting in one quarter are mind boggling. So I'm really -- then you add to that. We do think there's some great synergies there. And that's not cost takeouts. That's cross selling. Seeing some of that already. And I think it's going to be just fine. And I'm one quarter in. Thanks, Greg. I wouldn't be modeling out, David, a huge acceleration there. I mean, I spent a lot of time with Doug on the street explaining why 3% organic was outstanding just a few years ago. Yes, there's all, I'm now looking it. I'm now looking at a business here that is accepting hard rates. Given the fact that there's big loss cost trends or reinsurance trends, these are people buying insurance and in many instances, not buying insurance, that's the biggest part of what we do is help people self fund. And that 5% growth is earned with a lot of discussion with a client. It's more akin to what Gallagher Bassett's getting in terms of their renewal increases rather than what you look at on the PC side. So I'm very happy at 5%. I don't want to give you this idea that you're going to see some acceleration to 12%. That's not happening. Can I answer an underlying question I hear from you, David, and the others. Why do we do the buck deal? It looks like its growth isn't great, doesn't have the margins that a PC broker does. You realize where the pain is for our clients right now and what we are is pain mitigation people. And it's sure it's in property, casualty, its specialty property. And we're out there working every day to help them get that down. We're bringing self-insurance plans, captive plans, group plans, what we can on the PC side. And every year, year and out, our clients are dealing with how do we get people? How do we keep them? How do we pay them? And how do we motivate them and at the same time take care of their benefits needs. And to get a firm like Buck on our team, when it absolutely recognized as the best in the business. I mean, it puts us over the top and that ability to respond to our clients needs across all of what we do for them. And I think 5% is outstanding. I want to tell the team, congratulations. What I've said in my prepared remarks, David, is the general liabilities of about eight. Workers comp, which has been flat to down for a number of years is up about three. And umbrella and package you're up about 11. So now, embedded in each of those lines have different reasons. General liability is social inflation, probably aging population. Workers comp is clearly, it floats with medical costs and it floats with employment. An umbrella and package is probably also looking at social inflation and property up 20% is clearly -- that's about exposure units and the need for rate. A little bit. Properties is our largest line. Doug, will give that number. How much of our business is property? Thanks, David. No, on specialty builds helping me out here, specialty drug costs and procedures are up significantly. Thanks, Mark. I think it's more 2024, Doug? And then, Katie to your point about cross selling, maybe cleared. We do see cross selling opportunities, PC to benefits, benefits PC for sure. But what we see -- we're very excited about is cross selling inside Gallagher benefit services. Their strength in the United States is in areas that we're not as strong. We've always been in defined benefit pension consulting for instance, but they come with terrific strengths there. And they're not probably as strong, although they do quite well, but not probably as strong as we've been in health and welfare. So if you take a look at that, now you're not trying to talk to a new party, add a client. You're already dealing with the person who buys benefits. Let me bring in my partner who does health and welfare, and we're already seeing a lot of that. So I think there is good cross selling. I think that margin improvement will come, and I'm excited about it. Thanks Katie. You out there, Meyer. Oh, there you go. Yes, you're coming through now. Yes. And that's one of the things that gets us excited, because that's the genesis of our growth. That's what took us to a place where we could get public in 84. We are the people that help folks deal with untenable situations and turn them basically into risk management approaches. It's called larger tensions. We do that in a number of ways, whether it's by-line by state, whether it's by putting someone into a self-captive, whether it's just finding them a pool to be part of, that is a real defining aspect of Gallagher's capabilities. Do you know that? Well, also, remember, this is not anti-underwriter. Underwriters are happy to have a self-clients move away from loss to them. If there's more self-assumption and they pick up an excess placement at the right rate, they're happy. It's not like they sell, my god, you ripped all this premium away from me. They understand the partnership. So we're counseling on, look, take more rate, make it easier for that carrier to participate in this at the right place on the coverage map. And we'll be able to get the limits you want if you got to take more skin in the game. That's all. And that I think is what  we do better than anybody. I'd say, what I'm impressed with our reinsurance people and it's way more sophisticated than I am frankly. But they are the best in the world of capital management with their clients. And this isn't a matter of us going in and talking to the local contractors that doesn't know what I'm going to do with a big time property increase or something like that. These are sophisticated buyers. They see it coming, they know how to balance their portfolio. And really, the advice Gallagher Re gives is not just buy it. And it's all about and again, I mean, this is one of the things that's exciting to me in terms of my learnings with Gallagher is that they are right at the crux of helping these clients manage their capital. Sure, absolutely. I mean, a big part of workers' cap is medical only. That's escalating every month. And that's part of making sure we deliver the best outcomes. Oh, there'll be both. Yes, we keep a good strong pipeline on both. Now, we're not going to have another Buck on that list. I mean, Buck is one of the biggest players in that industry. Clearly moves us up in the ranking, substantially, but there are plenty of smaller practitioners. We'd love to have on board. Our tuck-in acquisition process has been benefits forever, along with P&C. So that's not a new thing. And there's lots of activity in that regard. Thank you. Now international pipeline is pretty steady. The majority of what we're looking at as U.S. domestic. You bet. Thanks for being with us this evening everybody. I really appreciate you joining us. I think you can probably tell that myself and the team are extremely pleased with our second quarter performance. We're reflecting on fully year 2023 financial outlook relative to our early thinking, it has improved on every measure. As we sit here today we remain very bullish on the second half. And most importantly to our more than 48,000 colleagues around the globe, thank you for all you do day in and a day out, I believe our continued financial success is a direct reflection of our people and our culture. Thank you very much. We look forward to speaking with you again at our IR Day in September. Thanks for being with us."

            "name": "Douglas Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat. I'll walk through organic and margins by segment, including how we see the remainder of the year playing out. Then I'll provide some comments on our typical modeling helpers using the CFO commentary document that we post on our website. And I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a few comments on cash, M&A capacity, and capital management. Okay. Let's flip to page three of the earnings release. All-in brokerage organic of 9.7%. That would be 12.3% if we include interest income, and a little over 13% when further levelizing for last year's large live product sale. That's a bit better than what we forecasted at our IR Day in June due to a fantastic finish of the quarter across all of our divisions, especially U.S. retail and London specialty. You'll also see that contingents were up more than 20% organically. Probably a better way to look at it is in combination with supplementals, because contracts can flip from time-to-time. Together, up 12% is much more in line with our base commission and fee organic growth. So no matter which way you look at it, a fantastic organic growth quarter by the team. Looking forward, we see headline brokerage organic around 9% for third quarter and about 8% for fourth quarter. It's important to recall that fourth quarter will have a tough compare because in Q4 2022, we booked a change in estimate related to our 606 deferred revenue accounting. Controlling for that, fourth quarter 2023 organic would be towards 9%. We highlighted this matter last year and again at our June IR Day, so there's nothing new here, it's just a reminder as you update your models. With all that said, we remain bullish on our organic prospects for the second half. According, we now believe, full-year brokerage organic is looking like at the higher end of that 8% to 9% range. Again, these percentages do not include interest income. Flipping to page five of their earnings release to the brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. We posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 32.1% for the quarter. That's up about 50 basis points over second quarter 2022's FX adjusted margin. And that came in better than our June IR Day expectation of the expanding 10 basis points mostly due to the incremental organic growth. Looking at it like a bridge from Q to 2022, organic gave us 100 basis points of expansion. Incremental interest income gave us 90 basis points of margin expansion. The impact role of M&A, which is mostly Buck, uses about 80 basis points. And then we also made some incremental technology investments called out around $7 million and some continued inflation on T&E called out about $5 million, which in total used about 60 basis points. Follow that bridge and the math gets you close to that 50 basis points of FX adjusted expansion in the quarter. As for a margin outlook, we expect about 40 to 50 basis points of expansion for each of the next two quarters. For the -- so for the year, we are a bit more optimistic than our April and June views, and now see four year margin expansion of 30 to 40 basis points. Or that would be 70 to 90 basis points levelizing for the role and impact of Buck. Again, both those percentages or increases relative to prior year FX adjusted margins. We talked about that during our June IR Day when we provided a vignette on how to model margins. Let me give you 2022 margins, recomputed current FX levels for your starting points. In Q3, 2022, EBITDAC margins would have been around 31.7% versus 32.3% we reported. And as for fourth quarter 2022, not nearly as much impact, call it around 31.3%. So now if you move to the risk management segment and the organic table at the bottom of page five of the earnings release. Also, I had an excellent finish to the second quarter, 18.1% organic growth. As Pat mentioned, we continue to benefit from new business wins from the second half of 2022. Looking forward, we see organic in the third quarter on 14% and fourth quarter about 10% which reflects the lapping of last year's larger new business wins. As for margins, when you flip to page six and the adjusted margin EBITDAC table, risk management posted 19.4%. That was on the upper end of our 19% to 19.5% June expectation. Looking forward, we see margins above 19.5% in each of the last two quarters of 2023. So, full-year double digital organic and margins approaching 20%. That would lead to a record year for Gallagher Basset. Now, let's turn to page seven of the earnings release in the corporate segment short-cut table. In total, adjusted second quarter came and right at the midpoint of the range we provided during our June IR Day. Even though we did experience a further $5 million of FX related re-measurement head wins. That cost us a couple pennies in the quarter. Moving -- now, let's move to the CFO commentary document. On page three, you'll see most of the second quarter results were in line with our June commentary. And looking ahead, you'll see that we've updated our outlook to reflect current FX rates and provide our usual modeling helpers for the second half of the year. Moving to page four of the CFO commentary document and our corporate segment outlook for the second half, punch line here is not much change other than a modest weak corporate expense and interest in banking costs as we've assumed a slightly higher balance on our credit line giving our robust M&A activity. Then on page five of the CFO commentary, that shows our tax credit carry forwards. As of June 30, we have about $700 million, which will be used over the next few years and that sweetens our cash flow and helps us fund a future M&A. Shifting to rollover M&A revenues on page six of the CFO commentary document, $151 million in the quarter with Buck contributing nearly half of that. Remember, numbers in this table only include estimates for M&A closed through yesterday. So you need to make a pick for future M&A and you should also increase interest expense if you assume, we borrow for a portion of the purchase price. One other call out and that's back at the bottom of page three of the earnings release, we did use a higher than normal amount of stock for tax free exchange mergers this quarter. That can be a little lumpy, but we do like doing them. It's attractive to the sellers that are looking to defer the full tax consequence of selling the firm and it's also attractive to us because it fully aligns our new partners with our long-term shareholders. As for future M&A, we remain very well-positioned. At June 30, available cash on hand was more than $400 million. Our cash flows are strongest in the second half of the year and we have room for incremental borrowing all the while maintaining our strong investment grade ratings. We continue to see our full year 2023 M&A capacity upwards of $3 billion and another $3 billion or more in 2024 without using any equity. So another outstanding quarter by the team, from my position as CFO sitting halfway through the year, our full year 2023 outlook on all measures continues to improve, better organic, better margins, and a more robust M&A pipeline. Bottom line, we're in a great spot to deliver another record year financial performance. Okay, back to you Pat. Yes, I think extrapolating for the back half of the year, we feel that our look towards nine and then eight adjusted to nine for the second two quarters probably the best way to look at what we think for the rest of the year. The upside was due to U.S. and also U.K. specialty, they just had a terrific in the June. So, but we're seeing that across the globe, there is a noticeable uptick here in June of success on our sales. And our retention are good and there is some positive light movement in those numbers too. Yes, I think they see our capabilities. And I think some of the appeal of maybe selling to a PE firm, there's some concern about that giving that increase in interest rates in the borrowing cost. There's been some stress on that side of the industry. And so, we're seeing that folks are really more interested in being with a strategic now than trying to sell into a PE roll-up. Me too. Yes, I think that this, I think the biggest job here in Q2, I think in the second half of the year you might see something like 70 basis points in the third quarter and it gives us maybe only 50 basis points of margin expansion in the fourth quarter just because rates have been popping up. Well, I guess my reaction to that is going back, I think that you'd see some margin expansion at 6%. I don't know if you'd get it necessarily at 4%. I don't -- I think by the time you got up to 9%, it'd be better than 50 basis points of margin expansion. And we do have one more quarter of roll and impact of Buck that would, the underlying business would be going up, but that business runs a lower margin. So, depending on which question you're asking me, I would think that margin expansion in 2024 could be very similar to what we thought it'd be in this year. Give us six points of organic and there might be 40, 50 basis points, give us nine points of organic, you might get 75, 80 out of it. Listen, I think the impact on our numbers, I think that it's actually will be the change in margin from investment income was 90 basis points. This quarter, we think it would be about 70 basis points in the third and about 50 basis points of margin expansion in the fourth. So, to me, I would say that the actual dollar amounts that you're seeing in the second quarter are not just similar to the dollar amounts that you would see in third and fourth quarter. So, Greg, our net new business versus loss business is up this year by two percentage points compared to where it was there. Rate is, then that's the total rate in exposure is up about a point and a half. So, you can see here that it's our net -- our increased new is actually up more than the impact from rate is up. Well, let's talk about the benefits business first. It's adjusted for the large life case 5%. I think that's pretty in line with maybe what some of the other brokers have talked about in their employee benefit space. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily out of whack compared to what's going on. That business right now doesn't have the lost cost increases that it's going to have. I think there's going to be medical inflation in that coming up. We're going to see on that a lot, but by and large, medical cost inflation does have an impact. When you go back to my early days here in 2003 through 2007, you were seeing medical loss inflation, cost inflation in the double digits, and that business was growing almost double digits also. So that will have an impact because you can't keep the inflation out of that space for too much longer. So that would happen. On the program business, you just understand in our case, there's some programs that if there's a change in the state or there's a change in the carrier appetite, sometimes that can cause a little bit of stress in that business. But still, being in those single digit organic ranges are still pretty damn good in this environment. That business also can be heavily first quarter weighted. So you get a little bit of that, not only you have to recognize the full year of an account that you sell on the health and welfare side, but the consulting in the first quarter tends to be a little heavier or a little --you grow a little bit more than -- because if you think about it, most people are one-one type benefit customers. So they're putting the final touches on their business in January on some of the programs. So we tend to make a little bit more money in the first quarter. Yes. David, when I look at it, you want to break it on general liability umbrella of other casualty call that 8% to 9% is what we're seeing here on the sheet commercial auto is 8.5% or more. And that's a U.S. business that I'm telling you about. So I think in the second word, call it 8% to 9% on casualty. Yes. Yes. Especially commercial auto its more around six and now its 10.5. What was the specific question? About 30% here for the full year 2022. That's about 30% of what we write. Hi, Mark. I don't know if I'd say it's confidence, Mark. I mean, I'm not so sure it's good news for this society or for our clients. But social inflation, medical practice cost cover, and any kind of losses in that regard in the cost of employees. And you take your hospitals right now are working very hard to make sure that their people stay with them. Their turnover rates with the pandemic and the like have increased. Keeping their employees is a big deal. And the cost are doing that. Yes. I would say 2024 and 2023, we're still getting our feet under it. But also I'd like to have a friendly amendment to the statement. So that roll in natural impact of a business, it just run naturally slightly lower margins. Call it in the 20s somewhere versus in the 30s, right? So the drag on us is what you see on the face of it. But they actually have a nice improvement opportunities as we join forces together to get better themselves. And that's really what we're looking at. If we can take this business that's in the upper teens and move it into the mid 20s. I think that's a good march for that business. And I think cut that at best. They've wrote to five different owners. They have spent so much of their time and in the last couple of recent roles of becoming a free standing independent organization. And there's extra conflict goes into that. By being a part of us and us being better together, I think we'll naturally see that natural improvement in their underlying margins. So they should be margin creative after you get to, as they improve their margins, they will improve our margins once we get through the first quarter of 2024. The nature of this business, if you look at it over the last 20 years is that you can get some pretty large clients that roll into your business. And they don't come as steady as let's say, a smaller client might do. So if you sell the likes of large U.S. corporation acts and you sell them in the fourth quarter last year, you're going to get to benefit in fourth quarter, first second third and you got to lap yourself in the fourth. So it's more the timing of new business on larger accounts that's causing that. But if you stack it up, 18% this quarter and if you think 14% and 10%. When you get down to the end of the year, you're talking some nice one of the 13% organic growth in that business. And then we do have some nice larger clients on the drawing board right now that we're proposing on. I don't know if they'll hit in the fourth quarter or they'll hit in the second or third quarter, it takes a year or two to sell these larger accounts. So it's just a little bit more naturally lumpy on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So I would encourage you to look at it on an annual basis. And if you think about what they did last year and then you're looking at this year at 13%, there's actually a sequential step up on an annual basis. I think we have to look at it this way. What percentage of customers budget really is spend on insurance? And let's say some of the averages are 3%, 4%, 5% of what their total budget they're spending on insurance. So this isn't 30% of their cost structure So how much more can customers take in terms of this? Our job is to make that a small as possible. Let's never forget that. That's what we do day in and day out. But how much more can they take? Well, if their loss experience is bad, they're going to have to take some more. Our job to helped mitigate that just like we do on the employee benefit side. Use of managed care is very, very important. You'll put a better growth in expert adjusting in at services in Gallagher Bassett that is medical cost inflation hits that too. Clients will look to a Gallagher Bassett to help them reduce their total cost of risk. And when medical inflation goes up, they will be clamoring for Gallagher Bassett services. Yes, I think fundamentally, any smaller brokerage business that finds that they need more capabilities, whether it's P&C or benefits, it's the same decision by the owners of those businesses that they just think that they can use, join us together when we better as we serve as those clients and the capabilities they can get from us, they'll get it from whether it's wholesale, whether it's retail, whether it's benefit, even in Gallagher Bassett, they have especially acquisitions there. If it's -- as the owners, it's the same reason they're selling themselves is because they need capabilities, and they think Gallagher is the right place to get those capabilities. Yes. Here's the thing. We didn't see the great resignation that you read about in the papers. We talked about that quite a bit. We were very fair with our employees on the amount of raise pools that we've given those raised pools are larger in 2022 and 2023 than they were in 2018 and 2019 on a per employee basis. So we've recognized that there are some costs that our employees have to bear, and so we think that the raises we've given them have been very fair and have acknowledged the inflation and the environment. We haven't really sat down to plan for next year yet to see where we'd be in those raised pools, but obviously we'd be fair with our folks. But as you see, some of the inflation numbers are cooling down and what it costs to live. But by and large, I think that we've been very fair. Throughout our history, we have given raises every single year that I've been at Gallagher, and we recognize the importance of our employees to do that. So, we haven't seen a big stress on that. All right. So three things on that. First, when you look at it, we were seeing more COVID claims last year and that's basically gone to very little at this point that we still grew through that. Kind of existing customers, we consider that the claims are rising for existing customers to be flat-ish, maybe out a little bit. Now that was a trend that we were seeing also when you go back pre-pandemic, because as workplaces get safer and safer, so we're really the success that you're seeing in the organic is really our new business and excellent retention. So that kind of tells you, flat-ish from existing customers growing through the loss of COVID claims and conservatively better new business and better retention. What are we seeing for severity within that severity is going up. There's no question on average. As a percentage, I don't know if it's 5% or 7%, but overall something like that. Our July numbers are better than our June numbers. I looked at the overnight for last year and there is a noticeable difference. Now July's not over. A lot of your activity happens in the last week here, but right now our early reads month-over-month as well as another step up. Well 2Q is our notoriously smallest corners because that's when we pay out all of our incentive compensation. We pay that in April. So the 2Q is as our smallest. The second half of the year is the largest. As a percentage you all toil in that those numbers more than we do that's just not really how we look at it. The fact is our cash flows closely tracked to our EBITDA growth. As you know that that because of our tax credit. Our tax load is a percentage of our EBITDAC is usually somewhere in the 8% range. Our CapEx is pretty consistent with prior year, so you don't have a significant change in that. So the only thing that really kind of impacts our cash flows different than EBITDAC would be a little bit taxes, a little bit the little growth in CapEx and then obviously, we're paying integration costs some of those we'll throw out in cash too on that. But right now we track close -- our cash flows tracked very close to what our EBITDAC is. So the growth in the EBITDAC is pretty much so what you're going to see growth in our cash flows. Oh, it's cash flow positive. I mean, we're not spending that much that on integration on this acquisition. So I would say over three years I think we're going to spend $125  million something like that. And it throws off cash flows and that's what's about."

It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Chairman, President and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Company. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. On the call for today is Doug Howell, our CFO as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had an excellent first quarter to start the year. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments, we posted 12% growth in revenue, 9.7% organic growth. GAAP earnings per share of $2.52, adjusted earnings per share of $3.30 up 12% year-over-year. Reported net earnings margin of 21%, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 38% up 29 basis points. We also completed 10 mergers totaling $69 million of estimated annualized revenue and we are recognized as the world's most ethical company for the thirteenth time, an outstanding quarter from the team. Let me give you some more detail on our first quarter performance starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 12%. Organic was 9.1%. Acquisition rollover revenues were $61 million. Adjusted EBITDAC growth was 15% and we posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 40.4% right on our March IR Day expectations. A fantastic quarter for the brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and provide some more detailed commentary on our brokerage organic. Starting with our retail brokerage operations. Our U.S. PC business posted over 7% organic. Core new business was up year-over-year, even growing over the tough renewal compare in D&O lines, while retention was similar to last year's first quarter. Our UK PC business also posted more than 7% organic due to strong new business production, stable retention and the continued impact of renewal premium increases. Our combined PC operations in Australia and New Zealand posted organic of 10%. Net new versus loss business was consistent with prior year and renewal premium increases were ahead of first quarter 2022 levels. Rounding out the retail PC business, Canada was up 6% organically reflecting solid new business and consistent year-over-year retention. Our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of nearly 7%. New business remains strong and client retention was excellent. We saw growth across many of our practice groups with particular strength in HR consulting and pharmacy benefits. Shifting to our wholesale and specialty businesses. Risk placement services, our U.S. Wholesale operations posted organic of nearly 8%. This includes 16% growth in open brokerage and about 5% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business production and retention were both consistent with last year's first quarter. UK specialty posted organic of 17% benefiting from a strong start within aviation and the addition of new teams focused on North American risks. And finally, reinsurance, Gallagher posted 12% organic reflecting new business wins, great retention and a hardening property reinsurance market. Outstanding results from the Gallagher Re team. Pulling it all together Brokerage segment all in organic of 9.1% that's a bit above the top end of our first quarter expectation and a fantastic sales quarter by the team. Next, let me provide some thoughts on the PC insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Overall, global first quarter renewal premiums that's both rate and exposure combined were up more than 9% consistent with the 8% to 10% renewal premium change we had been reporting throughout 2022. Renewal premium increases remain broad based across nearly all of our major geographies and product lines around the globe. For example, workers' comp is up low single digits, general liabilities up mid to high single digits. Umbrella and package are up in the low double digits, so most lines are trending similar to previous quarters. Two exceptions. First, public D&O where renewal premiums are down a bit and second property, where renewal premium increases are accelerating. For example, fourth quarter property renewal premiums were up 15% and through the first three months of 2023, we have seen increases of 15%, 20%, and 17%, respectively. So, our clients continue to feel cost pressures here due to rising replacement values, increasing frequency and severity of weather related events and hard reinsurance conditions. We're not seeing signs that these lost costs and profitability pressures are likely to abate in the near term. So as we head to our largest primary insurance property quarter we are focused on helping our clients navigate and mitigate these premium increases. Moving to exposures. We are seeing continued strength in our customer's business activity. First quarter mid-term policy endorsements audits and cancellations combined were better than first quarter 2022 levels greater than the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. Shifting to reinsurance. During the heavy Japan centric April renewals, reinsurance carriers continued to focus on increased pricing and tightening terms and conditions. This was across a broader range of territories and most all lines of business, so in even harder conditions compared to January 1. The casualty trading market saw orderly renewals and a sufficient supply of capital to fulfill the demand from underwriting enterprises. The property market continued to experience its recent challenges due to more limited underwriting capital. There were some green shoots in the ILS issuance, although pricing was typically less attractive to CDs than the traditional markets. Overall, there wasn't much new capacity entering the property market regardless, our teams navigated the hard market and customers again managed to secure satisfactory cover. Those interested in more detailed commentary can find our April first view market report at our website. Looking forward, there is good reason to expect a cautious underwriting stance from carriers for the foreseeable future as they contemplate recent weather events, replacement cost increases, social inflation and ongoing geopolitical tensions into their view of lost cost trend. So we expect insurance and reinsurance pricing increases to continue throughout 2023 and while it's early likely into 2024. We also remain optimistic on our customer's business activity during 2023. We have yet to see any significant shifts to daily indications of client, business activity thus far in April. We are also seeing encouraging employment levels for our benefits clients suggesting the economic backdrop for 2023 remains broadly favorable. Recent data shows the U. S. Unemployment rate declining. Continued growth in non-farm payrolls and a very wide gap between the amount of job openings and the number of people unemployed and looking for work. So I see demand for our products and services around attracting, retaining, and motivating workforces remaining strong. As we sit here today, we continue to see full-year 2023 brokerage segment organic in that 7% to 9% range and that would be another fantastic year. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We had an active first quarter completing 10 new tuck in brokerage mergers representing about $69 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Also in April, we officially welcomed the former Buck colleagues, combined with our existing employee benefits brokerage and HR consulting business we will enhance our offerings and be better positioned to deliver superior human capital solutions for all of our clients. Moving to our pipeline, we have nearly 40 term sheets signed or being prepared representing more than $350 million of annualized revenue. Good firms always have a choice of who to partner with, and we'll be very excited if they choose to join Gallagher. Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher asset. First quarter organic growth was 14.3% ahead of our expectations due to continued growth from recent new business wins and some revenue from first quarter New Zealand cyclone and flooding. We also saw core new arising claims increase in the low single digits during the quarter for existing clients across both workers' comp and liability. First quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was also strong at 19.2% ended up a bit ahead of our March expectations. Looking forward, we see full-year 2023 organic around 12% to 13% and adjusted EBITDAC margins holding up or above 19% and that would be another excellent year. And I'll conclude with some comments regarding our Bedrock culture. I'm very pleased that just a few weeks ago, we were recognized as the World's Most Ethical Companies for the thirteenth time. We're honored to be one of only 135 companies globally to receive this award from the Ethisphere Institute. Our 45,000 plus colleagues embrace and celebrate the unique values that we have instilled in our company. The 25 tenants articulated in the Gallagher way continue to drive our global team's success today and we believe that our unique culture is a key differentiator and a competitive advantage. It's a strong culture of client focus, excellence, and inclusion and it continues to drive us forward. That is the Gallagher way. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDouglas K. Howell: Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon everyone. As Pat said, an excellent start to the year. Today, I'll begin with some comments using both our earnings release and our CFO commentary document that we post on our website. I'll touch on organic margins and provide some modeling helpers for the remainder of 2023. Then I'll finish up with my typical comments in cash, M&A capacity and capital management. Okay. Let's flip to page 2 of the earnings release. All in brokerage organic of 9.1%. Call it right at the top end of the range we foreshadowed at our March 16th IR Day, a nice finish from our London specialty operations and a little upside from reinsurance benefits. One call out on that table. Contingence didn't grow organically this quarter for three reasons. First, there's a little geography between supplementals and contention call that about $2 million. Second, there was a bit of positive development in Q1 2022 from the prior year 2021 estimates. Call that $3 million and again, that's back in first quarter 2022, causing a little difficult compare. And third, we are not expecting one of our programs to pay as large of a contingent here in 2023 because of underlying loss ratio deterioration. Call that maybe towards a million. Regardless, base organic at 9.5% and all in at 9.1% that's a fantastic quarter by the team. Hoping to page 4 of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. We posted 40.4% for the quarter, before FX, that's up 56 basis points. And FX adjusted up 14 basis points over first quarter 2022. That's right in line with our March IR Day expectations when we discuss that first quarter 2022 expenses were lower than our expected run rate simply because we are still in the Omicron portion of the pandemic and that our tuck in acquisitions are just not as seasonally weighted. But they don't roll in at 40 points of margin here in the first quarter. If you levelize for those two items, our margins expanded approximately 110 basis points. Maybe looking at it like a bridge from first quarter 2022 will be helpful. Investment income gave us 90 basis points of margin expansion. The normalization of Omicron T&E expenses and inflation on all T&E costs us 80 basis points. The seasonal impact from rolling M&A uses about 40 basis points. Organic gave us 70 basis points of expansion and some additional wages and IT investments used about 25 basis points. Follow that bridge and the mass gets you close to that 14 basis points of FX adjusted expansion in the quarter. Looking forward, it's still early yet with a fantastic first quarter combined with pass up commentary makes us more bullish on hitting that full-year brokerage organic in the 7% to 9% range and posting adjusted margins up 60 basis points to 80 basis points. Two small heads up on that. First, getting to that 7% to 9% organic for the full-year might be a little lumpy over the next three quarters given the large life case we sold in Q2 2022. And then the 606 deferred revenue accounting in our fourth quarter. We discussed both of those with you last year, so there's no new news here. Just a reminder for your modeling. Second, the 60 to 80 basis points of margin expansion is before the roll in impact of Buck, which recall naturally runs lower margins. So when you include Buck, the math would show full year margin expansion in that 20 to 30 basis points range. So moving on to the Risk Management segment and the organic table at the bottom of page 4. As Pat said, an excellent quarter, 14.3% organic growth We did get a little tailwind this quarter because Omicron caused fewer claims arising in Q1 2022 and we also had some New Zealand [CAC] (ph) claims activity. But most of this excellent result comes from strong new business wins in the second half last year. As for margins, put to page 5 of the earnings release. Risk Management posted adjusted Q1 EBITDAC margins of 19.2%. That's up 177 basis points over last year. As we look forward, we're seeing the rest of the year organic in that 12% to 13% range and full-year margins now finishing a bit above 19%. That would be the best full-year adjusted margin in Gallagher asset six decade history. Another demonstration of the benefits of scale, intellectual capital, technology and operational excellence. Let's turn to page 6 of the earnings release. That's our Corporate segment and also, when you take a look at pages 3 and 4 of the CFO commentary document, most all of the items are right in line with our March IR Day forecast. Three callouts on the CFO commentary document. When you see Page 3, you'll see a slight tick up in our expected book effective tax rate. That's entirely due to the UK rate hike to 25% that went effective April 1st. But remember what you're seeing is a book effective tax rate. Our cash taxes paid rate is substantially lower. Call that around 10% of our adjusted combined brokerage and risk management EBITDAC. That's because of the tax shield from interest, the amortization of purchase intangibles and the incremental cash flows from our clean energy investments over the coming years. Page 5 of the CFO commentary shows those tax credits. We have over $700 million as of March 31st, and it shows that we're forecasting to use about a $180 million to $200 million in 2023 with a step up in 2024 in each later year. That's a really nice cash flow sweetener to help fund future M&A. Then if you flip back to page 4 of the CFO commentary document, you'll see that we had a slight beat on the Corporate segment this quarter compared to our midpoint, but some timing in that beat. So you'll see full-year still about the same as what we forecasted our March IR Day. Moving now to page 6 of the CFO commentary document, that table shows our rollover M&A revenues. It shows $61 million this quarter, which is pretty close to that $63 million we estimated during our March IR Day. And also looking forward, we've now included Buck in that table, but remember, you'll need to add your pick for other future M&A to these estimates. Let me move to some comments on cash, capital management and future M&A. At March 31, available cash on hand was around $1 billion, but note that about $600 million was used to buy Buck in early April. So call it $400 million. This means we estimate that we have about $2 billion more to fund M&A for the rest of this year and our early look is another $3 billion or more in 2024 usually to fund our M&A program, utilizing only free cash and incremental debt while maintaining our strong investment grade ratings. One final reminder, recall during our March IR Day, we mentioned that we would be reclassifying how we present fiduciary balances on our balance sheet and in our cash flow statement. These re-classes are purely GAAP geography, and we're doing so to better align our presentation with how many other brokers present their statements. You might notice some of that movement in the recast balance sheet on page 12 of their earnings release. To help you understand all of the movement there'll be a comprehensive table in our 10-Q that we will file later next week. Again, all of this is to make our presentation more consistent with most of the other public brokers and all of the changes just gap geography. So those are my comments. Another terrific quarter and looking forward, we see strong organic growth, a great pipeline of M&A and continued opportunities for productivity improvements, all fueled by an amazing culture. I believe we are very well positioned to deliver another fantastic year. Back to you, Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, Doug. Operator, I think we're ready for some questions, please.\nOperator: Thank you. This call is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Weston Bloomer with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nWeston Bloomer: Hi. Good afternoon. My first question is on the margin expansion you're expecting for full-year 2023. How should we think about the cadence of that margin expansion as we move through the year? I think you'd previously guide to 1Q being lower relative to 2Q and 4Qs. Is that still largely the case excluding Buck or can you just help us think about the moving pieces as we go through the year?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Alright. So you're asking me about how do we fuel the margin extension quarter-to-quarter. Is that the question?\nWeston Bloomer: Yeah. More or less, because you highlighted some of the lumpy nature in organic. I'm just kind of curious on how that plays out on the margin as well.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Alright. Let me see if I can dig that out for you here. Should have it right here, and I apologize it's not quick on this. I think that -- stand by here. In the second quarter, I think that we'd probably have -- maybe the second and third quarter more flat and then a little bit more upside, maybe towards 30 basis points in the fourth quarter, I think, is what I'm looking at here.\nWeston Bloomer: And is there any seasonality to Buck's margin as well?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: I'm sorry. Let me check that. I just looked at there are 9, I'm seeing probably 10 basis points of expansion in the second quarter, 20 in the third and maybe 20 in the fourth.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. And does that include seasonality to Buck as well? I think you had previously said it was roughly run rate.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: That\u2019s right. That includes Buck.\nWeston Bloomer: Okay. Great. And can you can you give a sense to of how quickly Buck is growing? I see in the acquired revenue table that's, call it $77 million per quarter. I'm assuming that's including a few other deals in there, but I'm curious if that's assuming any growth for Buck or how quickly that business is currently growing?\nDouglas K. Howell: Yeah. This is [Indiscernible]. Buck has been pretty stable across the country last year, across the world last year. They have very strong growth in the U.K. and then their engagement last communications business. They just finished Q1 with their best sales quarter in the last five years. We're already beginning to have a lot of revenue synergy discussions, very organic early stages, built a pretty strong pipeline. We're already going on in on deals together. It's a little early to give predictions on what this looks like, but we do expect them to have mid-single digit growth this year.\nWeston Bloomer: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, Weston.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. My first question, maybe I'm just confused. I thought you said Brokerage margin, can expand 50 basis points sorry, 60 basis points to 80 basis points for the year. But then in response to Weston's question, you were talking about 10 basis points to 30 basis points of expansion over the next few quarters.\nDouglas K. Howell: All right. Question one is without the math that results from Buck because they run naturally lower margins. That was the question that we answered for, Weston. The 60 basis points to 80 basis points is how we're looking at Gallagher before Buck. Does that help?\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Got it. Yes. That helps. Thank you. And then in terms of the organic outlook, still kind of keeping the 79% range for the year. Can you just give us a sense of what you're embedding in there for the economy as well as pricing when you think about or you're just expecting a general stable environment over the next few quarters compared to what we saw in the Q1.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: I think, Elyse, this is Pat. I think that we're just sort of predicting that it's a stable environment over the next three quarters. We're not seeing a lot of rate reduction. We are seeing continued, and by the way, I'd point out being a little proud about this. We've been the one saying we're not seeing recessionary pressure in the middle market by our clients around the United States in particular. Those businesses are continuing to grow and they are robust, even with the headwinds of higher interest rates and higher insurance costs. And those insurance costs are not backing off, and we can tell you this data day-to-day, line-by-line, geography-by-geography, country-by-country. So, I think that our commentary in our prepared remarks about it being a pretty firm market, looking like it's going to continue that way for all the reason we enumerated, we view it that same way over the next three quarters.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks. That's helpful. And then you guys, I know right, the laws related to your clean energy investments right expired at the end of \u201821, and you guys have kind of I think, or kept some of the plants open. Is there still the potential that you guys could generate more tax credits there or have you kind of not expecting that at this point?\nDouglas K. Howell: We're preserving all the machines that allow us to generate those tax credits if there's something that might come out of an energy bill or a tax reconciliation bill yet this year. Those plants could be put back into service.\nElyse Greenspan: Do you think there's a high probability that could happen?\nDouglas K. Howell: Elyse, I don't know if there's a high probability of anything getting done in Washington. So I mean, that I would hope so, but I wouldn't put high probability on anything coming out of there. Yes, but if the plant sits there for another year, they sit there for another year.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks for the color.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Good. Thanks, Elyse.\nDouglas K. Howell: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Peters: Well, good afternoon, everyone.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Hey, Greg.\nGreg Peters: So, I think before I get into the results, I wanted to step back and just talk about talent recruiting and employee producer retention, and maybe if you could give us an update on how that's progressing inside Arthur J. Gallagher. And I guess in a parallel question, there was some recent announcements of promotions in the c-suite and, Pat, I don't think you, I think you have plenty of gas left in the tank, so maybe you could provide some context about some of those announcements as well.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Well, let me address a couple things first, Greg, so first, our recruiting efforts are ongoing. We are always recruiting producers, excited about the fact that our 500 interns will begin showing up in a few weeks here, in the United States, if I look around the globe, it's probably more like 600 interns. As you well know, we recruit heavily from that group, and our consistency of retention there is very strong, and continues to be strong. So, we have a good pipeline and a good -- we do a good job of landing new producers, nothing to announce in the way of any more robust efforts in that regard than are normal. And so I think I feel really good about that. In terms of retention of producers, very, very, very strong retention, and I think that we offer a great place to acquire trade, and we pay people well to do that. We're still one of the places that believes in remunerating people for their growth in books. So, I feel good about our production recruits. I feel good about our new hires, and I feel very good about the retention level that we have with the people that are. As it relates to the article, which was not an announcement, I would just simply say that we don't make a lot of comments on news stories, Greg, and I think you know that. I'm the CEO, and I feel great. Thank you very much.\nGreg Peters: I expected that kind of comment from you, so but thank you for validating it. I guess, my follow on question will deal with M&A. And I know you comment on this almost every quarter, but the interest rate environment has posed a changing landscape for M&A. We look at your multiples sits in the, Doug's CFO commentary tables, and it doesn't look like the multiples are changing much. Can you talk about how you view M&A at the current prices that are being in the marketplace? Do you think, you talk about the 40 term sheets or outstanding, it seems like you have 40 term sheets every quarter. But can you talk about, how the interest rate environment might change your perspective on what you're willing to pay?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Yes. I will. First of all, let me put some color on that. If I read the business insurance article correctly about a week ago, I think M&A in the first quarter is down about 29%. That's after year-after-year-after-year, more PE entries, more deals being done it's, so I think we're seeing a slowdown in the number of transactions, which I do think reflects a slowdown in the number of new entrance. There are some -- there are some people who have been very active in the past that are less active now. At present, we're not seeing a big decrease in those multiples. If you had 20 people bidding on a property 18 months ago, you still have 11 today. And so, I do believe that, like anything, supply and demand, if that demand continues to decrease and interest rates are in some way impinging that capital, I think that you will see multiples come down, but they're not doing that right now.\nGreg Peters: Got it. Thanks for the answers.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Zaremski: Hi, good afternoon. First question, in the prepared remarks, you talked about property rates accelerating. Any stats or any way we can dimension what percentage of your revenues on the Brokerage side, touch that element of acceleration and it doesn't seem like from your organic guide that you're taking in that acceleration continuing or maybe I'm incorrect?\nDouglas K. Howell: Well, listen I can give you some percentage of our book, our property book we include package in there also is going to be somewhere around just doing the mental math here real quick, is around 27%, something like that of our first quarter, total revenues in the P&C units. One of the things that our guys do is there and we all do out there is pretty good at mitigating some of that rate increase. So, when you look at it, property rates are going up 17%, you might see commissions going up 10% or 11%, 12% something like that because you increase deductibles, you bring down limits, you come up some more creative programs in that. So, that is a line of business where the direct correlation between the premium increase and then the commissions that we get there's a delta there.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: I think that's a -- I'm piling in here. This is, Pat. That's a very, very good point. Every time in a firm market, we get that question. Rates are up on XYZ 12%. You're showing 6%. Why is that? Because our job is to not pass on the 12%, and we're good at that.\nMike Zaremski: Got it. Okay. That's -- and that thanks for the answer, Doug, that excludes reinsurance?\nDouglas K. Howell: Yes. That's right. But most of our reinsurance are on renewal, so you've already seen that math.\nMike Zaremski: Got it. Okay. Follow-up investment income. Maybe I might have missed this, because I jumped on a minute late, but was there any help with if this is the right investment income run rate? I know that there might have been book sales in the number two. It looks like it was better than expected. I know there were some new -- there's some noise on the fiduciary balances too now. So, should you truly be thinking we need some help there?\nDouglas K. Howell: All right. So, book sales would have been tiny. I think the total amount of book sales this quarter was about 200,000 bucks, something like that. So that wouldn't have influenced it in our numbers, at all. Our investment income on the face of the financial statements also includes our premium funding businesses. So, you will -- so that the amount of invest income that translates right into that number. Just take 90% of what you see as investment income and on the face and 90% of that is real, additional incremental investment income. When you look at what it means for the rest of the year, if you follow the interest rates through the big tick-up starting about last month last year, and so second half of the year, the increase in investment income is not as dramatic as it is here in the first quarter. So, if I were to look at full year impact of investment income on our organic lift, that would be about maybe 60 basis points for full year, 60 basis points of margin expansion from invest income for the full year. So, you can see here this quarter was up fueled about 90 basis points and for the full year it would be about 60 basis points to 70 basis points, something like that.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Great. And maybe just, well, last quick one. Given how much improvement Gallagher has shown in its margins over the last few years. Is there a way to dimension what percentage of the deals you guys look at have a better margin profile than Gallagher, or should we expect there to, there to be up maybe similar like a Buck headwind sometimes going forward as you guys continue to do deals.\nDouglas K. Howell: No. I think if you look at our pipeline and you project it, we would think that if I were standing in January of next year looking back, what's to be the impact of rolling M&A excluding Buck. So, all it might use about 10 basis points to 20 basis points of margin expansion. So, it has a significantly smaller impact on the full year because we're so seasonally large in the first quarter.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from David Montemaden with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Montemaden: Hi. Thanks. I just had a question just on the margin. So, I've understand, Doug, so we got, the 90 basis point tailwind from fiduciary income here in the first quarter, maybe that ticks down for the full year, like 60 basis points sounds like Buck is about a 50 point headwind to offset that. And then, I guess, we have organic that should contribute 60 basis points to 80 basis points I guess. Could you talk about some of the other headwinds that are going to offset some of the margin expansion going forward? Because, yes, I'm struggling to get to the 20 basis points to 30 basis points this year.\nDouglas K. Howell: All right. So, maybe let me back-up and just say, and think about it this way. We built a bridge this quarter from last year first quarter, right? So, if we were look -- if we were standing in January of \u201824, looking at a year that we're kind of seeing in that organic in the 7% to 9% range, here are some of the components we've talked about already and I'll toss in a couple more. So, where we said that maybe investment income would give us 60 basis points, 70 basis points, 80 basis points of margin expansion for full year, but not the 90 basis points. We got to think about as the normalization of the Omicron T&E expenses and then maybe some inflation on other T&E throughout the year, but we were back to doing full business in the second half of last year. That may cost margin expansion, let's say a 30 basis points to 40 basis point. I told you about the rolling impact of regular tuck-in acquisitions excluding Buck that would maybe use 10 basis points to 20 basis points of margin expansion. That gives you organic maybe in that 70 basis points to a 100 basis points just pure organic without those things, 70 basis points to a 100 basis points of margin expansion. And then we are making some additional -- we provided some additional raises that we talked about last quarter. We are making some additional IT investments all those maybe $5 million to $8 million a quarter that would use maybe 20 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion. Again, these are ranges, follow that bridge for the full year and that gets you back to the 60 basis points to 80 basis points of FX adjusted margin expansion for the year. So, then you'd layer in Buck, and that would get you down to that margin expansion that you mentioned there. So, I hope that bridge, and I don't have a crystal ball, it's not January of next year, but you -- if that was type of range you get some from investment income, you get a lot from organic, some goes back because of T&E and the rolling impact has a little impact, and we're making some investments. So, if we ended up the year and ignored Buck being up 60 basis points to 80 basis points, knowing me in January next year, I'd probably point out that we would have expanded margins 600 basis points in five years, and knowing my personality, I probably would say that I still would feel confident that we would have more and more productivity opportunities as we look forward. So, a lot can change in nine months, but wouldn't that be a great year for us to post. So, that's those are kind of my thoughts on that, and I hope that helps all the listeners on this to understand that where the pieces are coming from and hopefully that will help you build your models.\nDavid Montemaden: Yes. That helps a lot. Thanks for that. I appreciate that, Doug. Maybe just a follow-up, Doug, I think you said you sounded, or you did say you were bullish on hitting that full-year organic in the 7 to 9 range after being a little bit above that this quarter. It sounds like renewal premiums are chugging along. The economy is also chugging along. Is it really just the tougher comps that is holding you back from increasing that outlook? Or is there anything else that I that we should think about that that's on your guys' mind as you were thinking about the organic growth outlook over the rest of the year?\nDouglas K. Howell: I think the accounting on the deferred revenue from 606 in the fourth quarter plus maybe a life cases. Now maybe we sell some more life cases that come in pretty lumpy. Those probably cost us 50 basis points. The combination of the two and full-year organic something like that. But one thing I will say is that when we look at our dailies, you know, these are the overnights where we get a scrape of all the renewals that are going on, I got to tell you, April looks a lot more -- looks stronger in terms of premium increases than we were seeing before even on a mix adjusted basis. There is a tone that we're seeing in our data, not from anecdotal polling, that there is some further strengthening in all lines and all geographies, maybe other than one or two smaller ones. So, who knows? Maybe we'll be close to the 9%, but we're still comfortable in that that 7% to 9% range.\nDavid Montemaden: Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then maybe if I could just sneak one more in for Scott. Just on the Gallagher asset non comp liability claims. Just it sounded like core underlying claims were up low single digits during the quarter. That was both in workers' comp on liability lines. I'm wondering on liability lines, is that up low single digits a significant change to how that core underlying claims level was running in the previous quarters?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: I mean there's a couple of things going on. One is we happen to be, if you look at kind of the new business we've been selling, it's been connected to more liability activity. So it's not necessarily that individual accounts are saying more. But the new business tends to be tilting a little bit in that direction.\nDavid Montemaden: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Hughes with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Hughes: Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Hey, Mark.\nDouglas K. Howell: Hey, Mark.\nMark Hughes: Pat, you've been pretty enthusiastic about what you're seeing around exposures. In the construction space, if banks are really tightening up, would you have started to see that? Would there be some early project work that would flow through your system. Do you have any kind of view on what you think will help or what will happen there given the banking crisis.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: So, Mark, I'm not sure I'm understanding the question. If I look in my data, is the question around what we're seeing in the construction risks that we ensure?\nMark Hughes: Correct. Any early signs of pressure because of the banking situation?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: In fact, if anything right now, construction continues to be pretty unrobust. First off, you've got, you do have a lot of infrastructure stuff that now is flowing through, and our infrastructure contractors are doing very well. And when you get down to the more -- to the smaller contractors, their backlog is strong.\nMark Hughes: Any observation about the carrier's willingness to pay claims with perhaps inflation in the system, are they tightening up there? And is that -- are you seeing that in your relationships with the carriers?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: No, I will say this. I'm proud of the industry market. One of the things that I think stays consistent is that our carriers and I'd say this on a broad based basis are paying the legitimate claims that they have filed with them. And I think they're paying them in a in a timely fashion, and I think they're paying them fairly. Now you can get to certain jurisdictions. I don't mind mentioning it. Florida was assignment of benefits and litigation on behalf of the claims, and there's a battle going on there. But by and large, when you put a legitimate claim into the system, the insurance industry is a very efficient model of paying that claim. We are not sitting there with a lot of complaints from our claimants.\nMark Hughes: Very good. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Shanker with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Shanker: Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in. I just want to ask one follow-up to Greg's question earlier. You gave a hypothetical path about and I did it. Let's say there were 18 bidders on the property. Maybe now there's only 11. I guess it was only hypothetical, but 11 still seems a lot to me. I'm wondering in the market today are there still a lot of bidders who are flush with cash? Are they raising debt in this environment to make the acquisitions? What's their funding that keeps them around?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Well, a, I don't understand it, and I'm not smart enough too. So let's start with that. And b, yes, they're raising funds like crazy. One of our competitors that I won't name actually eliminated their integration team and their acquisition team. Announced publicly that they were no longer going to be actively pursuing acquisitions, they've got additional funding and they're back in the game. Go figure out who would sell to that. Not me. So then you go to other players that have been more consistent long term. And, yes, they're they received significant funding in the last 60 days. So they are flush. That capital's got to work. They didn't get it to put it interest. So there's competition out there.\nJoshua Shanker: And in terms of the price they are paying, I mean, I've always felt that there's not really a big patching going on. People want to come in partners with Gallagher and it's a choice acquirer compared to some others. Is there evidence that certain sellers are willing to not consider certain bidders who might be less of an attractive acquirer?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Well, I think so. So, I mean, I think that's a big part of our sales, that we are always talking about the fact that the differentiator here is twofold. One, we believe we have a great franchise that offers them the opportunity to expand their business. And if they love the business or they tend to stay in it, this is the best platform in our mind to trade from. So that starts it. And then, of course, you've got the cultural aspect. And we're competitive. We're not we're not trying to sell the fact that that should give them a deep discount. But there are, you know, there are people that sell for various reasons, and we don't win them all.\nJoshua Shanker: Thank you for the answers. Appreciate it.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Sure, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Two sort of big picture questions if I can. First, Pat, you talked about within wholesale and specialty. Open brokerage is growing a lot faster than MGA and binding business. Is there something you could talk us through why there's that gap in growth rate?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Sure. I'll toss that to Joel. Go ahead, Joel.\nJoel D. Cavaness: Sure. So, on the wholesale side, obviously, you work with larger accounts and larger accounts that end up in the wholesale space typically are larger accounts with larger exposures and a little tougher to play. So that would be really the first. And then really the second thing is the inflow of tougher accounts today that are coming out of the admitted market and coming into the several lines market or E&S depending on what your terminology is, is more robust. They're coming in very quickly because of especially the difficulty in the property market. So you would see a higher organic in that line versus our MGA binding business, which is more consistent, growing nicely, but it's more consistent in the nature of smaller accounts. So it doesn't move the needle as much.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Look at it this way. Another way to put in Meyers, one is troubled business, frankly. When we're doing open market broker, brokers are coming to us because they need our help on tough to place accounts that are going up in price. Our MGAs and programs are consistently writing smaller accounts that are not distressed, that are looking for specialty coverage or specialty expertise.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. No. That's very helpful. Thank you. That's definitely what I needed. Second question, I'm just wondering how should we think about reinsurance growth over the next year or so. Is there sort of a special maybe temporary boost because it's now under sort of doubters purview, and you can explain the benefits of that to the insurance company that you deal with worldwide and then once that happens, you're on a stable basis? Or is that a more enduring first of upside?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: No, I think that's an enduring thing. When this team was part of our competitor, Willis, they had a very good block of business underneath them. A very good firm they were part of. And I would say in fact similar economic. So we're not we're not changing that. But I think we do offer a different environment. We offer a different way of trading. We're bringing our retailers together with the reinsurance people at a much higher level or I shouldn't say higher level at a much greater frequency with much greater interaction than they were used to, which I do believe will fuel their growth. And I think it will accelerate beyond what they would have achieved, but that's what it could have should and we'll never know.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, Meyer.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks. I just had one question on pricing. I think you all had commented previously that Australia, New Zealand are potentially seeing a reacceleration in rate and the UK is also seeming quite strong. So I'm just curious if you're seeing or expect to see more of a divergence in the pricing trajectory between, the U.S. and the international business.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: I think they're pretty close to the same. Yes we're seeing some of those, but we're seeing, take D&O out of it right now. We are starting to see some uptick in workers' comp now. So, I mean, I don't see a lot of difference between what's going on in the U.S. and what's going on Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the UK. So it's pretty close.\nRobert Cox: Got it. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the margin side and thanks for all the color on the moving pieces. But within that 20 to 30 basis points, are you assuming that the fiduciary investment income is in line with the Q1 level over the remaining three quarters?\nDouglas K. Howell: Yeah. That's pretty close. Yeah. That's right.\nElyse Greenspan: And then, you know, I know I had asked earlier kind of just a question just in terms of just it seems like you're assuming a stable economy. Right? We see some forecasts out there for decelerating GDP or perhaps GDP to go negative. What are you guys assuming for GDP over the balance of the year?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Well, here's the thing. Translating it directly into GDP is a different exercise But one thing, you got to separate real versus nominal first and foremost. So I can only get a look at what's the growth in the insured values and insured, what's being assured there. Remember, we're not seeing that in our data right now. I'm looking down through our industry list right now, and we talked about construction earlier, heavy construction other than building construction contractors up 12.4%, construction special trade 8%, building construction up 8%. So you look through our industry list here, we're not seeing it. We're not seeing it in our dailies overnight. The cancellations are lower than before. Negative endorsements are lower than before. Audits are audits. They have a lag factor in there, so I wouldn't look at those two terribly carefully. But we're just not seeing this in our customer\u2019s business at this point. And believe me, our customers, if they believe they're seeing a down turn one of the things they want to do is modify their insurance program because that's cash flow to them. So, we will know in two years how accurate our dailies are. But right now, they are pretty right over the last two years.\nElyse Greenspan: And so even, I guess, if we still like, if you were thinking about what's going to have the greater impact, do we think about it being the economy and GDP or PNC pricing when we think about the next few quarters?\nDouglas K. Howell: Both.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: But I think the pricing will far offset any modest contraction and exposure in it. I don't know what's going to contract in the next six months or what volumes are going to contract. We're just not seeing at least.\nDouglas K. Howell: But remember, Elyse, we are the beneficiary of inflation. There are very few industries out there that really get a benefit from inflation, and we do. So as building values go up and for and right now for the first time in the decade, carriers are very, very interested in what you're insure to make sure you're ensuring the value. This inflation is hitting building costs very hard.\nElyse Greenspan: Thanks for all the color.\nDouglas K. Howell: Thanks, Elyse.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Montemaden with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Montemaden: Hi. Thanks for taking my follow-up. So I've noticed the last few quarters just in the adjusted compensation ratio commentary in brokerage. Just the impacts from savings related to back office headcount controls. Could you maybe just touch on that? I'm assuming some of this has to do with leveraging centres of excellence. But I don't think you had mentioned that as a tailwind when we think about the margin roll forward. So, I guess maybe just help me think through that, maybe not only for this year, but, like, broader picture. How big of an opportunity that is leveraging the centres of excellence.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Well, maybe we back up and take a look. Do you remember some of our discussion about the sensitivity of our business to inflation? We said about 40% of it is neutral because it just moves more in tandem with premium -- with our commission rates because we pay people on incentive compensation basis there. Then we've got about 40% of our whole cost structure that is moderately impacted by inflation. And then we have 20% of it that might run a little bit more close to what headline is inflation knocking off some tops of certain things that maybe transportation, gas, etcetera on that. So when you add all that up, when you look at what could be facing an -- somebody like us that's pushing $6 billion worth of cost. If something if you say that, let's say, let's call it 30% of your \u2013 25% of your cost structure is subject to \u2013 75% of the headline inflation number. Just think about that. Let's say there's $4 billion, I'm just doing this off the top of my head that might have 6% or 7% inflation factor in it. That's a big number. Right? And I'm saying that the only thing that's really affecting us is $5 million to $8 million bucks a quarter on it. What that's saying is as we get more productive, not just from our offshore centres of excellence, but because of technology and other process improvements that are both domestic and offshore centres of excellence. That is absolutely controlling against inflation out there. So there is substantial uplift that's happening every day because of our productivity work, our quality work and our offshore centres of excellence. And I just kind of did that off the top of my head, but you get the point. You'd see a heck of a lot more cost or expense dropping into the bottom line if we didn't have our offshore centres of excellence.\nDavid Montemaden: Got it. Nope. That makes sense. Thank you for that.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.: Sure. We're pretty proud of the quality that comes out of that operation too. Well, thank you very much everyone. Appreciate that and thank you for joining us today. As you could tell, we're extremely pleased with our start to the year. We posted a great quarter. I'd like to thank all our colleagues for their outstanding efforts this quarter. We are people business and I believe we have the best people at Gallagher. We look forward to speaking with you again at our IR Day in June. Have a nice evening, and thanks for being with us.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr.",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings call. On the call for today is Doug Howell, our CFO as well as the heads of our operating divisions. We had an excellent first quarter to start the year. For our combined brokerage and risk management segments, we posted 12% growth in revenue, 9.7% organic growth. GAAP earnings per share of $2.52, adjusted earnings per share of $3.30 up 12% year-over-year. Reported net earnings margin of 21%, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 38% up 29 basis points. We also completed 10 mergers totaling $69 million of estimated annualized revenue and we are recognized as the world's most ethical company for the thirteenth time, an outstanding quarter from the team. Let me give you some more detail on our first quarter performance starting with our Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 12%. Organic was 9.1%. Acquisition rollover revenues were $61 million. Adjusted EBITDAC growth was 15% and we posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 40.4% right on our March IR Day expectations. A fantastic quarter for the brokerage team. Let me walk you around the world and provide some more detailed commentary on our brokerage organic. Starting with our retail brokerage operations. Our U.S. PC business posted over 7% organic. Core new business was up year-over-year, even growing over the tough renewal compare in D&O lines, while retention was similar to last year's first quarter. Our UK PC business also posted more than 7% organic due to strong new business production, stable retention and the continued impact of renewal premium increases. Our combined PC operations in Australia and New Zealand posted organic of 10%. Net new versus loss business was consistent with prior year and renewal premium increases were ahead of first quarter 2022 levels. Rounding out the retail PC business, Canada was up 6% organically reflecting solid new business and consistent year-over-year retention. Our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of nearly 7%. New business remains strong and client retention was excellent. We saw growth across many of our practice groups with particular strength in HR consulting and pharmacy benefits. Shifting to our wholesale and specialty businesses. Risk placement services, our U.S. Wholesale operations posted organic of nearly 8%. This includes 16% growth in open brokerage and about 5% organic in our MGA programs and binding businesses. New business production and retention were both consistent with last year's first quarter. UK specialty posted organic of 17% benefiting from a strong start within aviation and the addition of new teams focused on North American risks. And finally, reinsurance, Gallagher posted 12% organic reflecting new business wins, great retention and a hardening property reinsurance market. Outstanding results from the Gallagher Re team. Pulling it all together Brokerage segment all in organic of 9.1% that's a bit above the top end of our first quarter expectation and a fantastic sales quarter by the team. Next, let me provide some thoughts on the PC insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Overall, global first quarter renewal premiums that's both rate and exposure combined were up more than 9% consistent with the 8% to 10% renewal premium change we had been reporting throughout 2022. Renewal premium increases remain broad based across nearly all of our major geographies and product lines around the globe. For example, workers' comp is up low single digits, general liabilities up mid to high single digits. Umbrella and package are up in the low double digits, so most lines are trending similar to previous quarters. Two exceptions. First, public D&O where renewal premiums are down a bit and second property, where renewal premium increases are accelerating. For example, fourth quarter property renewal premiums were up 15% and through the first three months of 2023, we have seen increases of 15%, 20%, and 17%, respectively. So, our clients continue to feel cost pressures here due to rising replacement values, increasing frequency and severity of weather related events and hard reinsurance conditions. We're not seeing signs that these lost costs and profitability pressures are likely to abate in the near term. So as we head to our largest primary insurance property quarter we are focused on helping our clients navigate and mitigate these premium increases. Moving to exposures. We are seeing continued strength in our customer's business activity. First quarter mid-term policy endorsements audits and cancellations combined were better than first quarter 2022 levels greater than the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year increases. Shifting to reinsurance. During the heavy Japan centric April renewals, reinsurance carriers continued to focus on increased pricing and tightening terms and conditions. This was across a broader range of territories and most all lines of business, so in even harder conditions compared to January 1. The casualty trading market saw orderly renewals and a sufficient supply of capital to fulfill the demand from underwriting enterprises. The property market continued to experience its recent challenges due to more limited underwriting capital. There were some green shoots in the ILS issuance, although pricing was typically less attractive to CDs than the traditional markets. Overall, there wasn't much new capacity entering the property market regardless, our teams navigated the hard market and customers again managed to secure satisfactory cover. Those interested in more detailed commentary can find our April first view market report at our website. Looking forward, there is good reason to expect a cautious underwriting stance from carriers for the foreseeable future as they contemplate recent weather events, replacement cost increases, social inflation and ongoing geopolitical tensions into their view of lost cost trend. So we expect insurance and reinsurance pricing increases to continue throughout 2023 and while it's early likely into 2024. We also remain optimistic on our customer's business activity during 2023. We have yet to see any significant shifts to daily indications of client, business activity thus far in April. We are also seeing encouraging employment levels for our benefits clients suggesting the economic backdrop for 2023 remains broadly favorable. Recent data shows the U. S. Unemployment rate declining. Continued growth in non-farm payrolls and a very wide gap between the amount of job openings and the number of people unemployed and looking for work. So I see demand for our products and services around attracting, retaining, and motivating workforces remaining strong. As we sit here today, we continue to see full-year 2023 brokerage segment organic in that 7% to 9% range and that would be another fantastic year. Moving on to mergers and acquisitions. We had an active first quarter completing 10 new tuck in brokerage mergers representing about $69 million of estimated annualized revenues. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Also in April, we officially welcomed the former Buck colleagues, combined with our existing employee benefits brokerage and HR consulting business we will enhance our offerings and be better positioned to deliver superior human capital solutions for all of our clients. Moving to our pipeline, we have nearly 40 term sheets signed or being prepared representing more than $350 million of annualized revenue. Good firms always have a choice of who to partner with, and we'll be very excited if they choose to join Gallagher. Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher asset. First quarter organic growth was 14.3% ahead of our expectations due to continued growth from recent new business wins and some revenue from first quarter New Zealand cyclone and flooding. We also saw core new arising claims increase in the low single digits during the quarter for existing clients across both workers' comp and liability. First quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was also strong at 19.2% ended up a bit ahead of our March expectations. Looking forward, we see full-year 2023 organic around 12% to 13% and adjusted EBITDAC margins holding up or above 19% and that would be another excellent year. And I'll conclude with some comments regarding our Bedrock culture. I'm very pleased that just a few weeks ago, we were recognized as the World's Most Ethical Companies for the thirteenth time. We're honored to be one of only 135 companies globally to receive this award from the Ethisphere Institute. Our 45,000 plus colleagues embrace and celebrate the unique values that we have instilled in our company. The 25 tenants articulated in the Gallagher way continue to drive our global team's success today and we believe that our unique culture is a key differentiator and a competitive advantage. It's a strong culture of client focus, excellence, and inclusion and it continues to drive us forward. That is the Gallagher way. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thanks, Doug. Operator, I think we're ready for some questions, please. Alright. So you're asking me about how do we fuel the margin extension quarter-to-quarter. Is that the question? Alright. Let me see if I can dig that out for you here. Should have it right here, and I apologize it's not quick on this. I think that -- stand by here. In the second quarter, I think that we'd probably have -- maybe the second and third quarter more flat and then a little bit more upside, maybe towards 30 basis points in the fourth quarter, I think, is what I'm looking at here. I'm sorry. Let me check that. I just looked at there are 9, I'm seeing probably 10 basis points of expansion in the second quarter, 20 in the third and maybe 20 in the fourth. That's right. That includes Buck. Thanks, Weston. I think, Elyse, this is Pat. I think that we're just sort of predicting that it's a stable environment over the next three quarters. We're not seeing a lot of rate reduction. We are seeing continued, and by the way, I'd point out being a little proud about this. We've been the one saying we're not seeing recessionary pressure in the middle market by our clients around the United States in particular. Those businesses are continuing to grow and they are robust, even with the headwinds of higher interest rates and higher insurance costs. And those insurance costs are not backing off, and we can tell you this data day-to-day, line-by-line, geography-by-geography, country-by-country. So, I think that our commentary in our prepared remarks about it being a pretty firm market, looking like it's going to continue that way for all the reason we enumerated, we view it that same way over the next three quarters. Good. Thanks, Elyse. Hey, Greg. Well, let me address a couple things first, Greg, so first, our recruiting efforts are ongoing. We are always recruiting producers, excited about the fact that our 500 interns will begin showing up in a few weeks here, in the United States, if I look around the globe, it's probably more like 600 interns. As you well know, we recruit heavily from that group, and our consistency of retention there is very strong, and continues to be strong. So, we have a good pipeline and a good -- we do a good job of landing new producers, nothing to announce in the way of any more robust efforts in that regard than are normal. And so I think I feel really good about that. In terms of retention of producers, very, very, very strong retention, and I think that we offer a great place to acquire trade, and we pay people well to do that. We're still one of the places that believes in remunerating people for their growth in books. So, I feel good about our production recruits. I feel good about our new hires, and I feel very good about the retention level that we have with the people that are. As it relates to the article, which was not an announcement, I would just simply say that we don't make a lot of comments on news stories, Greg, and I think you know that. I'm the CEO, and I feel great. Thank you very much. Yes. I will. First of all, let me put some color on that. If I read the business insurance article correctly about a week ago, I think M&A in the first quarter is down about 29%. That's after year-after-year-after-year, more PE entries, more deals being done it's, so I think we're seeing a slowdown in the number of transactions, which I do think reflects a slowdown in the number of new entrance. There are some -- there are some people who have been very active in the past that are less active now. At present, we're not seeing a big decrease in those multiples. If you had 20 people bidding on a property 18 months ago, you still have 11 today. And so, I do believe that, like anything, supply and demand, if that demand continues to decrease and interest rates are in some way impinging that capital, I think that you will see multiples come down, but they're not doing that right now. Thanks, Greg. I think that's a -- I'm piling in here. This is, Pat. That's a very, very good point. Every time in a firm market, we get that question. Rates are up on XYZ 12%. You're showing 6%. Why is that? Because our job is to not pass on the 12%, and we're good at that. I mean there's a couple of things going on. One is we happen to be, if you look at kind of the new business we've been selling, it's been connected to more liability activity. So it's not necessarily that individual accounts are saying more. But the new business tends to be tilting a little bit in that direction. Hey, Mark. So, Mark, I'm not sure I'm understanding the question. If I look in my data, is the question around what we're seeing in the construction risks that we ensure? In fact, if anything right now, construction continues to be pretty unrobust. First off, you've got, you do have a lot of infrastructure stuff that now is flowing through, and our infrastructure contractors are doing very well. And when you get down to the more -- to the smaller contractors, their backlog is strong. No, I will say this. I'm proud of the industry market. One of the things that I think stays consistent is that our carriers and I'd say this on a broad based basis are paying the legitimate claims that they have filed with them. And I think they're paying them in a in a timely fashion, and I think they're paying them fairly. Now you can get to certain jurisdictions. I don't mind mentioning it. Florida was assignment of benefits and litigation on behalf of the claims, and there's a battle going on there. But by and large, when you put a legitimate claim into the system, the insurance industry is a very efficient model of paying that claim. We are not sitting there with a lot of complaints from our claimants. Thanks Mark. Well, a, I don't understand it, and I'm not smart enough too. So let's start with that. And b, yes, they're raising funds like crazy. One of our competitors that I won't name actually eliminated their integration team and their acquisition team. Announced publicly that they were no longer going to be actively pursuing acquisitions, they've got additional funding and they're back in the game. Go figure out who would sell to that. Not me. So then you go to other players that have been more consistent long term. And, yes, they're they received significant funding in the last 60 days. So they are flush. That capital's got to work. They didn't get it to put it interest. So there's competition out there. Well, I think so. So, I mean, I think that's a big part of our sales, that we are always talking about the fact that the differentiator here is twofold. One, we believe we have a great franchise that offers them the opportunity to expand their business. And if they love the business or they tend to stay in it, this is the best platform in our mind to trade from. So that starts it. And then, of course, you've got the cultural aspect. And we're competitive. We're not we're not trying to sell the fact that that should give them a deep discount. But there are, you know, there are people that sell for various reasons, and we don't win them all. Sure, Josh. Sure. I'll toss that to Joel. Go ahead, Joel. Look at it this way. Another way to put in Meyers, one is troubled business, frankly. When we're doing open market broker, brokers are coming to us because they need our help on tough to place accounts that are going up in price. Our MGAs and programs are consistently writing smaller accounts that are not distressed, that are looking for specialty coverage or specialty expertise. No, I think that's an enduring thing. When this team was part of our competitor, Willis, they had a very good block of business underneath them. A very good firm they were part of. And I would say in fact similar economic. So we're not we're not changing that. But I think we do offer a different environment. We offer a different way of trading. We're bringing our retailers together with the reinsurance people at a much higher level or I shouldn't say higher level at a much greater frequency with much greater interaction than they were used to, which I do believe will fuel their growth. And I think it will accelerate beyond what they would have achieved, but that's what it could have should and we'll never know. Thanks, Meyer. I think they're pretty close to the same. Yes we're seeing some of those, but we're seeing, take D&O out of it right now. We are starting to see some uptick in workers' comp now. So, I mean, I don't see a lot of difference between what's going on in the U.S. and what's going on Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and the UK. So it's pretty close. Sure. Well, here's the thing. Translating it directly into GDP is a different exercise But one thing, you got to separate real versus nominal first and foremost. So I can only get a look at what's the growth in the insured values and insured, what's being assured there. Remember, we're not seeing that in our data right now. I'm looking down through our industry list right now, and we talked about construction earlier, heavy construction other than building construction contractors up 12.4%, construction special trade 8%, building construction up 8%. So you look through our industry list here, we're not seeing it. We're not seeing it in our dailies overnight. The cancellations are lower than before. Negative endorsements are lower than before. Audits are audits. They have a lag factor in there, so I wouldn't look at those two terribly carefully. But we're just not seeing this in our customer's business at this point. And believe me, our customers, if they believe they're seeing a down turn one of the things they want to do is modify their insurance program because that's cash flow to them. So, we will know in two years how accurate our dailies are. But right now, they are pretty right over the last two years. But I think the pricing will far offset any modest contraction and exposure in it. I don't know what's going to contract in the next six months or what volumes are going to contract. We're just not seeing at least. Thanks, Elyse. Well, maybe we back up and take a look. Do you remember some of our discussion about the sensitivity of our business to inflation? We said about 40% of it is neutral because it just moves more in tandem with premium -- with our commission rates because we pay people on incentive compensation basis there. Then we've got about 40% of our whole cost structure that is moderately impacted by inflation. And then we have 20% of it that might run a little bit more close to what headline is inflation knocking off some tops of certain things that maybe transportation, gas, etcetera on that. So when you add all that up, when you look at what could be facing an -- somebody like us that's pushing $6 billion worth of cost. If something if you say that, let's say, let's call it 30% of your \u2013 25% of your cost structure is subject to \u2013 75% of the headline inflation number. Just think about that. Let's say there's $4 billion, I'm just doing this off the top of my head that might have 6% or 7% inflation factor in it. That's a big number. Right? And I'm saying that the only thing that's really affecting us is $5 million to $8 million bucks a quarter on it. What that's saying is as we get more productive, not just from our offshore centres of excellence, but because of technology and other process improvements that are both domestic and offshore centres of excellence. That is absolutely controlling against inflation out there. So there is substantial uplift that's happening every day because of our productivity work, our quality work and our offshore centres of excellence. And I just kind of did that off the top of my head, but you get the point. You'd see a heck of a lot more cost or expense dropping into the bottom line if we didn't have our offshore centres of excellence. Sure. We're pretty proud of the quality that comes out of that operation too. Well, thank you very much everyone. Appreciate that and thank you for joining us today. As you could tell, we're extremely pleased with our start to the year. We posted a great quarter. I'd like to thank all our colleagues for their outstanding efforts this quarter. We are people business and I believe we have the best people at Gallagher. We look forward to speaking with you again at our IR Day in June. Have a nice evening, and thanks for being with us."

            "name": "Douglas K. Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon everyone. As Pat said, an excellent start to the year. Today, I'll begin with some comments using both our earnings release and our CFO commentary document that we post on our website. I'll touch on organic margins and provide some modeling helpers for the remainder of 2023. Then I'll finish up with my typical comments in cash, M&A capacity and capital management. Okay. Let's flip to page 2 of the earnings release. All in brokerage organic of 9.1%. Call it right at the top end of the range we foreshadowed at our March 16th IR Day, a nice finish from our London specialty operations and a little upside from reinsurance benefits. One call out on that table. Contingence didn't grow organically this quarter for three reasons. First, there's a little geography between supplementals and contention call that about $2 million. Second, there was a bit of positive development in Q1 2022 from the prior year 2021 estimates. Call that $3 million and again, that's back in first quarter 2022, causing a little difficult compare. And third, we are not expecting one of our programs to pay as large of a contingent here in 2023 because of underlying loss ratio deterioration. Call that maybe towards a million. Regardless, base organic at 9.5% and all in at 9.1% that's a fantastic quarter by the team. Hoping to page 4 of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. We posted 40.4% for the quarter, before FX, that's up 56 basis points. And FX adjusted up 14 basis points over first quarter 2022. That's right in line with our March IR Day expectations when we discuss that first quarter 2022 expenses were lower than our expected run rate simply because we are still in the Omicron portion of the pandemic and that our tuck in acquisitions are just not as seasonally weighted. But they don't roll in at 40 points of margin here in the first quarter. If you levelize for those two items, our margins expanded approximately 110 basis points. Maybe looking at it like a bridge from first quarter 2022 will be helpful. Investment income gave us 90 basis points of margin expansion. The normalization of Omicron T&E expenses and inflation on all T&E costs us 80 basis points. The seasonal impact from rolling M&A uses about 40 basis points. Organic gave us 70 basis points of expansion and some additional wages and IT investments used about 25 basis points. Follow that bridge and the mass gets you close to that 14 basis points of FX adjusted expansion in the quarter. Looking forward, it's still early yet with a fantastic first quarter combined with pass up commentary makes us more bullish on hitting that full-year brokerage organic in the 7% to 9% range and posting adjusted margins up 60 basis points to 80 basis points. Two small heads up on that. First, getting to that 7% to 9% organic for the full-year might be a little lumpy over the next three quarters given the large life case we sold in Q2 2022. And then the 606 deferred revenue accounting in our fourth quarter. We discussed both of those with you last year, so there's no new news here. Just a reminder for your modeling. Second, the 60 to 80 basis points of margin expansion is before the roll in impact of Buck, which recall naturally runs lower margins. So when you include Buck, the math would show full year margin expansion in that 20 to 30 basis points range. So moving on to the Risk Management segment and the organic table at the bottom of page 4. As Pat said, an excellent quarter, 14.3% organic growth We did get a little tailwind this quarter because Omicron caused fewer claims arising in Q1 2022 and we also had some New Zealand [CAC] (ph) claims activity. But most of this excellent result comes from strong new business wins in the second half last year. As for margins, put to page 5 of the earnings release. Risk Management posted adjusted Q1 EBITDAC margins of 19.2%. That's up 177 basis points over last year. As we look forward, we're seeing the rest of the year organic in that 12% to 13% range and full-year margins now finishing a bit above 19%. That would be the best full-year adjusted margin in Gallagher asset six decade history. Another demonstration of the benefits of scale, intellectual capital, technology and operational excellence. Let's turn to page 6 of the earnings release. That's our Corporate segment and also, when you take a look at pages 3 and 4 of the CFO commentary document, most all of the items are right in line with our March IR Day forecast. Three callouts on the CFO commentary document. When you see Page 3, you'll see a slight tick up in our expected book effective tax rate. That's entirely due to the UK rate hike to 25% that went effective April 1st. But remember what you're seeing is a book effective tax rate. Our cash taxes paid rate is substantially lower. Call that around 10% of our adjusted combined brokerage and risk management EBITDAC. That's because of the tax shield from interest, the amortization of purchase intangibles and the incremental cash flows from our clean energy investments over the coming years. Page 5 of the CFO commentary shows those tax credits. We have over $700 million as of March 31st, and it shows that we're forecasting to use about a $180 million to $200 million in 2023 with a step up in 2024 in each later year. That's a really nice cash flow sweetener to help fund future M&A. Then if you flip back to page 4 of the CFO commentary document, you'll see that we had a slight beat on the Corporate segment this quarter compared to our midpoint, but some timing in that beat. So you'll see full-year still about the same as what we forecasted our March IR Day. Moving now to page 6 of the CFO commentary document, that table shows our rollover M&A revenues. It shows $61 million this quarter, which is pretty close to that $63 million we estimated during our March IR Day. And also looking forward, we've now included Buck in that table, but remember, you'll need to add your pick for other future M&A to these estimates. Let me move to some comments on cash, capital management and future M&A. At March 31, available cash on hand was around $1 billion, but note that about $600 million was used to buy Buck in early April. So call it $400 million. This means we estimate that we have about $2 billion more to fund M&A for the rest of this year and our early look is another $3 billion or more in 2024 usually to fund our M&A program, utilizing only free cash and incremental debt while maintaining our strong investment grade ratings. One final reminder, recall during our March IR Day, we mentioned that we would be reclassifying how we present fiduciary balances on our balance sheet and in our cash flow statement. These re-classes are purely GAAP geography, and we're doing so to better align our presentation with how many other brokers present their statements. You might notice some of that movement in the recast balance sheet on page 12 of their earnings release. To help you understand all of the movement there'll be a comprehensive table in our 10-Q that we will file later next week. Again, all of this is to make our presentation more consistent with most of the other public brokers and all of the changes just gap geography. So those are my comments. Another terrific quarter and looking forward, we see strong organic growth, a great pipeline of M&A and continued opportunities for productivity improvements, all fueled by an amazing culture. I believe we are very well positioned to deliver another fantastic year. Back to you, Pat. Yeah. This is [Indiscernible]. Buck has been pretty stable across the country last year, across the world last year. They have very strong growth in the U.K. and then their engagement last communications business. They just finished Q1 with their best sales quarter in the last five years. We're already beginning to have a lot of revenue synergy discussions, very organic early stages, built a pretty strong pipeline. We're already going on in on deals together. It's a little early to give predictions on what this looks like, but we do expect them to have mid-single digit growth this year. All right. Question one is without the math that results from Buck because they run naturally lower margins. That was the question that we answered for, Weston. The 60 basis points to 80 basis points is how we're looking at Gallagher before Buck. Does that help? We're preserving all the machines that allow us to generate those tax credits if there's something that might come out of an energy bill or a tax reconciliation bill yet this year. Those plants could be put back into service. Elyse, I don't know if there's a high probability of anything getting done in Washington. So I mean, that I would hope so, but I wouldn't put high probability on anything coming out of there. Yes, but if the plant sits there for another year, they sit there for another year. Thanks, Elyse. Well, listen I can give you some percentage of our book, our property book we include package in there also is going to be somewhere around just doing the mental math here real quick, is around 27%, something like that of our first quarter, total revenues in the P&C units. One of the things that our guys do is there and we all do out there is pretty good at mitigating some of that rate increase. So, when you look at it, property rates are going up 17%, you might see commissions going up 10% or 11%, 12% something like that because you increase deductibles, you bring down limits, you come up some more creative programs in that. So, that is a line of business where the direct correlation between the premium increase and then the commissions that we get there's a delta there. Yes. That's right. But most of our reinsurance are on renewal, so you've already seen that math. All right. So, book sales would have been tiny. I think the total amount of book sales this quarter was about 200,000 bucks, something like that. So that wouldn't have influenced it in our numbers, at all. Our investment income on the face of the financial statements also includes our premium funding businesses. So, you will -- so that the amount of invest income that translates right into that number. Just take 90% of what you see as investment income and on the face and 90% of that is real, additional incremental investment income. When you look at what it means for the rest of the year, if you follow the interest rates through the big tick-up starting about last month last year, and so second half of the year, the increase in investment income is not as dramatic as it is here in the first quarter. So, if I were to look at full year impact of investment income on our organic lift, that would be about maybe 60 basis points for full year, 60 basis points of margin expansion from invest income for the full year. So, you can see here this quarter was up fueled about 90 basis points and for the full year it would be about 60 basis points to 70 basis points, something like that. No. I think if you look at our pipeline and you project it, we would think that if I were standing in January of next year looking back, what's to be the impact of rolling M&A excluding Buck. So, all it might use about 10 basis points to 20 basis points of margin expansion. So, it has a significantly smaller impact on the full year because we're so seasonally large in the first quarter. All right. So, maybe let me back-up and just say, and think about it this way. We built a bridge this quarter from last year first quarter, right? So, if we were look -- if we were standing in January of \u201824, looking at a year that we're kind of seeing in that organic in the 7% to 9% range, here are some of the components we've talked about already and I'll toss in a couple more. So, where we said that maybe investment income would give us 60 basis points, 70 basis points, 80 basis points of margin expansion for full year, but not the 90 basis points. We got to think about as the normalization of the Omicron T&E expenses and then maybe some inflation on other T&E throughout the year, but we were back to doing full business in the second half of last year. That may cost margin expansion, let's say a 30 basis points to 40 basis point. I told you about the rolling impact of regular tuck-in acquisitions excluding Buck that would maybe use 10 basis points to 20 basis points of margin expansion. That gives you organic maybe in that 70 basis points to a 100 basis points just pure organic without those things, 70 basis points to a 100 basis points of margin expansion. And then we are making some additional -- we provided some additional raises that we talked about last quarter. We are making some additional IT investments all those maybe $5 million to $8 million a quarter that would use maybe 20 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion. Again, these are ranges, follow that bridge for the full year and that gets you back to the 60 basis points to 80 basis points of FX adjusted margin expansion for the year. So, then you'd layer in Buck, and that would get you down to that margin expansion that you mentioned there. So, I hope that bridge, and I don't have a crystal ball, it's not January of next year, but you -- if that was type of range you get some from investment income, you get a lot from organic, some goes back because of T&E and the rolling impact has a little impact, and we're making some investments. So, if we ended up the year and ignored Buck being up 60 basis points to 80 basis points, knowing me in January next year, I'd probably point out that we would have expanded margins 600 basis points in five years, and knowing my personality, I probably would say that I still would feel confident that we would have more and more productivity opportunities as we look forward. So, a lot can change in nine months, but wouldn't that be a great year for us to post. So, that's those are kind of my thoughts on that, and I hope that helps all the listeners on this to understand that where the pieces are coming from and hopefully that will help you build your models. I think the accounting on the deferred revenue from 606 in the fourth quarter plus maybe a life cases. Now maybe we sell some more life cases that come in pretty lumpy. Those probably cost us 50 basis points. The combination of the two and full-year organic something like that. But one thing I will say is that when we look at our dailies, you know, these are the overnights where we get a scrape of all the renewals that are going on, I got to tell you, April looks a lot more -- looks stronger in terms of premium increases than we were seeing before even on a mix adjusted basis. There is a tone that we're seeing in our data, not from anecdotal polling, that there is some further strengthening in all lines and all geographies, maybe other than one or two smaller ones. So, who knows? Maybe we'll be close to the 9%, but we're still comfortable in that that 7% to 9% range. Hey, Mark. Yeah. That's pretty close. Yeah. That's right. Both. But remember, Elyse, we are the beneficiary of inflation. There are very few industries out there that really get a benefit from inflation, and we do. So as building values go up and for and right now for the first time in the decade, carriers are very, very interested in what you're insure to make sure you're ensuring the value. This inflation is hitting building costs very hard. Thanks, Elyse."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2024 earnings call. On the call for you today is Doug Howell, our CFO, other members of the management team and heads of our operating divisions. Before I get to my comments about our financial results, I\u2019d like to acknowledge the damage and devastation caused by the recent storms and floods. Our thoughts are with those impacted by these events, including our own Gallagher colleagues. Our professionals are hard at work helping clients sort through their coverages, file claims and ultimately get losses paid. I\u2019m really honored to be part of a company in an industry with such an important responsibility, helping families, businesses, and communities rebuild and restore their lives and that\u2019s a noble cause. Okay, on to my comments regarding our financial performance. We had a great third quarter. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 13% growth in revenue, 6% organic growth, which does not include interest income. Reported net earnings margin of 15.5%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.9%, up 123 basis points year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share of $1.90 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.72, up 16% year-over-year. Another fantastic operating quarter by the team. Moving to results on a segment basis, starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 13%. Organic growth was right in line with our expectations at 6%, which, as we forecasted, reflects about a point of timing headwind from those large life cases we have highlighted over the past couple of quarters. Doug will provide you with some good news from October related to these sales in his remarks. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 137 basis points to 33.6%, which was better than our IR Day expectations. Let me give some insights behind our Brokerage segment organic. Within our PC retail operations, we delivered 5% in the U.S. and 7% outside the U.S. Internationally, Australia and New Zealand led the way with organic of more than 10%. The U.K. was up 6% and Canada was flattish. Our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of about 4%, and a few points higher, excluding the timing differences from the large life case sales. Shifting to our reinsurance wholesale and specialty businesses, overall organic of 8%. So very strong growth, whether retail, wholesale or reinsurance. Next, let me provide some thoughts on the PC insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Global third quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure were up 5% and little change from the 6% we discussed at our September IR Day update a few weeks ago. Most lines and geographies had very similar renewal premium changes through all three months of the quarter, with a couple of exceptions. September casualty renewal increases outside the U.S. were lower relative to July and August, driven by changes in business mix. Additionally, large account and E&S property renewal premium increases were a bit less in September than the first two months of the quarter. But neither of these appear to be a trend. Thus far in October, we\u2019re seeing large account property and international casualty renewal premium increases higher than September. Breaking down third quarter renewal premium changes by product line, we saw the following. Property up 4%, general liability up 6%, commercial auto up 7%, umbrella up 10%, workers comp up 2%, D&O down about 5%, cyber was flat and personal lines up 11%. So overall, increases continue to be broad-based and rational in our view, with carriers still cautious and pushing for rate where it\u2019s needed to generate an acceptable underwriting profit. We shine in this environment. Our job as brokers is to help clients find the best coverage while mitigating premium increases. So while not all the increases ultimately show up in our organic, a rational market allows us to further differentiate ourselves with our leading tools, data and expertise. Let me shift to the reinsurance market. The July 1st renewal season saw modest property price declines concentrated at the top end of reinsurance towers, while casualty renewals saw terms and conditions tighten, and some modest price increases concentrated in the U.S. Clearly, a lot has happened in the property market over the past month, which is now adding some complexity to January 1st property renewals. It\u2019s still early, but we now believe a flattish renewal is more likely than the downward pressure previously being discussed. And don\u2019t forget, U.S. hurricane season is not over for another month. For casualty risks, we believe reinsurance will remain cautious heading into next year, especially if there is more noise related to U.S. reserve adequacy. We think differentiating underwriting practices will likely be the key to a successful renewal for clients. Overall, the reinsurance industry remains adequately capitalized and is likely to meet capacity demands at the upcoming January 1 renewals. We continue to believe Gallagher Re will perform very well in 2025, regardless of how the market environment unfolds in the near-term. Moving to some comments on our customers\u2019 business activity. Our daily revenue indications from audits, endorsements and cancellations were again in positive territory for the third quarter. While the amount of upward revenue adjustments isn\u2019t as much as 2023, they\u2019re running in line with 2022. So client business activity remains solid and we are not seeing any signs of meaningful global economic slowdown. Within the U.S., the labor market is on solid footing. In fact, the number of open jobs increased in August and remained well above the number of unemployed people looking for work. Overall job growth, upward wage pressure and rising medical cost inflation continue to challenge employers looking for ways to grow their workforce and control their benefits costs. Regardless of market or economic conditions, I believe we are well positioned to take market share across our Brokerage business. Remember, about 90% of the time we are competing against the smaller local broker that cannot match our client value proposition, niche expertise, outstanding service and our extensive data and analytics offerings. Putting this all together, we continue to see full year 2024 Brokerage organic around 7.5% and that would be another outstanding year. Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Revenue growth was 12%, including organic of 6%. We continue to benefit from excellent client retention, increases in customer business activity, rising claim counts, and new business wins. Adjusted EBITDAC margin was 20.8%, 35 basis points higher than last year, and a bit above our September IR Day expectation. Looking ahead, we see organic in the fourth quarter around 7% and full year organic pushing 9%. Margins for fourth quarter and full year should be in the 20.5% range, and that, too, would be another outstanding year. Shifting to mergers and acquisitions. During the third quarter, we remain disciplined, completing four new mergers at fair prices representing $47 million of estimated annualized revenue. For those new partners joining us, I\u2019d like to extend a very warm welcome to the Gallagher family of professionals. Looking ahead, we have more than 100 mergers in our pipeline, representing approximately $1.5 billion of annualized revenue. Of these 100 potential partners, we have about 60 turn sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $700 million of annualized revenue. Good firms always have a choice and it would be terrific if they chose to partner with Gallagher. Let me conclude with some comments regarding our culture. As we passed our 40th anniversary as a public company, I believe our greatest differentiator continues to be our bedrock culture. It\u2019s a culture that runs towards problems, not away from them. A culture that supports one another and embraces teamwork. A culture that is grounded in the highest standards of moral and ethical behavior. It\u2019s a culture that will continue to guide our success for many years to come. Frankly, we love this business. We enjoy taking care of our customers and that is the Gallagher way. Okay, I\u2019ll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll walk you through our earnings release. First, I\u2019ll comment on third quarter organic growth and margins by segment. Then I\u2019ll provide an update on how we are seeing organic growth and margins shape up for fourth quarter and provide an early look on 2025. Next, I\u2019ll move to the CFO commentary document that we post on our IR website and walk you through our typical modeling helpers. And I\u2019ll conclude my prepared remarks with my usual comments on cash, M&A and capital management. Okay, let\u2019s flip to Page 3 of the earnings release. Headline Brokerage segment third quarter organic growth of 6% without interest income. That\u2019s right in line with our September IR Day forecast during which we signaled about a point of headwind due to the timing of large life sales. Recall that these life products are interest rate sensitive. So, as we\u2019ve been discussing, clients were waiting for lower interest rates. Well, the good news Pat mentioned happened over the last month or so. We are now seeing clients fund their policies. In fact, here in October, we have already caught up more than half of what had slipped from earlier quarters. So, the quarterly lumpiness that we have been highlighting throughout the year is starting to swing the other way here in October. And thus, we are currently seeing fourth quarter organic towards 8% and full year pushing 7.5%. As we start to budget for 2025, our early thinking is Brokerage segment full year organic growth might be in the 6% to 8% range. If so, that could mean a 2025 similar to how 2024 might ultimately play out. We\u2019ll provide some more on our 2025 thinking at our December IR Day. But an early read through is we remain upbeat on our ability to grow given the investments we have been making in the business from adding niche experts to rolling out new sales and support tools to expanding our data and analytics offerings. We believe these actions are leading to higher new business production and strong client retention across the globe. And as Pat described, the market environment is still a tailwind for us. Flipping now to Page 5 of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDA table. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.6%, up 137 basis points over last year and above the upper end of our September IR Day expectations. Let me walk you through a bridge from last year. First, if you pull out last year\u2019s 2023 earnings -- third quarter earnings release, you would see we reported back then adjusted EBITDA margin of 32.4%. But now using current period FX rates, that would have been 32.2%. Then organic and interest gave us nearly 150 basis points of expansion this quarter. Finally, the impact of M&A and divestitures used about 10 basis points of margin this quarter. You follow that and that will get you to third quarter 2024 margin of 33.6% and that\u2019s the 137 basis points of Brokerage margin expansion. That is really, really great work by the team. As we look ahead to fourth quarter 2024, we are still expecting margin expansion in the 90-basis-point to 100-basis-point range. And again, that would be off of fourth quarter 2023 adjusted margin for FX, which currently is estimated to be about 20 basis points lower than last year\u2019s headline margin of 31.6%. If we do that, that would mean full year 2024 could show about 70 basis points of margin expansion and 90 basis points excluding the first quarter impact from the roll in of the Buck merger. Okay. Let\u2019s move on to the Risk Management segment and the organic and EBITDA tables on Pages 5 and 6. It was another solid quarter. We posted organic of 6%. That\u2019s a point lower than our IR Day guidance because we just missed qualifying for a full revenue bonus related to one large account. That said, Gallagher Bassett continues to see excellent client retention and strong new business production and still delivers an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.8%, which is up 35 basis points over prior year and ahead of our IR Day expectation. Looking forward, we see organic of 7% and margins around 20.5% in the fourth quarter. If we were to post that, we would finish the year with organic pushing 9% and margins of approximately 20.5%. That too would be great work by the team. As for 2025, our early thinking is for organic growth similar to the Brokerage segment, call it in that 6% to 8% range. Turning now to Page 6 of the earnings release in the Corporate segment shortcut table. In total adjusted third quarter numbers for interest and banking, clean energy and acquisition costs came in within our September IR Day expectations. The corporate line of the Corporate segment was below our expectations due to approximately $9 million of additional unrealized non-cash foreign exchange re-measurement expense that developed during September and wasn\u2019t included in our IR Day forecast. After tax, call it about $0.03. That has already reversed here in October. So it really is a non-cash nothing in our opinion. But the accounting does cause some noise. Let\u2019s now move to the CFO commentary document. Starting on Page 3, modeling helpers. There\u2019s no new news here other than FX. So just consider these updated revenue and EPS impacts as you update your models. Turning to the Corporate segment on Page 4 of the CFO commentary document. No change to our outlook for fourth quarter. Flipping now to Page 5 to our tax credit carryforwards shows $796 million at September 30th. While this benefit won\u2019t show up in the P&L, it does benefit our cash flow for the next few years which helps us fund future M&A. Turning to Page 6, the investment income table. We are now embedding two 25-basis-point rate cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024 and have updated our estimates in this table for current FX rates. Punchline here is our fourth quarter estimate does not change much from what we provided at our September IR Day. Shifting down that page to the rollover revenue table, the third quarter 2024 column subtotal is $111 million and 141 million before divestitures. These are consistent with our September IR Day expectations. Looking forward, the pinkish columns to the right include estimated revenues for Brokerage M&A closed through yesterday. So just a reminder, you\u2019ll need to make a pick for future M&A. And when you move down on that page, you\u2019ll see the Risk Management segment rollover revenues for fourth quarter 2024 are expected to be approximately $15 million. So moving to cash capital management and M&A funding. Available cash on hand at September 30 was about $1.2 billion. Considering this balance and our strong expected free cash flow, we are in an excellent position to fund our robust pipeline of M&A opportunities here in 2024. We currently estimate capacity of around $3 billion for M&A here in 2024 and is looking like we could have another $4 billion to fund M&A in 2025, all while making solid -- maintaining a solid investment grade rating. So it\u2019s another excellent quarter in the books. Through the first nine months of the year for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we have delivered revenues up 16%, organic growth of 8%, net earnings of up 20%, adjusted EBITDA up 18% and adjusted EPS up 17%. Those are terrific numbers and reflect an unstoppable culture. We are well on our way to another great year of financial results. Hats off to the team for all of their hard work. So back to you, Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Doug. And operator, if we could go to questions-and-answers, please.\nOperator: Sure. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Zaremski: Hey. Thanks for the questions. First one is on the bridge from, in the Brokerage segment from 3Q organic to 4Q organic to kind of at the 2-point uplift sequentially. Is -- are you saying most of that is life insurance and if not, it sounded like RPC was still kind of more muted, but are you saying RPC is kind of, is lifting off into, is trending higher into 4Q? Just trying to understand some of the pieces there?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: All right. So I think when you, renewal premium changes is what you\u2019re referring to as RPC, I\u2019m assuming.\nMike Zaremski: Yeah.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: We\u2019re not seeing underlying that our rates, that what we\u2019re seeing for rates are not different all that much in the third quarter at all compared to what we saw in the first two quarters. And I think you\u2019re seeing that in a lot of the carrier releases right now too. So rates for the fourth quarter, we\u2019re assuming about the same as what we\u2019re seeing here, yeah, in the third quarter, which is the same as in the first and the second. As for the increase next quarter, yes, we are getting about a point of additional organic growth from the life insurance sales. But when you bake all this in, we think that we\u2019re running around 7.5% in our business right now. That\u2019s the underlying growth. When you take out the puts and takes quarter-to-quarter, yeah, we\u2019re nicely in that 7% to 8% range.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Got it. So no other seasonality or anything there, okay.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: We are a little slower in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s not as big a quarter for reinsurance for us. And that has been an organic leader over the last couple of years. So, yes, we do have a little bit of that impact because we\u2019re not so heavily weighted in the fourth quarter to reinsurance.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. All right. That makes sense. Okay. Switching gears a bit to, I guess, the margins or just if I look at the fiduciary investment income, looks like it was much better than expected. But I think you\u2019re guiding down. What caused the spike and why is it expected to go back down?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I think, you have to look at our premium funding business there. So when you take a look at the table on Page 6 of the earnings release, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve changed our estimates all that much for the, excuse me, of the CFO commentary. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve changed our comments all that much for the fourth quarter.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Okay. Got it.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: You also realize there can be some times where we have, obviously, fluctuations in our fiduciary cash balances, too, that can impact that number.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Got it. And I guess just, Doug, as a follow-up to some of the comments you made earlier on renewal price change. So actually, from a number of the carriers we\u2019ve seen so far, we have seen an uptick on the casualty side in terms of pricing. And I know in the past, too, you guys have had a view that what you\u2019re hearing from carriers is that they\u2019re under earning on some of the major casualty lines. So is that still kind of in your thought process, as you think that you gave us some tidbits on how 2025 could play out, that there could be some price hardening on the casualty side?\nDoug Howell: There\u2019s definitely some price concern on casualty across the board. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll filter into discipline on their part to continue to take it up more than we\u2019re presently seeing. But as you heard us earlier, umbrella is presently rising at about 10%. The only line in casualty that seems to have a difficult time finding bottom is D&O. The rest, however, are showing strength.\nMike Zaremski: Yeah. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah. I just got one number here. Our U.S. business, our casualty lines are up a 4-point third quarter versus second quarter.\nMike Zaremski: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Cox: Hey. Thanks. So appreciate all the guidance on the Brokerage organic. I was just curious about the components. I think in the beginning of this year, you guys had talked about maybe it was a third, a third, a third exposure, new business and pricing. I was just curious how you guys expect that might unfold in 2025.\nDoug Howell: I think it\u2019s going to be half new business in excess of lost business and I think that it\u2019s going to split the rest of it between exposure and rate.\nRob Cox: Okay. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Yeah. Just curious, maybe it\u2019s a little bit tough to go through all the comments, but it seemed like maybe international retail decelerated a little bit more than the U.S. this quarter. I guess I was just curious also on your views between international and U.S. Retail going into next year.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I think you\u2019re going to see strong international growth. That\u2019s where our strongest component is right now and that does not seem to be backing off. So, if you look at our prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we\u2019re a good part of our growth this quarter was international considering finance.\nDoug Howell: Yeah. I mean, our Australia and New Zealand operations killed it this quarter. So, they\u2019re up nicely. Canada\u2019s a little flattish. I mean, if you\u2026\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah.\nDoug Howell: \u2026 want to do that, if you look at the U.K., there was a mixed issue there in the third quarter also that you could see through. But by and large, I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s tatters anywhere that are causing us concern.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: International is up 10% this quarter. And Doug\u2019s comment\u2019s right. The lead by New Zealand and Australia.\nRob Cox: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nDoug Howell: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi. Thanks. Good evening. My first question, embedded within your fourth quarter guidance, the 8% Brokerage organic, is there any assumption for an impact on continued commissions from the recent storms?\nDoug Howell: Yeah. We don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be heavily impacted, maybe a couple million bucks from the storms. But that wouldn\u2019t move that. Maybe it moves at 10 basis points.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then within the guidance, right, I think, you guys said 6% to 8% Brokerage for next year. Are you assuming -- what are you assuming for the benefits business, right? I understand there was some seasonality this year. Are you just assuming it\u2019s kind of in line with the rest of the segment? I know you typically wait a little longer to give the bi-segment guidance, but just because that\u2019s brought on some volatility this year, I wanted to get a sense of where you think that will head next year?\nDoug Howell: Listen, if you want to pick the midpoint of that range, maybe benefits is around 5% and reinsurance is around 9%, something like that, when you\u2019re looking for a couple points on either side of the midpoint.\nElyse Greenspan: For next year.\nDoug Howell: Yeah. For next year.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then, with the M&A, I know like yield flow rate has probably been a bit lighter through the first three quarters, right, then what we\u2019ve seen in prior years. Do you guys think, just given it\u2019s a presidential election year, has that caused, I guess, a slowdown in just the closing of transactions and are you expecting more activity in the fourth quarter early next year? How do you guys see things on that front?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, I think if you take a look at -- this is Pat. If you take -- if you look at the general marketplace in terms of acquisitions, there\u2019s been a bit of a slowdown in general across the Board for the last year. We\u2019ve got a great pipeline. In my experience, we\u2019ve got one of the best pipelines we\u2019ve ever had. So I think that possibly when the discomfort, if you want to call it that or concentration on this election finally ends, clearly if the Democrats get in, I think there could be a rush for the door. I don\u2019t know what happens in the case the Republicans win, but at any rate, I think when things settle out, we do think there\u2019ll be continued great opportunity and I do think that there\u2019ll be a return to a little bit more robust market.\nDoug Howell: Yeah. I think we are going to be -- I think if you looked at a year-to-date in 2021, we were closing around 17 and 2022, we closed 19. Year-to-date 2024, we\u2019re at 27. Yeah, last year we closed 37 year-to-date with these tucked in deals acquisitions. So it was a little slower this quarter, but I think as you heard from Pat\u2019s pretty detailed comments, our pipeline is terrific right now.\nElyse Greenspan: And then one last one on like that corporate line within the Corporate segment, Doug. I thought you said that it was worse, right, than September IR Day because of the FX re-measurement, but that reversed in the fourth quarter, but then the Q4 guide\u2026\nDoug Howell: That\u2019s right.\nElyse Greenspan: \u2026 for Corporate did change. Are you just not modeling that in yet?\nDoug Howell: Yeah. That\u2019s a good point. We might be a little bipolar on that. We might have been able to schedule a couple extra pennies on that line for the reversal of what we saw at the end of the third quarter, but that bounces around quite a bit. So I think that we\u2019ll see what happens again. So we just didn\u2019t feel like for a couple pennies it was worth changing that number.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Elyse.\nDoug Howell: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nGregory Peters: Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Just building on your\u2026\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hi, Greg.\nGregory Peters: Yeah. Building on your last answer on acquisitions, one of the things that struck out or stuck out to me, I should say, is when I was going through the supplement was the weighted average multiple for tuck-in pricing of acquisitions came down a lot in the third quarter. Is there any -- maybe you can just help me understand what happened, why the multiple came down, because I don\u2019t feel like multiples are coming down in the marketplace. And Pat, in your prepared remarks, you seem to emphasize your price discipline a little bit more than usually referenced in talking about tuck-in acquisitions?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah. When we prepared the remarks, Greg, we did discuss whether in the past we\u2019d been undisciplined. What I said\u2026\nGregory Peters: Understood.\nDoug Howell: Yeah. No, I think it\u2019s just a good reminder. We have a lot of people listening to these calls, our own people included, and a lot of acquisitions, we try to maintain a good discipline around the pricing and we seem to strike a fair balance between that and the great people that join us.\nGregory Peters: And the multiple for the third quarter acquisitions came down materially. It\u2019s like I felt like\u2026\nDoug Howell: Yeah. I think\u2026\nGregory Peters: \u2026 I took a step back in time.\nDoug Howell: One of those acquisitions was not priced, what I would say, it was priced a little under market because we have some opportunity to help get better.\nGregory Peters: Okay. Another sort of nitpicking item, you were going through your earnings press release and I was going through the adjustments to earnings to get your adjusted EBITDA. I\u2019m Page 5 of Brokerage. And one of the things that stuck out to me is just the huge jump up in workforce and lease termination related charges in the year, this year versus last year, and the third quarter versus the third quarter last year. Is there something going on, on a bigger scale? Is this more offshoring that\u2019s going on or maybe you could just help, I know it\u2019s a small item inside your income statement, but maybe you could just give us a sense of what\u2019s going on in that place?\nDoug Howell: Greg, I\u2019m sorry. Go ahead.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I was just going to say, Greg, you hit on the offshoring thing is really continues to be a very strong play for us and you\u2019ll recall years ago, we started with a very small group. We\u2019re 12,500 people strong there now and as we do acquisitions and go across the Board, illustrating the type of quality and the speed with which we can do things like issue certificates, there\u2019s pretty quick adoption. It\u2019s pretty good.\nDoug Howell: Yeah. I think you\u2019re seeing -- Greg, you\u2019re starting to see the flywheel just getting stronger and stronger as we benefit from scale, we benefit from technologies that we\u2019re deploying and we\u2019re benefiting from our offshore standards of excellence. It just gives us an opportunity to continue to optimize our workforce. And so, I think you\u2019re seeing that this quarter, yeah, popped up a little bit, because we have some opportunities to optimize our workforce. So, you\u2019ll see that from time-to-time.\nGregory Peters: Great. And then just step back, macro question, and this will be the last one. I know your commercial customers set their budgets for the year. In the past, given the robust rate increases that you\u2019ve had to sell, it seems like the market\u2019s beginning to stabilize a little bit more than, say, for it was two years ago. How are the budgets -- when you hear from your customers, how are the budgets changing for their insurance spend? Is it -- you\u2019re seeing more flat budgets? Are you still seeing them assume\u2026?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: No.\nGregory Peters: \u2026 increases? Give us a sense of what\u2019s going on there.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Really not flat, Greg, for two reasons. Exposure units, thankfully, are continuing to grow. This is why we go through our daily review of the things that are coming through audits, et cetera. We\u2019re seeing a robust economy and that\u2019s clearly in a big part of the middle market. And so, from SME all the way through large accounts, we\u2019ve got the data on that. People are expanding their exposure units, so budgets are going up. Secondly, we\u2019re very, very cautious. We are not leading customers to believe that there\u2019s any kind of nirvana relative to rates. That is not what\u2019s happening. We show them our detail that we go over with you quarterly. Property is up 4%. General liability is up 6%. You may not deserve that. That may not hit your P&L. But on the other hand, you may deserve 25%. And this is a rational market and we\u2019ve got to talk through that, which leads us right into discussing how much you retain, what you bring back into the coverage stack that you might not have had before. And that\u2019s where the real strength and art of being a broker is, is understanding that appetite for risk that each individual account has, working with those primary buyers to decide how they\u2019re going to get their best spend and it\u2019s not a discussion all around rate by any means.\nDoug Howell: Yeah. I think you take the chaos out of the pricing cycle and have this rational pricing cycle that we\u2019re seeing right now. Our guys will show the tools and capabilities that we have, and that will shine through and differentiate ourselves. That\u2019s why when I said before that I see a better new business versus lost business year next year than we\u2019ve even seen in the last couple of years.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: And by the way, to that point, Greg, we can take clients into our data now and I think you know this. We can say clients like you buy this and their quotes and cover looks like this. And by the way, their costs are this. Well, why is that? Think about selling or buying a house on the street. One\u2019s been taken care of, looks pretty darn good, has street appeal. The other looks like junk. Guess who gets the better price? Why don\u2019t we try to get you looking more like the house on the street people want to buy? And that, back to my point of art, is what it\u2019s all about to be a good broker and that\u2019s why when we get a rate environment like this, I feel very confident talking to our salespeople about we better see some increased sales, folks. Let\u2019s go.\nGregory Peters: Fair enough. Thanks for the answers.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Dean Criscitiello with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\nDean Criscitiello: Hi. I was hoping if you guys could provide maybe some additional color on the sequential decrease in the organic growth in Brokerage, especially in the context of that renewal premium change holding up pretty strong sequentially.\nDoug Howell: Well, listen, I think, I said earlier that, our first quarter is strong, because it\u2019s a heavy reinsurance quarter, right? We\u2019ve talked about some of the life insurance being a little lumpy. But if you bounce those two things out of there a little bit, again, we\u2019re running around 7.5% organic growth each quarter. So while it looks like that on the face, yes, we\u2019re at 6% now, but we warned that there was a 4-point of headwind against that. Also, we\u2019re not seeing substantial rate differentials, rates between the quarters. So really underline it when you carve out the seasonality of a couple of our businesses, some of the mixed differences between when property renews versus when casually renews, the life lumpiness. You got to take our word for it. It\u2019s pretty steady underlying other than that those things that I\u2019ve said. So it\u2019s pretty steady right now underlying.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah. And if you want to go back three years or four years, D&O is up 300%. So by line, by geography, these rates do make a difference. They move. So we\u2019re not seeing a D&O renewal anywhere near 300%. In fact, it\u2019s off 5% or 6%. So the percentages do move. This is not an environment where you say for the next 10 years, good news is it\u2019s 4% a quarter, bing, bang, boom.\nDean Criscitiello: Got it. That makes sense. And then my second one, a few of your competitors have made some large acquisitions to help, improve their middle market capabilities. And I was wondering what implications do you think that have on the competitive environment going forward, sort of being that you guys are a dominant player in that space?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I don\u2019t think it has any impact, to be perfectly blunt, on our business at all.\nDean Criscitiello: Okay. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Dean.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nMark Hughes: Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. Doug, did you give early margin thoughts for 2025 for Brokerage and Risk Management?\nDoug Howell: I have not. I will in December as we go through the budget. But I will say this, we post 6% to 8% organic growth next year. It\u2019s there, Mark. There\u2019s an opportunity for us to continue to get better. Our scale advantages are coming through our technologies, using the offshore centers of excellence. It still gives us an opportunity in an environment that we\u2019re seeing with current wage inflation, with current inflation and in other categories of our spend, that we continue to have opportunities to get better and better. And when you\u2019re punching out 6% to 8% organic growth, the underlying margins will absolutely have opportunity for expansion.\nMark Hughes: Very good. And then, did you give organic, broken out by the wholesale components and then reinsurance? I think you might have given those collectively at up 8%. But do you happen to have the components of that?\nDoug Howell: Yeah. Listen, some of like our affinity businesses might be at 12%. Some of our program businesses might be around that 6%. I think our open brokerage is somewhere around 9% -- 8% or 9%. The reinsurance is somewhere around 8% or 9% this quarter. So I would say other than a couple, maybe the affinity business just a little better this quarter and maybe the program business just a little below that 8%. But the reason why we lumped them together and it was just to shorten the script, but there\u2019s not a lot of difference when you\u2019re looking at around 8%.\nMark Hughes: Understood. And then any comment, Pat, on the mixed shift out of admitted into the E&S line?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah. I think it\u2019s very -- it\u2019s a really interesting one, Mark. I think we\u2019re seeing continued tremendous submission supply into our wholesaling operation RPS that has not slowed down, which is really interesting and we are not seeing accounts flowing back to the primary market in any great extent. So the excess and surplus market, which we know has gobbled up a big chunk of the P&C market over the last five years, 10 years, seems to be continuing its growth and it\u2019s maintaining its accounts. And I think that\u2019s, we\u2019ve got people in RPS that bring more than just pricing to the deal. There\u2019s a lot of expertise there. There\u2019s a lot of layering and structuring that goes into some of these deals that your local retailer, ourselves included, quite honestly, 50% of our wholesale business goes to RPS. That\u2019s for a reason. So I think it\u2019s both professional capabilities, as well as market access, and that market is still growing nicely.\nMark Hughes: Thank you very much.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Alex Scott with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Scott: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I mean, when I hear what you\u2019re saying about reinsurance and the strength and growth there, the wholesale business seems like it\u2019s growing very nicely as well. When I look at the 6% and I guess run rating closer to 7% and change, but does that mean, I guess, it obviously means that the businesses other than reinsurance and wholesale, like the more core retail is doing something lower. Is there anything that\u2019s causing some of the price there to not flow through? Is that just maybe some of the property deceleration we saw? I\u2019m just trying to understand, that piece of it specifically. What are some of the trends you\u2019re seeing and puts and takes headed into next year for the core retail piece of it?\nDoug Howell: Yeah. Always keep in the back of your mind our benefits business. That business is running around 5%. Take out the large life cases and stuff that bounce around a little bit. So as that -- as you think about those that are above that, 7% range. Yeah, you\u2019ve listed them, but you also have to remember that the benefit businesses naturally runs down below that, that level. Some of our actuarial services businesses run a little bit lower than that. But as I look across the organic, across all the operating, we mentioned that Canada was about flat. But by and large, there\u2019s a few that offset each other. But it\u2019s not like there\u2019s any one particular area that is systemically running below that level right now.\nAlex Scott: Got it. And maybe if we can go back to reinsurance. I mean, the growth rate you\u2019re anticipating sounds pretty robust there despite the flight pricing. And I just want to see if you could add some color around that. I mean, does that have to do with demand? Can you talk a bit about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of your clients\u2019 demand for reinsurance?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah. I think demand seems very, very strong, which is good news for us. Also, I think our level of expertise in helping clients in a market environment where there is capacity and they can move around how they play in that capacity. It\u2019s a very strong demand for our consulting capabilities around reinsurance. What\u2019s the next move for the carriers that are our customers? So you have both. You\u2019ve got demand. I think you have more utilization. There\u2019s strong growth at the primary level and all that flows up into the funnel for reinsurance. And as one of the top three players in that business, we have a lot of good prospects on the list.\nAlex Scott: Great. Thanks for the responses.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Sure. Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Our next question is from Katie Sakys with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKatie Sakys: Hi. I apologize. Thank you for the question. There might be some background noise. There\u2019s a fire going on right now. I want to circle back to the subject of valuations. You\u2019re thinking about acquisitions in the middle market that are really concentrated in excess of $15 million of revenue. We\u2019ve seen a couple of those lately and the multiples on those deals have been a lot higher than we\u2019ve seen in the past. I was curious how that compares to what you guys are seeing for those larger middle market deals and whether your appetite to participate in larger acquisitions has shifted at all?\nDoug Howell: Listen, I think that there\u2019s no question the larger you are, probably the higher the multiple might be for somebody that\u2019s out there looking for an opportunity. But when we look at our tuck-in acquisitions, I think that people understand that we\u2019ll pay a fair price. And the advantage is they get to stick with us. They come in and they get to work inside of a broker. It\u2019s a broker selling to a broker. They understand that if they decide to take our stock, that they get to participate in equal form as you do, as I do, as Pat does, everybody else in this room. It\u2019s one stock for every person. They get our resources. They get to put their employees and their clients into an environment where actually joining us is going to deliver considerably more career value and more insurance value to their customers. So many times they look at it and they say that they get the opportunity to continue on doing what they\u2019re going to do and so they get excited about a 10, 11 or 12 multiple. That\u2019s the reality about it, is they\u2019re making a great return for their family. And they know they get to continue doing it with us for as long as they would like to do in their career and that\u2019s valuable to them, too. Don\u2019t forget that.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Let\u2019s also take a look at the landscape. We don\u2019t talk about this, I think, enough because the big deals get big headlines and they are big platforms. We estimate there\u2019s 29,000 agents and brokers in America. Last year, business insurance -- last July, business insurance ranked the top 100 in the United States. Number 100 did $30 million in revenue. So there\u2019s 28,900 brokers in America. That\u2019s firms, not people, that are out there trading. And that\u2019s why we say 90% of the time, which continues to be consistent over the last decade, when we compete in the marketplace, we\u2019re competing with somebody smaller. And it\u2019s probably less than 10% of the time, really, that we\u2019re competing with Marsh and Aon, who are the only larger brokers in the world today. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t compete. There\u2019s a robust market at the top end. When you think about that, we can use our funds, as Doug says, at lower multiples. We can have 100 of these opportunities in our pipeline. We can be pricing out 70 of them and possibly put on a $1 billion of revenue with people that want to join us, haven\u2019t joined somebody else, want to bring their culture and their people aboard a culture that fits and matches theirs. As Doug said, a Brokerage run by brokers. It doesn\u2019t get the press, but it seems like a pretty good strategy and a good use of our cash does.\nKatie Sakys: Got it. Thank you so much for the comment.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yeah. You better evacuate, Katie.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Motemaden: Hey. Good evening. I just had a question in Brokerage and the contingents were up 24% on an organic basis. I was wondering if you could just talk about what was driving that in the quarter.\nDoug Howell: Yeah. Listen, I think that when you\u2019re talking about that, it\u2019s another $7 million or $8 million of where it developed from. We just had, between our benefits business and our U.S. Retail business, that\u2019s where we picked up a few extra contingents in the quarter or our estimation for those contingents in the quarter. So there was nothing special in there. Again, we might give a couple million of that back next quarter because of the storms and floods, but by and large, it -- I would say around the possibility of what could have happened, it was a few million dollars in both of those businesses.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just a bigger picture question. I heard the commentary on the term sheets being prepared or in the process of getting signed with $700 million of revenues. Do you have any stats historically on just how many of those are closed, like what percentage of those closed in the next year? Just to help us level set how much the contribution could be going forward?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I really don\u2019t. Here\u2019s the thing. Every one of these is a very interesting story unto itself. You\u2019ve heard me say, I think the longest time we spent talking to a client, talking to a prospect and getting to know each other was 20 years. Sometimes they happen in a quarter. Sometimes they take a couple of years. And but when we get to pricing and we get to putting together a letter of intent, we\u2019re getting serious. And that\u2019s a deal that\u2019s going to get decided in the next six months. I don\u2019t really have a stat on how many of those do close, how many don\u2019t. It\u2019s a full-on sales process. It\u2019s just like selling insurance, frankly. If you don\u2019t have a lot in the hopper, you\u2019re not going to close a lot.\nDavid Motemaden: Yes.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: We feel very good about these 60. You can ask me this every quarter and I will try to give some color. Right now, we feel very good about the deals that we\u2019re proposing right now. I would think we\u2019d have a good shot at an awful lot of those.\nDavid Motemaden: Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. And then just finally, so it sounded like the U.S. Retail, P&C organic, it sounded like that slowed a little bit. I think it was 5%, if I heard that right, and I think it was 6% last quarter. Was that just the large account property business that you were talking about that has reaccelerated here in the fourth quarter?\nDoug Howell: Yeah. Listen, I\u2019m just looking at my sheet here. If it moved, it moved a 0.5 point one way or another. We did have more. First quarter was just a little bit better than that, but second quarter is about the same number as what we\u2019ve got right now.\nDavid Motemaden: Great. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Grace Carter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nGrace Carter: Hi, everyone. I was hoping we could talk about the contingents a little bit more. Just given the ongoing conversation around the casualty market, I was wondering how you all are thinking about any potential risk of maybe some of the pressures from the casualty line that we saw in contingents last quarter resurfacing over the next few months?\nDoug Howell: If it did, we\u2019re talking a few million bucks. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t call that as being a systemic issue that we\u2019re going to have to face. Just like with the storms, it\u2019s a few million. There are some corridors, that -- we do have caps in our contingents. And so sometimes, if there is -- if the carriers have, let\u2019s say, maybe loss -- more losses than they had hoped, it may still let us get to our full contingent level because there\u2019s caps on that. So, right now, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of pressure from that, not only in our past book, but as we look forward in the book. If carriers continue to strengthen their casualty rates the way they have been and what we\u2019re hearing from them, what we\u2019re reading about what they\u2019re saying, it should maintain our contingent level also.\nGrace Carter: Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on the lumpy life sales. If I\u2019m understanding correctly, you all are expecting pretty much all of the timing issue to work itself out in 4Q or should we expect any sort of lagging impact from that in early 2025 as well?\nDoug Howell: What I said is already here in October, we have recouped half of what had been the timing that had come out of this first quarter and second quarter, excuse me, second quarter and third quarter. So we\u2019re going to pick up. So far, it\u2019s half. We think that we\u2019ve got a pipeline maybe to recover it all between now and the end of the year and then we\u2019ll start over again. Just like every other sales organization, we got to start over next year and go out there and see if we can gin up some opportunities. But this product is becoming more and more necessary for many not-for-profits in order for them to be competitive in their executive benefit package. So this is a product that we think has long legs over the next many years -- several or many years.\nGrace Carter: Thank you.\nDoug Howell: Thanks, Grace.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Zaremski: Oh! Great. Just a quick follow-up on life insurance. So just ballpark, what percentage of your Brokerage revenues are life insurance and I don\u2019t know if you want to break it out into this new product that might be more lumpy or just growing faster over time than traditional life?\nDoug Howell: The lumpy business that we\u2019re talking about is about $125 million business.\nMike Zaremski: Okay. Okay. And -- okay, that helps explain why it could move organic that much. Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all. Thanks.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Mike. I think that\u2019s it, Operator. Thank you again, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We had an excellent third quarter and we\u2019re well on our way to delivering another excellent year of financial performance. I\u2019d like to thank our 55,000 colleagues around the globe for their hard work and dedication to our clients. We look forward to speaking with you again in person at our December Investor Meeting in New York City. Thank you very much for being with us this evening. We\u2019ll talk to you then.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Doug Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our earnings release. First, I'll comment on third quarter organic growth and margins by segment. Then I'll provide an update on how we are seeing organic growth and margins shape up for fourth quarter and provide an early look on 2025. Next, I'll move to the CFO commentary document that we post on our IR website and walk you through our typical modeling helpers. And I'll conclude my prepared remarks with my usual comments on cash, M&A and capital management. Okay, let's flip to Page 3 of the earnings release. Headline Brokerage segment third quarter organic growth of 6% without interest income. That's right in line with our September IR Day forecast during which we signaled about a point of headwind due to the timing of large life sales. Recall that these life products are interest rate sensitive. So, as we've been discussing, clients were waiting for lower interest rates. Well, the good news Pat mentioned happened over the last month or so. We are now seeing clients fund their policies. In fact, here in October, we have already caught up more than half of what had slipped from earlier quarters. So, the quarterly lumpiness that we have been highlighting throughout the year is starting to swing the other way here in October. And thus, we are currently seeing fourth quarter organic towards 8% and full year pushing 7.5%. As we start to budget for 2025, our early thinking is Brokerage segment full year organic growth might be in the 6% to 8% range. If so, that could mean a 2025 similar to how 2024 might ultimately play out. We'll provide some more on our 2025 thinking at our December IR Day. But an early read through is we remain upbeat on our ability to grow given the investments we have been making in the business from adding niche experts to rolling out new sales and support tools to expanding our data and analytics offerings. We believe these actions are leading to higher new business production and strong client retention across the globe. And as Pat described, the market environment is still a tailwind for us. Flipping now to Page 5 of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDA table. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 33.6%, up 137 basis points over last year and above the upper end of our September IR Day expectations. Let me walk you through a bridge from last year. First, if you pull out last year's 2023 earnings -- third quarter earnings release, you would see we reported back then adjusted EBITDA margin of 32.4%. But now using current period FX rates, that would have been 32.2%. Then organic and interest gave us nearly 150 basis points of expansion this quarter. Finally, the impact of M&A and divestitures used about 10 basis points of margin this quarter. You follow that and that will get you to third quarter 2024 margin of 33.6% and that's the 137 basis points of Brokerage margin expansion. That is really, really great work by the team. As we look ahead to fourth quarter 2024, we are still expecting margin expansion in the 90-basis-point to 100-basis-point range. And again, that would be off of fourth quarter 2023 adjusted margin for FX, which currently is estimated to be about 20 basis points lower than last year's headline margin of 31.6%. If we do that, that would mean full year 2024 could show about 70 basis points of margin expansion and 90 basis points excluding the first quarter impact from the roll in of the Buck merger. Okay. Let's move on to the Risk Management segment and the organic and EBITDA tables on Pages 5 and 6. It was another solid quarter. We posted organic of 6%. That's a point lower than our IR Day guidance because we just missed qualifying for a full revenue bonus related to one large account. That said, Gallagher Bassett continues to see excellent client retention and strong new business production and still delivers an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.8%, which is up 35 basis points over prior year and ahead of our IR Day expectation. Looking forward, we see organic of 7% and margins around 20.5% in the fourth quarter. If we were to post that, we would finish the year with organic pushing 9% and margins of approximately 20.5%. That too would be great work by the team. As for 2025, our early thinking is for organic growth similar to the Brokerage segment, call it in that 6% to 8% range. Turning now to Page 6 of the earnings release in the Corporate segment shortcut table. In total adjusted third quarter numbers for interest and banking, clean energy and acquisition costs came in within our September IR Day expectations. The corporate line of the Corporate segment was below our expectations due to approximately $9 million of additional unrealized non-cash foreign exchange re-measurement expense that developed during September and wasn't included in our IR Day forecast. After tax, call it about $0.03. That has already reversed here in October. So it really is a non-cash nothing in our opinion. But the accounting does cause some noise. Let's now move to the CFO commentary document. Starting on Page 3, modeling helpers. There's no new news here other than FX. So just consider these updated revenue and EPS impacts as you update your models. Turning to the Corporate segment on Page 4 of the CFO commentary document. No change to our outlook for fourth quarter. Flipping now to Page 5 to our tax credit carryforwards shows $796 million at September 30th. While this benefit won't show up in the P&L, it does benefit our cash flow for the next few years which helps us fund future M&A. Turning to Page 6, the investment income table. We are now embedding two 25-basis-point rate cuts in the fourth quarter of 2024 and have updated our estimates in this table for current FX rates. Punchline here is our fourth quarter estimate does not change much from what we provided at our September IR Day. Shifting down that page to the rollover revenue table, the third quarter 2024 column subtotal is $111 million and 141 million before divestitures. These are consistent with our September IR Day expectations. Looking forward, the pinkish columns to the right include estimated revenues for Brokerage M&A closed through yesterday. So just a reminder, you'll need to make a pick for future M&A. And when you move down on that page, you'll see the Risk Management segment rollover revenues for fourth quarter 2024 are expected to be approximately $15 million. So moving to cash capital management and M&A funding. Available cash on hand at September 30 was about $1.2 billion. Considering this balance and our strong expected free cash flow, we are in an excellent position to fund our robust pipeline of M&A opportunities here in 2024. We currently estimate capacity of around $3 billion for M&A here in 2024 and is looking like we could have another $4 billion to fund M&A in 2025, all while making solid -- maintaining a solid investment grade rating. So it's another excellent quarter in the books. Through the first nine months of the year for our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we have delivered revenues up 16%, organic growth of 8%, net earnings of up 20%, adjusted EBITDA up 18% and adjusted EPS up 17%. Those are terrific numbers and reflect an unstoppable culture. We are well on our way to another great year of financial results. Hats off to the team for all of their hard work. So back to you, Pat. There's definitely some price concern on casualty across the board. And I don't know if that'll filter into discipline on their part to continue to take it up more than we're presently seeing. But as you heard us earlier, umbrella is presently rising at about 10%. The only line in casualty that seems to have a difficult time finding bottom is D&O. The rest, however, are showing strength. I think it's going to be half new business in excess of lost business and I think that it's going to split the rest of it between exposure and rate. Yeah. I mean, our Australia and New Zealand operations killed it this quarter. So, they're up nicely. Canada's a little flattish. I mean, if you... ... want to do that, if you look at the U.K., there was a mixed issue there in the third quarter also that you could see through. But by and large, I wouldn't say that there's tatters anywhere that are causing us concern. Thanks. Yeah. We don't think we're going to be heavily impacted, maybe a couple million bucks from the storms. But that wouldn't move that. Maybe it moves at 10 basis points. Listen, if you want to pick the midpoint of that range, maybe benefits is around 5% and reinsurance is around 9%, something like that, when you're looking for a couple points on either side of the midpoint. Yeah. For next year. Yeah. I think we are going to be -- I think if you looked at a year-to-date in 2021, we were closing around 17 and 2022, we closed 19. Year-to-date 2024, we're at 27. Yeah, last year we closed 37 year-to-date with these tucked in deals acquisitions. So it was a little slower this quarter, but I think as you heard from Pat's pretty detailed comments, our pipeline is terrific right now. That's right. Yeah. That's a good point. We might be a little bipolar on that. We might have been able to schedule a couple extra pennies on that line for the reversal of what we saw at the end of the third quarter, but that bounces around quite a bit. So I think that we'll see what happens again. So we just didn't feel like for a couple pennies it was worth changing that number. Thanks. Yeah. No, I think it's just a good reminder. We have a lot of people listening to these calls, our own people included, and a lot of acquisitions, we try to maintain a good discipline around the pricing and we seem to strike a fair balance between that and the great people that join us. Yeah. I think... One of those acquisitions was not priced, what I would say, it was priced a little under market because we have some opportunity to help get better. Greg, I'm sorry. Go ahead. Yeah. I think you're seeing -- Greg, you're starting to see the flywheel just getting stronger and stronger as we benefit from scale, we benefit from technologies that we're deploying and we're benefiting from our offshore standards of excellence. It just gives us an opportunity to continue to optimize our workforce. And so, I think you're seeing that this quarter, yeah, popped up a little bit, because we have some opportunities to optimize our workforce. So, you'll see that from time-to-time. Yeah. I think you take the chaos out of the pricing cycle and have this rational pricing cycle that we're seeing right now. Our guys will show the tools and capabilities that we have, and that will shine through and differentiate ourselves. That's why when I said before that I see a better new business versus lost business year next year than we've even seen in the last couple of years. Well, listen, I think, I said earlier that, our first quarter is strong, because it's a heavy reinsurance quarter, right? We've talked about some of the life insurance being a little lumpy. But if you bounce those two things out of there a little bit, again, we're running around 7.5% organic growth each quarter. So while it looks like that on the face, yes, we're at 6% now, but we warned that there was a 4-point of headwind against that. Also, we're not seeing substantial rate differentials, rates between the quarters. So really underline it when you carve out the seasonality of a couple of our businesses, some of the mixed differences between when property renews versus when casually renews, the life lumpiness. You got to take our word for it. It's pretty steady underlying other than that those things that I've said. So it's pretty steady right now underlying. I have not. I will in December as we go through the budget. But I will say this, we post 6% to 8% organic growth next year. It's there, Mark. There's an opportunity for us to continue to get better. Our scale advantages are coming through our technologies, using the offshore centers of excellence. It still gives us an opportunity in an environment that we're seeing with current wage inflation, with current inflation and in other categories of our spend, that we continue to have opportunities to get better and better. And when you're punching out 6% to 8% organic growth, the underlying margins will absolutely have opportunity for expansion. Yeah. Listen, some of like our affinity businesses might be at 12%. Some of our program businesses might be around that 6%. I think our open brokerage is somewhere around 9% -- 8% or 9%. The reinsurance is somewhere around 8% or 9% this quarter. So I would say other than a couple, maybe the affinity business just a little better this quarter and maybe the program business just a little below that 8%. But the reason why we lumped them together and it was just to shorten the script, but there's not a lot of difference when you're looking at around 8%. Yeah. Always keep in the back of your mind our benefits business. That business is running around 5%. Take out the large life cases and stuff that bounce around a little bit. So as that -- as you think about those that are above that, 7% range. Yeah, you've listed them, but you also have to remember that the benefit businesses naturally runs down below that, that level. Some of our actuarial services businesses run a little bit lower than that. But as I look across the organic, across all the operating, we mentioned that Canada was about flat. But by and large, there's a few that offset each other. But it's not like there's any one particular area that is systemically running below that level right now. Listen, I think that there's no question the larger you are, probably the higher the multiple might be for somebody that's out there looking for an opportunity. But when we look at our tuck-in acquisitions, I think that people understand that we'll pay a fair price. And the advantage is they get to stick with us. They come in and they get to work inside of a broker. It's a broker selling to a broker. They understand that if they decide to take our stock, that they get to participate in equal form as you do, as I do, as Pat does, everybody else in this room. It's one stock for every person. They get our resources. They get to put their employees and their clients into an environment where actually joining us is going to deliver considerably more career value and more insurance value to their customers. So many times they look at it and they say that they get the opportunity to continue on doing what they're going to do and so they get excited about a 10, 11 or 12 multiple. That's the reality about it, is they're making a great return for their family. And they know they get to continue doing it with us for as long as they would like to do in their career and that's valuable to them, too. Don't forget that. Yeah. Listen, I think that when you're talking about that, it's another $7 million or $8 million of where it developed from. We just had, between our benefits business and our U.S. Retail business, that's where we picked up a few extra contingents in the quarter or our estimation for those contingents in the quarter. So there was nothing special in there. Again, we might give a couple million of that back next quarter because of the storms and floods, but by and large, it -- I would say around the possibility of what could have happened, it was a few million dollars in both of those businesses. Yeah. Listen, I'm just looking at my sheet here. If it moved, it moved a 0.5 point one way or another. We did have more. First quarter was just a little bit better than that, but second quarter is about the same number as what we've got right now. If it did, we're talking a few million bucks. I mean, I wouldn't call that as being a systemic issue that we're going to have to face. Just like with the storms, it's a few million. There are some corridors, that -- we do have caps in our contingents. And so sometimes, if there is -- if the carriers have, let's say, maybe loss -- more losses than they had hoped, it may still let us get to our full contingent level because there's caps on that. So, right now, we're not seeing a lot of pressure from that, not only in our past book, but as we look forward in the book. If carriers continue to strengthen their casualty rates the way they have been and what we're hearing from them, what we're reading about what they're saying, it should maintain our contingent level also. What I said is already here in October, we have recouped half of what had been the timing that had come out of this first quarter and second quarter, excuse me, second quarter and third quarter. So we're going to pick up. So far, it's half. We think that we've got a pipeline maybe to recover it all between now and the end of the year and then we'll start over again. Just like every other sales organization, we got to start over next year and go out there and see if we can gin up some opportunities. But this product is becoming more and more necessary for many not-for-profits in order for them to be competitive in their executive benefit package. So this is a product that we think has long legs over the next many years -- several or many years. Thanks, Grace. The lumpy business that we're talking about is about $125 million business."

            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2024 earnings call. On the call for you today is Doug Howell, our CFO, other members of the management team and heads of our operating divisions. Before I get to my comments about our financial results, I'd like to acknowledge the damage and devastation caused by the recent storms and floods. Our thoughts are with those impacted by these events, including our own Gallagher colleagues. Our professionals are hard at work helping clients sort through their coverages, file claims and ultimately get losses paid. I'm really honored to be part of a company in an industry with such an important responsibility, helping families, businesses, and communities rebuild and restore their lives and that's a noble cause. Okay, on to my comments regarding our financial performance. We had a great third quarter. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 13% growth in revenue, 6% organic growth, which does not include interest income. Reported net earnings margin of 15.5%, adjusted EBITDA margin of 31.9%, up 123 basis points year-over-year. GAAP earnings per share of $1.90 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.72, up 16% year-over-year. Another fantastic operating quarter by the team. Moving to results on a segment basis, starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 13%. Organic growth was right in line with our expectations at 6%, which, as we forecasted, reflects about a point of timing headwind from those large life cases we have highlighted over the past couple of quarters. Doug will provide you with some good news from October related to these sales in his remarks. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 137 basis points to 33.6%, which was better than our IR Day expectations. Let me give some insights behind our Brokerage segment organic. Within our PC retail operations, we delivered 5% in the U.S. and 7% outside the U.S. Internationally, Australia and New Zealand led the way with organic of more than 10%. The U.K. was up 6% and Canada was flattish. Our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of about 4%, and a few points higher, excluding the timing differences from the large life case sales. Shifting to our reinsurance wholesale and specialty businesses, overall organic of 8%. So very strong growth, whether retail, wholesale or reinsurance. Next, let me provide some thoughts on the PC insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Global third quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure were up 5% and little change from the 6% we discussed at our September IR Day update a few weeks ago. Most lines and geographies had very similar renewal premium changes through all three months of the quarter, with a couple of exceptions. September casualty renewal increases outside the U.S. were lower relative to July and August, driven by changes in business mix. Additionally, large account and E&S property renewal premium increases were a bit less in September than the first two months of the quarter. But neither of these appear to be a trend. Thus far in October, we're seeing large account property and international casualty renewal premium increases higher than September. Breaking down third quarter renewal premium changes by product line, we saw the following. Property up 4%, general liability up 6%, commercial auto up 7%, umbrella up 10%, workers comp up 2%, D&O down about 5%, cyber was flat and personal lines up 11%. So overall, increases continue to be broad-based and rational in our view, with carriers still cautious and pushing for rate where it's needed to generate an acceptable underwriting profit. We shine in this environment. Our job as brokers is to help clients find the best coverage while mitigating premium increases. So while not all the increases ultimately show up in our organic, a rational market allows us to further differentiate ourselves with our leading tools, data and expertise. Let me shift to the reinsurance market. The July 1st renewal season saw modest property price declines concentrated at the top end of reinsurance towers, while casualty renewals saw terms and conditions tighten, and some modest price increases concentrated in the U.S. Clearly, a lot has happened in the property market over the past month, which is now adding some complexity to January 1st property renewals. It's still early, but we now believe a flattish renewal is more likely than the downward pressure previously being discussed. And don't forget, U.S. hurricane season is not over for another month. For casualty risks, we believe reinsurance will remain cautious heading into next year, especially if there is more noise related to U.S. reserve adequacy. We think differentiating underwriting practices will likely be the key to a successful renewal for clients. Overall, the reinsurance industry remains adequately capitalized and is likely to meet capacity demands at the upcoming January 1 renewals. We continue to believe Gallagher Re will perform very well in 2025, regardless of how the market environment unfolds in the near-term. Moving to some comments on our customers' business activity. Our daily revenue indications from audits, endorsements and cancellations were again in positive territory for the third quarter. While the amount of upward revenue adjustments isn't as much as 2023, they're running in line with 2022. So client business activity remains solid and we are not seeing any signs of meaningful global economic slowdown. Within the U.S., the labor market is on solid footing. In fact, the number of open jobs increased in August and remained well above the number of unemployed people looking for work. Overall job growth, upward wage pressure and rising medical cost inflation continue to challenge employers looking for ways to grow their workforce and control their benefits costs. Regardless of market or economic conditions, I believe we are well positioned to take market share across our Brokerage business. Remember, about 90% of the time we are competing against the smaller local broker that cannot match our client value proposition, niche expertise, outstanding service and our extensive data and analytics offerings. Putting this all together, we continue to see full year 2024 Brokerage organic around 7.5% and that would be another outstanding year. Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Revenue growth was 12%, including organic of 6%. We continue to benefit from excellent client retention, increases in customer business activity, rising claim counts, and new business wins. Adjusted EBITDAC margin was 20.8%, 35 basis points higher than last year, and a bit above our September IR Day expectation. Looking ahead, we see organic in the fourth quarter around 7% and full year organic pushing 9%. Margins for fourth quarter and full year should be in the 20.5% range, and that, too, would be another outstanding year. Shifting to mergers and acquisitions. During the third quarter, we remain disciplined, completing four new mergers at fair prices representing $47 million of estimated annualized revenue. For those new partners joining us, I'd like to extend a very warm welcome to the Gallagher family of professionals. Looking ahead, we have more than 100 mergers in our pipeline, representing approximately $1.5 billion of annualized revenue. Of these 100 potential partners, we have about 60 turn sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $700 million of annualized revenue. Good firms always have a choice and it would be terrific if they chose to partner with Gallagher. Let me conclude with some comments regarding our culture. As we passed our 40th anniversary as a public company, I believe our greatest differentiator continues to be our bedrock culture. It's a culture that runs towards problems, not away from them. A culture that supports one another and embraces teamwork. A culture that is grounded in the highest standards of moral and ethical behavior. It's a culture that will continue to guide our success for many years to come. Frankly, we love this business. We enjoy taking care of our customers and that is the Gallagher way. Okay, I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thanks, Doug. And operator, if we could go to questions-and-answers, please. All right. So I think when you, renewal premium changes is what you're referring to as RPC, I'm assuming. We're not seeing underlying that our rates, that what we're seeing for rates are not different all that much in the third quarter at all compared to what we saw in the first two quarters. And I think you're seeing that in a lot of the carrier releases right now too. So rates for the fourth quarter, we're assuming about the same as what we're seeing here, yeah, in the third quarter, which is the same as in the first and the second. As for the increase next quarter, yes, we are getting about a point of additional organic growth from the life insurance sales. But when you bake all this in, we think that we're running around 7.5% in our business right now. That's the underlying growth. When you take out the puts and takes quarter-to-quarter, yeah, we're nicely in that 7% to 8% range. We are a little slower in the fourth quarter. It's not as big a quarter for reinsurance for us. And that has been an organic leader over the last couple of years. So, yes, we do have a little bit of that impact because we're not so heavily weighted in the fourth quarter to reinsurance. Well, I think, you have to look at our premium funding business there. So when you take a look at the table on Page 6 of the earnings release, I don't think we've changed our estimates all that much for the, excuse me, of the CFO commentary. I don't think we've changed our comments all that much for the fourth quarter. You also realize there can be some times where we have, obviously, fluctuations in our fiduciary cash balances, too, that can impact that number. Yeah. I just got one number here. Our U.S. business, our casualty lines are up a 4-point third quarter versus second quarter. Well, I think you're going to see strong international growth. That's where our strongest component is right now and that does not seem to be backing off. So, if you look at our prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that we're a good part of our growth this quarter was international considering finance. Yeah. International is up 10% this quarter. And Doug's comment's right. The lead by New Zealand and Australia. Well, I think if you take a look at -- this is Pat. If you take -- if you look at the general marketplace in terms of acquisitions, there's been a bit of a slowdown in general across the Board for the last year. We've got a great pipeline. In my experience, we've got one of the best pipelines we've ever had. So I think that possibly when the discomfort, if you want to call it that or concentration on this election finally ends, clearly if the Democrats get in, I think there could be a rush for the door. I don't know what happens in the case the Republicans win, but at any rate, I think when things settle out, we do think there'll be continued great opportunity and I do think that there'll be a return to a little bit more robust market. Thanks, Elyse. Hi, Greg. Yeah. When we prepared the remarks, Greg, we did discuss whether in the past we'd been undisciplined. What I said... I was just going to say, Greg, you hit on the offshoring thing is really continues to be a very strong play for us and you'll recall years ago, we started with a very small group. We're 12,500 people strong there now and as we do acquisitions and go across the Board, illustrating the type of quality and the speed with which we can do things like issue certificates, there's pretty quick adoption. It's pretty good. No. Really not flat, Greg, for two reasons. Exposure units, thankfully, are continuing to grow. This is why we go through our daily review of the things that are coming through audits, et cetera. We're seeing a robust economy and that's clearly in a big part of the middle market. And so, from SME all the way through large accounts, we've got the data on that. People are expanding their exposure units, so budgets are going up. Secondly, we're very, very cautious. We are not leading customers to believe that there's any kind of nirvana relative to rates. That is not what's happening. We show them our detail that we go over with you quarterly. Property is up 4%. General liability is up 6%. You may not deserve that. That may not hit your P&L. But on the other hand, you may deserve 25%. And this is a rational market and we've got to talk through that, which leads us right into discussing how much you retain, what you bring back into the coverage stack that you might not have had before. And that's where the real strength and art of being a broker is, is understanding that appetite for risk that each individual account has, working with those primary buyers to decide how they're going to get their best spend and it's not a discussion all around rate by any means. And by the way, to that point, Greg, we can take clients into our data now and I think you know this. We can say clients like you buy this and their quotes and cover looks like this. And by the way, their costs are this. Well, why is that? Think about selling or buying a house on the street. One's been taken care of, looks pretty darn good, has street appeal. The other looks like junk. Guess who gets the better price? Why don't we try to get you looking more like the house on the street people want to buy? And that, back to my point of art, is what it's all about to be a good broker and that's why when we get a rate environment like this, I feel very confident talking to our salespeople about we better see some increased sales, folks. Let's go. Thanks, Greg. Yeah. And if you want to go back three years or four years, D&O is up 300%. So by line, by geography, these rates do make a difference. They move. So we're not seeing a D&O renewal anywhere near 300%. In fact, it's off 5% or 6%. So the percentages do move. This is not an environment where you say for the next 10 years, good news is it's 4% a quarter, bing, bang, boom. I don't think it has any impact, to be perfectly blunt, on our business at all. Thanks, Dean. Yeah. I think it's very -- it's a really interesting one, Mark. I think we're seeing continued tremendous submission supply into our wholesaling operation RPS that has not slowed down, which is really interesting and we are not seeing accounts flowing back to the primary market in any great extent. So the excess and surplus market, which we know has gobbled up a big chunk of the P&C market over the last five years, 10 years, seems to be continuing its growth and it's maintaining its accounts. And I think that's, we've got people in RPS that bring more than just pricing to the deal. There's a lot of expertise there. There's a lot of layering and structuring that goes into some of these deals that your local retailer, ourselves included, quite honestly, 50% of our wholesale business goes to RPS. That's for a reason. So I think it's both professional capabilities, as well as market access, and that market is still growing nicely. Thanks, Mark. Yeah. I think demand seems very, very strong, which is good news for us. Also, I think our level of expertise in helping clients in a market environment where there is capacity and they can move around how they play in that capacity. It's a very strong demand for our consulting capabilities around reinsurance. What's the next move for the carriers that are our customers? So you have both. You've got demand. I think you have more utilization. There's strong growth at the primary level and all that flows up into the funnel for reinsurance. And as one of the top three players in that business, we have a lot of good prospects on the list. Sure. Thanks, Alex. Let's also take a look at the landscape. We don't talk about this, I think, enough because the big deals get big headlines and they are big platforms. We estimate there's 29,000 agents and brokers in America. Last year, business insurance -- last July, business insurance ranked the top 100 in the United States. Number 100 did $30 million in revenue. So there's 28,900 brokers in America. That's firms, not people, that are out there trading. And that's why we say 90% of the time, which continues to be consistent over the last decade, when we compete in the marketplace, we're competing with somebody smaller. And it's probably less than 10% of the time, really, that we're competing with Marsh and Aon, who are the only larger brokers in the world today. It's not that we don't compete. There's a robust market at the top end. When you think about that, we can use our funds, as Doug says, at lower multiples. We can have 100 of these opportunities in our pipeline. We can be pricing out 70 of them and possibly put on a $1 billion of revenue with people that want to join us, haven't joined somebody else, want to bring their culture and their people aboard a culture that fits and matches theirs. As Doug said, a Brokerage run by brokers. It doesn't get the press, but it seems like a pretty good strategy and a good use of our cash does. Yeah. You better evacuate, Katie. I really don't. Here's the thing. Every one of these is a very interesting story unto itself. You've heard me say, I think the longest time we spent talking to a client, talking to a prospect and getting to know each other was 20 years. Sometimes they happen in a quarter. Sometimes they take a couple of years. And but when we get to pricing and we get to putting together a letter of intent, we're getting serious. And that's a deal that's going to get decided in the next six months. I don't really have a stat on how many of those do close, how many don't. It's a full-on sales process. It's just like selling insurance, frankly. If you don't have a lot in the hopper, you're not going to close a lot. We feel very good about these 60. You can ask me this every quarter and I will try to give some color. Right now, we feel very good about the deals that we're proposing right now. I would think we'd have a good shot at an awful lot of those. Thanks, David. Thanks, Mike. I think that's it, Operator. Thank you again, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We had an excellent third quarter and we're well on our way to delivering another excellent year of financial performance. I'd like to thank our 55,000 colleagues around the globe for their hard work and dedication to our clients. We look forward to speaking with you again in person at our December Investor Meeting in New York City. Thank you very much for being with us this evening. We'll talk to you then."

Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2024 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, other members of the management team and the heads of our operating business divisions. We had an excellent second quarter. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments we posted 14% growth in revenue, 7.7% organic growth and 8.1% if you include interest income. We also completed 12 new mergers totaling $72 million of estimated annualized revenue. Reported net earnings margin expansion of 35 basis points, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 102 basis points to 31.4%. GAAP earnings per share of $1.70, up 15% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share of $2.68, up 19% year-over-year, another great quarter by the team and right in line with the expectations we provided at our June IR Day. Moving to results on a segment basis, starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 14%. Organic growth was 7.7% at the midpoint of guidance, and above 8% if you include interest income. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion was 98 basis points at the upper end of our June IR Day expectations. Let me give you some insights behind our Brokerage segment organic. And just to level set, the following figures do not include interest income. Within our PC retail operations, we delivered 6% in the U.S. and Canada, 7% in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of about 3%, that would have been 5% without the timing impact from some lumpy life case sales. Shifting to our reinsurance, wholesale and specialty businesses, overall organic of 12%. This includes Gallagher Re at 13%, UK specialty at 10% and U.S. wholesale at 11%, excellent growth, whether retail, wholesale or reinsurance. Next, let me provide some thoughts on the PC insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance marketplace. Global second quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure changes, were up about 5%. So no change from what we discussed four weeks ago at our June Investor meeting. Renewal premium increases continue to be broad-based, up across all of our major geographies and most product lines. For example, property was up 2% to 4%, general liability up 5% to 7%, umbrella and commercial auto up 8% to 10%, workers' comp up 1% to 3%, D&O down about 5%, cyber was flat and personal lines up over 10%. So many lines are still seeing strong increases. Moving to the reinsurance market and mid-year renewals. Property reinsurance renewals saw modest price declines concentrated at the top-end of reinsurance towers due to the increased capacity from both traditional reinsurers and the ILS market. Offsetting this was underlying exposure growth, combined with increased demand, resulting in flat year-over-year premium for reinsurers overall. U.S. Casualty renewals saw terms and conditions tightened and some modest price increases. Reinsurers continue to heavily scrutinize submissions given the industry's unfavorable prior year reserve development and reinsurers view of the current loss cost trends. In our view, insurance and reinsurance carriers continue to behave rationally. Raising rates the most where it is needed to generate an adequate underwriting profit by line, by industry and by geography. We continue to see this differentiation in our data between property and casualty lines. Carriers believe property maybe close to approaching price and exposure adequacy. And thus, we are seeing property renewal premium increases moderating, but mostly within large accounts. Underlying that accounts with premiums around $1 million or greater are seeing renewal premiums flattish year-over-year. Yet on the other hand, in the small and mid-sized client space, where we are an industry leader, we are seeing increases of 7% for the second quarter. Shifting to casualty classes, we are seeing the greatest renewal premium increases and signs of these increases advancing. In fact, global second quarter umbrella and commercial auto renewal premium increases are in the high-single digits, and there is little differentiation by client size. We have been highlighting worsening social inflation, medical expenses and growing historical reserve concerns for quite some time. And thus, we continue to believe further rate increases are to come in casualty. While renewal premium increases are rational carrier response in the current environment, our clients have experienced multiple years of increased costs. Having a trusted adviser like Gallagher can help businesses navigate a complex insurance market by finding the best coverage for our clients while mitigating price increases, and that's our job as brokers. Moving to comments on our customers' business activity. During the second quarter, our daily indications continue to show positive mid-year policy endorsements, audits and cancellations, similar with last year's levels across most geographies. So activity remains solid, and we are not seeing signs of global economic slowdown. Within the U.S., the labor market in balance remains intact with more open jobs than unemployed people looking for work. And with continued wage growth and further medical cost inflation, employers remain focused on attracting and retaining talent while controlling costs. So I see solid demand for our services and advice in 2024 and in 2025. Across the brokerage operations, I believe we continue to win market share due to our superior client value proposition, niche expertise, outstanding service and our extensive data and analytics offerings. Frankly, the smaller local brokers that we are competing against, about 90% of the time, just can't match the value we provide, and that is leading to more net brokerage wins for Gallagher. So when we pull all this together, we continue to see full-year 2024 brokerage organic in the 7% to 9% range, and that would be another outstanding year. Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Revenue growth was 13%, including organic of 7.7%. Adjusted EBITDAC margins were 20.6%, up 120 basis points versus last year, and in line with our June IR Day expectations. We continue to benefit from new business wins, outstanding retention, increases in customer business activity and higher new rising claims. Looking forward, we see organic in the next two quarters around 7% and margins around 20.5% that would bring full-year 2024 organic to 9% and margins to approximately 20.5%, and that, too, would be an outstanding year. Let me shift to mergers and acquisitions. We completed 12 new mergers during the second quarter, representing about $72 million of estimated annualized revenue. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Looking ahead, our pipeline remains very strong. We have around 60 term sheets being signed and prepared, representing around $550 million of annualized revenue. Good firms always have a choice, and we will be very excited if they choose to join Gallagher. Let me conclude with some comments regarding our bedrock culture. Last month, we reflected on the 40th anniversary of becoming a public company. Michael Bob Gallagher, Chairman and CEO at the time, knew above all, we must maintain our unique culture of teamwork, integrity and client service. Those values are captured in the 25 tenets with the Gallagher Way. Thanks to all of our global colleagues that live and breathe the Gallagher Way day in and day out. Our culture is stronger and more vibrant than ever, and it's our culture that continues to differentiate us as a firm and help to drive an average annual total shareholder return of more than 16% over the past 40 years. That is the Gallagher Way. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug?\nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll start with our earnings release. I'll comment on second quarter organic growth and margins by segment. Punchline is we came in right in line with our June IR Day commentary. I'll also update you on how we are seeing organic growth and margin shape up for the second half of the year. Then I'll shift to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our IR website, and I'll walk through the typical modeling helpers that we provide. And I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a few comments on cash, M&A and capital management. Okay. Let's flip to Page 3 of the earnings release. Headline Brokerage segment second quarter organic growth of 7.7%. Again, that's right in line with our June IR day, where we forecasted a range of 7.5% to 8%. Notably, we would have been above 8% if a few large live sales had not shifted from second quarter to later in the year. We signaled this possible timing to our June IR Day. So again, no new news here. Recall that we also foreshadowed in late June a small headwind from contingents that adversely impacted all inorganic by about 25 basis points. And finally, just a reminder, that we don't include interest income and organic. If we did, that would have pushed organic higher by about 40 basis points. We believe the investments that we have made in people, sales tools, niche experts and data and analytics are leading to strong new business production and favorable client retention across the globe. Additionally, the insurance market backdrop remains supportive of growth. Pat said renewal premium changes 5% in the quarter. However, our July's renewal premium change thus far is above second quarter. And with an active hurricane season predicted and noise around U.S. casualty reserves growing louder again this quarter, it's not unreasonable to expect mid single-digit or greater renewal premium changes in the second half of 2024. So our organic investments, combined with the insurance market conditions, continues to support our 2024 full-year Brokerage segment organic outlook. We are still seeing it in that 7% to 9% range. So now flip to Page 5 of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. Second quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was 33.1%, up 98 basis points over last year and at the upper end of our June IR Day expectations. Let me walk you through a bridge from last year. First, if you pull out last year 2023 second quarter, you'd see we reported back then adjusted EBITDAC margin of 32.1%. Second, you need to adjust for current period FX rates, which had a very limited impact on margin this quarter. So 2023 adjusted FX margin was also 32.1%. Third, organic and interest gave us nearly 110 basis points of margin expansion this quarter and then the impact of M&A and divestitures used about 10 basis points of margin. That gets you to second quarter 2024 margins of 33.1%, and therefore, that's nearly 100 basis points of brokerage margin expansion. That's really, really great work by the team. As we look ahead to the second half of 2024, we are still expecting margin expansion in the 90 basis points to 100 basis points range. So third and fourth quarter will look a lot like second quarter. Recall, first quarter 2024 still had the roll-in impact of the Buck acquisition. So the math for full-year 2024 will show about 60 basis points of full-year expansion, but that would be about 80 basis points full-year without Buck, which feels about right, assuming we posted organic in the 7% to 9% range. Let's move now to the Risk Management segment and the organic and EBITDAC tables on Pages 5 and 6 of the earnings release. Another excellent quarter. We saw solid new business, fantastic retention and growing claim count. We posted organic of 7.7% and margins at 20.6%, both were right in line with our June IR Day outlook. Looking forward, as Pat said, we see organic in each of the next two quarters around 7% and margins around 20.5%. If we were to post that, we would finish the year with organic of 9% and margins of approximately 20.5%. That also would be great work by the team. Turning to Page 6 of the earnings release and the corporate segment shortcut table. Adjusted second quarter numbers came in just better than the favorable end of our June IR Day expectations. All of that was due to some favorable tax items within the corporate expense line. All right. Now let's move to the CFO commentary document, starting on Page 3, a few comments. First, foreign exchange. The dollar has weakened over the past month, so please make sure you incorporate these updated revenue and EPS impacts from FX in your models for the Brokerage and Risk Management segment. Second, Brokerage segment amortization expense. Recall, while this impacts reported GAAP results, we adjusted out so it doesn't impact adjusted non-GAAP earnings. This line can also be a bit noisy from time to time. Late this quarter, we received updated third-party M&A valuation estimates on a third \u2013 or excuse me, on a few recent acquisitions and also made some balance sheet adjustments at the end of the quarter. You'll see that in Footnote two at the bottom of the page. Looking forward, we expect amortization expense of about $155 million per quarter. Again, all of that is adjusted out, but it does cause some noise in the reported GAAP results. Now it's the risk management amortization and depreciation line. Here too, we received updated M&A valuation estimates for our recent acquisition, which is also described in Footnote five. The net impact to non-GAAP results is about $0.01 to EPS this quarter. Going forward, we are now expecting a lower level of depreciation and amortization as a result of that M&A valuation report. Turning to the Corporate segment on Page 4, no change to our outlook for the third and fourth quarter. Flipping to Page 5 to our tax credit carryforwards. It shows about $800 million at June 30. While this benefit won't show up in the P&L, it does benefit our cash flow by about $150 million to $180 million a year, which helps us fund future M&A. Turning now to Page 6, the investment income table. We call this modeling help breaks down the components of investment income, premium finance revenues, book gains and equity investments in third-party brokers. And as a reminder, none of these items are included in our organic growth computations that we present on Pages 3 and 5 of our earnings release. The punchline here is not much has changed from what we provided at our June IR Day. We are still embedding two 25 basis point rate cuts in the second half of 2024, and we have updated our estimates in this table for current FX rates. When you ship down on that page to the rollover revenue table, second quarter 2024 column, the subtotal shows $128 million and $142 million before divestitures. The $142 million was better than our IR Day outlook due to a few acquisitions performing very well during June. Looking forward, the pinkish columns to the right include estimated revenues for M&A closed through yesterday. So just a reminder, you'll need to make a pick for future M&A. Moving down on that page, you'll see Risk Management segment rollover revenues have been updated for our early third quarter acquisition. For the next two quarters, we expect approximately $20 million and $15 million, respectively. Please make sure to reflect these additional revenues in your models. Moving now to cash, capital management and M&A funding. Available cash on hand at June 30 was approaching $700 million. When combined with our expected free cash flow in the second half of 2024, which is typically stronger than the first half, we are well positioned for our pipeline of M&A opportunities. In total, we continue to estimate we could have $3.5 billion to fund M&A opportunities during 2024 and another $4 billion in 2025, all while maintaining a solid investment-grade debt rating. And remember, if we don't spend it all, it opens the door for share repurchases as well. Okay. Another excellent quarter and fantastic first half of the year. Looking ahead, we see continued strong organic growth due to net new business wins, a large and growing M&A pipeline, and many opportunities for productivity improvements. Add that to a winning culture, and I too believe we are very well positioned to deliver another terrific year here in 2024. Thanks to all the hard work by the team, and back to you, Pat.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Doug. Operator, do you want to open it up for questions, please?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nElyse Greenspan: Hi, thanks. Good evening. My first question is on the wholesale organic growth. You guys said it came in at 11% in the quarter. I believe the IR Day guide was 7% to 9%, and I think that reflected the slowdown you expected in open brokerage, I think, on the property side. So what changed relative to that guidance, and how the results came in, in the quarter?\nDouglas Howell: Listen, we had a terrific finish to the end of June. Submissions were up 31% during June. There is a \u2013 clearly a continued use of wholesalers. We're not seeing really any significant shift back to the primary market and the submissions were up and so our guidance is up.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then you \u2013 at your IR Day, you also had said when we think about next year, that it feels a lot like 2024. I think the assumption right is perhaps something still within the range of 7% to 9% organic in brokerage. I'm assuming that still remains the case, if you could confirm that. It's obviously been a few weeks. And then if that's the case next year, if this year's margin expansion was 80 basis points without the Buck and M&A noise, would that be the rule of thumb in terms of margin expansion for next year if you're in the 7% to 9% organic growth range?\nDouglas Howell: Well, yes, let's reaffirm that we see next year, it could be very similar to this year. Let's see what happens with hurricane season, casualty rates, interest rates, the election. So there's some unknowns that are happening, but we still think that next year feels a lot like where this year will come in. When it comes to margin expansion, let us work on that a little bit during our budget season. We'll start that before our September IR Day. We should have a good idea in October. But there's nothing systemic out there that would cause us to believe that in a 7% to 9% organic environment, you could see margins up in that 75 basis point to 100 basis point range.\nElyse Greenspan: Okay. Thanks. And then my last one. You guys said \u2013 you said you have $3.5 billion to fund M&A this year. How much did you spend in the first half of the year? And given the pipeline that you guys see, does it feel like there might be some buyback this year? Or is it still kind of TBD?\nDouglas Howell: So I think we've spent around $700 million thus far this year. We have some commitments out there. Do I see us having some buybacks? Maybe. We do have the large earn-out payable that's due right after the first of the year also. That's generally \u2013 we don't include that in that number. We kind of anticipate that, but that \u2013 we'll see. I just got off the phone an hour ago with one of our M&A bird dogs here in the U.S., and he's really starting to feel upward pressure on opportunities for M&A. There are some that are sitting there thinking that we'll see what happens with the November election. If it goes Republican, there's a lot of proposals to drop the capital gains rate maybe down to 15%. So you might have people that try to push that into January. If the Democrats win, then there might be a push to get things sold before the end of the year. So we're sitting very similar to where we were before an election three and a half years ago and where we were seven and a half years ago. There is a lot of uncertainty on M&A flow that revolves around the presidential election. So I think we've got a great shot of using it all. And if not, we'll take a look at what happens on share repurchases.\nElyse Greenspan: Thank you.\nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Elyse.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Zaremski: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. I hope this question makes sense. But on the pricing environment, you always give good commentary on the renewal premium changes and you kind of give it overall and by product line. And so the RPC, right, has decelerated more recently to around 5%, how is that interchanging with your organic growth? Why is there a bigger delta now between your organic and RPC versus what we saw early this year and last year?\nDouglas Howell: All right. So a great thing and maybe we haven't talked about it directly for quite a few quarters, but you always have to think about the opt-in, opt-out of the buyers' behavior. When prices are going up, buyers opt out of coverages, which might mean they increase the deductible, lower a limit or just don't buy certain coverages. As prices start to moderate or slower amounts of increases, they tend to opt back in. They reduce their deductibles, they raised their limits and maybe they buy coverages and they said, we just couldn't afford before. So if you go all the way back into our investor materials, there is always a delta between rate and exposure and what our organic growth is. And so that's why in periods when you see property is up 12%, we're not growing our property lines by 12%. They're growing 7%, 8%, 9% that's actually our revenue. So you always have to remember the opt-in, opt-out impact. Then the other thing to do is you got the dynamic of large accounts versus mid-market and small accounts that can influence that. So we're giving you a feel of what's going on in the market, but the behavior of our actual customers can vary depending on \u2013 by rational buying behavior. Prices go down, I buy more. Prices go up, I buy less.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: As Doug said \u2013 let me hit on that as well, Mike. Let's not forget what our job is. So Doug hit right on it. When rate and exposure looks like it's up 12% and you say, well, how come you're not seeing that write in your renewal book? Our job is to mitigate that. And we start right with that promise like wait a minute, here's where we see the market coming. A good broker gets out in front of this with their clients' months. Here's what we see in the market, here is what's coming, what are we going to do about it? Let's take retentions up. Remember, you dropped to cover before now it's time to add it. So there's a lot of moving parts between those two numbers.\nMichael Zaremski: Got it. And obviously, it's great you guys disclosed it. And so I guess I just want to put a final point on it. So is it fair to say that you're doing a good job for your clients and on a year-over-year basis, it's putting out a little bit of, I guess, pressure on your organic year-over-year? And separately related rate [indiscernible] do clients have the same amount of flexibility as they do in other lines that would cause the RPC disconnect to continue?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes, definitely. Absolutely. Number one, yes, if you throw me the softball, we're doing a good job for our clients, the answer is going to be best in the business. And we think these numbers show that. And we think the growth numbers show it. Absolutely. And yes, you'll continue to see always some change between what's being reported as growth in units of exposure and premium rates based on what we do. And the tools in our toolbox are unbelievable. So do you want to look at a captive? Would you like to take your attention up? It's not just, do you buy insurance or don't. Let's start with the things that maybe are the last things you should insure and the first things you'll self-insure. There's a lot of that work going on with our people every single day. By the way, that appetite for risk is very individual. It's not prescriptive. You can't take a book, there's no AI that says, Oh, an auto dealer has this much appetite for risk based on the number of cars in a lot. It's not how it works. So that's where our profession comes in and dealing with those people, and then our advice is critical. It's not just, well, I'm pretty bold here. I think $1 million retention makes a lot of sense. Wait, wait, wait, we think it looks better this way. And that's what we get paid to do.\nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's helpful. And just lastly, pivoting to reinsurance. To the extent you have a view, one of the largest reinsurers today put out some data kind of showing that reinsurance demand. I mean you guys have done a great job not only taking market share, but kind of being able to keep your organic high because of that demand, increased like mid teens-ish this year. And if we kind of think about what's going on in personal lines, there's a lot of inflation. So just curious, would you expect kind of demand for reinsurance. I don't know if you think all the way into 2025 yet, but to remain at kind of pretty high levels relative to historical and relative to this year?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: It'll go up. Yes, I do for a lot of reasons. I think that you're going to see the opportunity to buy more at prices that look more reasonable. And there have been cutbacks in the purchase of certain. The other thing is that these nuclear verdicts are real, and people are seeing that and they're going, it doesn't cost us much to buy on the high-end, the top of the tower, it does downward there's a lot more activity. And I still want to be sitting here with some goofball jury comes up with a $1 billion award.\nMichael Zaremski: Got it. So coming as seaside too, maybe more demand. Okay. Thank you very much.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nGregory Peters: Hey, good afternoon everyone.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Hey, Greg.\nGregory Peters: I guess for my first question, during your Investor Day, you spoke about net new business wins and clearly, your results reflect that. I was wondering if you could give us some more color on how the quarter shaped up and how we should think about your net new business in the second quarter versus, say, the net new business wins in the second quarter last year or some additional metrics around that?\nDouglas Howell: Well, it'll take me a minute to dig it out, but I can tell you that June year-to-date, we've actually expanded the spread between new and lost by a full point. And I think that's probably the best way to look at it. The absolute numbers are kind of irrelevant. Our non-recurring is also coming back. Before some of the non-recurring revenues might have been putting just a slight drag on organic, but now they're actually being in line with just our recurring business. So you're seeing an expansion of our spread between new and lost. How do we see that going forward? Greg, it gets more and more complicated. I actually think our team will do a better job showing our wares and our capabilities in a more of a stable rate environment versus kind of some of the chaotic rate environment that we've been seeing over the last few years. We've developed \u2013 we spent so much money on resources in the last five years. Three of those were consumed with COVID. Two of those have been consumed with some chaotic market behavior. Put our guys on a field with kind of calm rate environment, a client that's not trying to just save their business and rebuilding it after COVID, I think you'd be amazed at the digital and data and analytics and expertise. And now bring our reinsurance folks into bear, stack them up with our wholesalers, I got to tell you, it is a compelling offer at the point of sale that I would think that would absolutely deliver better net new business, more new, less loss as our clients really see the capabilities that we have built over the last five years. Arguably, maybe we've spent $1 billion in capabilities over the last seven years, something like that. So that's going to come out at the point of sale and give us a little calm in the market, and I think you're going to see our new business continue to go up.\nGregory Peters: Excellent color. Thank you. One of the things you've also talked expansively about in the past is the offshore centers of excellence. And this kind of dovetails with the opportunities for margin expansion. Is it your sense for Arthur J. Gallagher that you sort of maximize those opportunities? Or do you see further potential to \u2013 for more opportunities in offshoring to help drive some margin improvement?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Well, this is Pat, Greg. Let me take the operational side of that, and I'll throw the ball to Doug for the numbers and any kind of discussion there. But everywhere I look, I see opportunity and unbelievable benefits from using our centers of excellence. We started off checking policies 20 years ago with 12 people. We now have 12,000 people supporting over 400 services in 100 countries. It is unbelievable the level of professionalism that they help us attain. And that is a differentiator at the point of sale. It's a differentiator when we're recruiting. It's a differentiator in everything we do, and I don't see any sense of that slowing down or not being something that continues to expand. It's not just about replacing heads by any means. It's about having the people that should be doing things, doing them and freeing up those that should be doing other things, giving them the time to do that, which I do think feeds into retention and new business. So I think the \u2013 our centers of excellence are a unique product offering back to Doug's point about all the things we've invested in I think they are a very beneficial add to our sales list of things we provide at Gallagher. And as we grow through acquisitions alone, everyone of those people join us and we immediately start plugging them into this resource, which is another one of the reasons they join us. So to me, it's a very differentiating thing that we do. I think our team there is absolutely spectacular, and I'll let Doug address the numbers.\nDouglas Howell: Yes. I think if you talk about the growth path of our offshore centers of excellence, I think remember they work only for us. They're an integral part of our team. There isn't that they or we they are us. If you look at some of our outlook, if we're going to be $20 billion of revenue, there'll be almost 30,000 folks there. So the growth path of our India and other area service centers will grow faster than the headcount in our other areas. But more importantly on this is we've been on this nearly 20-year journey now to standardize, make our operations consistent. It really is going to allow us to deploy AI into that environment. AI is terrific when you have consistency of information and repeatable behaviors and processes. And we have that, and we've spent nearly 20 years doing this. We have a jump, I believe, compared to most by almost a decade. And I think that some of the tests that we're using with AI now will make our folks there better, will make the different type of job for our folks in the centers better, it will make our sales folks better, our service folks better. And I can speak, and I've got 57% of my entire global finance, worldwide finance team operating out of there, and I can see it going to 80%. So it is going to be a service and sales differentiator for us because of the hard work we've put in for the last 15 years.\nGregory Peters: Thanks for the color. Just a point of clarification. And I probably should know this number, Doug, but I don't remember. On the capital management side, you said, well, listen, if we can't do the deals, you get through your earn-out, you might consider share repurchase. When was the last time you guys were active in share repurchase?\nDouglas Howell: Well, let's see, it probably was maybe in 2000, when was Brexit? 2007 or 2008 years ago, whatever Brexit was.\nGregory Peters: Okay. All right. No, no. Thanks for the answers.\nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Greg.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our next questions are from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Motemaden: Hey. Thanks. Good evening. I just had a question. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the July RPC acceleration that you mentioned, Doug, maybe just a little bit around the lines. Is it property moderation kind of pausing, or is a casualty acceleration? What's going on there?\nDouglas Howell: Well, actually, a little bit of both. We actually saw it in property. And actually, property is a pretty heavy quarter for us here in the second quarter. If you think it's about a third of our business, I think here in the second quarter, it might comprise 50% of our mix. So property in July. We did see a slight tick up. I'm talking a point or so. I'm not talking about is five or eight points. It's one point to two. Casualty rates are showing some, I wouldn't say acceleration. We used the word advancement in terms of where they are because \u2013 but they're steady. We'll see what happens with the \u2013 with pricing here in the second half of the year coming out of the carriers. So I would expect that to advance more. So not a jump up, but certainly, again, our dailies, they come out overnight. I looked at it last night, and we're seeing a tick up on both property and on casualty.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Thanks. And there was a line in the press release on the adjusted comp ratio that caught my eye, just where you noted savings related to headcount controls. That's the first time I've seen that in, I can't remember how long. I'm just wondering, is that a \u2013 I guess, is that to do with \u2013 something to do with the offshore centers or is this more of a concerted effort to show some margin expansion as we think about this year and into next year?\nDouglas Howell: I think that the answer is this. First of all, if you look at what we did during COVID, we actually took out quite a few folks, and we've been hiring back since then. Our business has grown into that. We haven't stopped hiring by any means, so it's not an indication of everything. I think the teams just are seeing of their workload models that we're probably okay staffed in the environment that we are right now. So I would read that into it, but nothing systemic, but just maybe that we've hired back into the capacity that we need in 2023.\nDavid Motemaden: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just sneaking one more in. Just on the contingent commission accruals that you guys had made the true-up to this quarter. I guess, we have seen a lot of noise this quarter on casualty reserves, particularly on the more recent years. I'm wondering how you feel about the potential for more of those reserve adjustments to come through and how that might impact the contingents?\nDouglas Howell: All right. First of all, on the supplementals, we've done pretty well year-to-date. Contingents, we did have some development that happened. We're probably not accruing as, I don't want to use the word bullish, but I will for the second. And as we were \u2013 as maybe we could. Casualty, we're cautious on it. Some of our programs and some of our binding operations, you got to be a little bit careful on performance-related compensation there. But I don't see a systemic shift in how we believe that our total compensation is going to happen. Maybe some bumps a little bit per quarter, but we're talking a couple of $3 million on a $130 million number year-to-date. So it's pretty small.\nDavid Motemaden: Yes. Understood. Fair. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. On the risk management business, maybe we've gotten used to the elevated growth for quite an extended period of time, the 7% in the next couple of quarters. Could you maybe just talk about the growth environment there relative to what it might have been in prior years? And what's your expectation? Is this a little bit of a lull? Or is this a good number?\nDouglas Howell: Right. So first of all, let's make sure you asked about the history is that I think in 2022, we posted about 12% annual organic growth, 2023, it was \u2013 excuse me, 2021 was \u2013 it was 12%, 2022 was about 13% and last year is pushing 16%. This year, if we get 9%, we did talk about a couple of very large wins that we had that incepted in mid-2023. What we're seeing in our book of business right now is actually reassuring, not that we need reassurance. This is a great near double-digit grower and has been for a very long time is we're starting to see more and more opportunities in that $2 million to $10 million type customer a year. If you look at the amount of new business sales that are happening relative to, let's say, five years ago, it's nearly doubled now. We're double the size, too, but the carriers are beginning to understand that we offer a highly customizable solution. Self-insureds are seeing that our outcomes are better. So I think that there's a market awakening that we \u2013 when we pay nearly $12 billion or $13 billion primarily workers' comp and general liability claims that would be one of the top five, six, seven tiers in the U.S. as measured by total claims paid. So the expertise customizable services is becoming more and more known in the industry. So we're getting many more trips to the plate. Maybe a couple of fewer home runs, but I think we're going to see a lot of doubles and triples out there. So I wouldn't call it a lull because we're in now 9% this year, but we did have two years of some pretty big wins in there.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: But we wrote all the big ones. That's not, but [indiscernible] is a lot more difficult, more lumpy than the stuff we're seeing now.\nDouglas Howell: Yes.\nMark Hughes: Yes. Understood. And then the any way to break out the \u2013 within the wholesale to open brokerage versus the MGA and binding?\nDouglas Howell: Yes. Listen, I think that right now, open brokerage is maybe in that 11% to 13% range. And I think that binding and programs might be in the low-mid-single digits, something like that.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Mark, what I'm \u2013 what I'm most impressed with and pleased with is the fact that you're seeing that open brokerage number keep moving in nice double digits. My experience with these types of markets, especially with property is that the first line you kind of see submission slow down, people sort of stay where they are. There is a \u2013 our submission count is up substantially for the quarter, for the month, for the year. We are not seeing business flow back to the primaries. So the I think change that we've seen that were excess and surplus is becoming much more of the norm and where people want to check out what a wholesaler can do, and then we earn that business, we're not losing it. So submission counts are up, retention rates are up, new business is up, and that's pretty exciting.\nMark Hughes: Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Cox: Hey, thanks. Yes. Just a question going back on the opt-in, opt-out dynamics. Just curious, does that flow through net new business and that's what's kind of driving the one point higher, you said June year-to-date of net new business? Or is that something else entirely?\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes, I think some of that flows back \u2013 well, so for instance, a good example of that is a lot of our public entity clients, and as you know, we're very, very sizable in the public entity sector. They just work off a budget. And if the primary premiums are rising, they're taking bigger retentions, they're dropping limits, and they don't \u2013 they're not necessarily comfortable with that. So when the opportunity to buy those back up comes up, and they had an extra layer, they expand their coverage, oftentimes, we will call that new business. And at the same time, we're facing the renewal reductions on the stuff that stays with us. But it is a factor of what's available and what their budget restraints are.\nDouglas Howell: Yes, I think it's a little tough for us. If they write a new cover and it goes through a different \u2013 if an existing client writes a new cover that goes through our wholesale business, that would be new business. If it's a change in premium level or like a slightly lower deductible or slightly low \u2013 higher retention, that would go as renewal change. It's a little tough sometimes to split that apart. But \u2013 so part of it goes to new business. Probably if I were going to guess, maybe 20%, 25% goes through new business and 75% would go through the renewal premium change.\nRobert Cox: Okay. Thanks for walking us through the nuances there. And then just on the revenue indications from the audit endorsements and cancellations, those are remaining positive. Just curious if the rate of change on those is either accelerating or is that decelerating at this point?\nDouglas Howell: All right. Great question. So on the surface, we're about the same as they were last year second quarter. But what happened last year's second quarter, we actually had quite a bit of endorsements that came out of the mini banking crisis. You were seeing a lot of banks increasing their D&Os in April of \u2013 March, April of 2023. We didn't have that repeat this year, probably a good thing we're not having that crisis. But interestingly, flat year-over-year, carve that out, that's still up pretty nice.\nRobert Cox: Got it. Thank you.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Mike Ward with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ward: Thanks guys. I was wondering if you could update us on the progress with your integrated approach where you're going to market with multiple businesses at a time? I think you talked about leveraging programs, reinsurance and Gallagher Bassett together?\nDouglas Howell: All right. So yes, there's some good program development going on that combines those three together. Then also, you're having the introductions that happen across the units. I think our introductions to our reinsurance folks coming out of our carrier relations folks to the carriers is working very well. We're seeing some nice wins on that. Getting our program folks integrally involved with the reinsurers to create the capital, find the fronting market, it's going very well, at least from the CFO's chair.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Yes. Mike, I think when we talked about that, we weren't talking about taking just individual accounts and saying the way we want to do this is all together now on the XYZ manufacturing company. What we're talking about is what Doug was hitting on. We're now meeting with insurance companies quite regularly, and we're saying, let's talk about the broad base of our relationship. And at that table are our reinsurance people, our benefits people, our service people on the claims side as well as the property casualty production and marketing folks. That is working extremely well for us, and that's really what Doug was talking about. Now at the same time, in RPS, looking across a broad base of programs. We are looking at those saying, okay, we've got about 250 programs in the company. Where are we not, a, doing the reinsurance, b, doing the claims and what should we be doing to make sure that our retailers are using those programs as well. So it's kind of a mixed bag, and it's not like we just take XYZ account to the market and say now it's all or nothing, or to the client and say it's all or nothing. I hope that color gives you a little bit of reference to what we were talking about the last time around as well.\nMichael Ward: Yes. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And then second question was just on the political election scenario type theme. Curious if you have any other kind of tax credit generation prospects in the pipeline, and any, I guess, political risk to those in the near term that we see?\nDouglas Howell: Well, most of our tax credits are already in the bank. So I think we feel pretty comfortable about that. What are we working on? I think that with 45Q that really was passed under the previous above \u2013 all above-the-line inflation reduction at, it's made the tax credit market much more common, much more defined, broader, but we're pretty well suited for tax credits for the next four to five years. I'm not \u2013 I don't think we need to plunge in to new tax credit projects right now because we just generate the credits and they sit on the shelf for four or five years. The team is working on it, and there are some exciting things that are happening out there across all forms of clean energy that are exciting. But I don't see us doing something big in the next 1.5 years. Let's burn through these credits first, and then we'll see about what we can do. And by that time, there'll be a robust market out there for tax credits. You can get insurance on it now that much more to ensure the credit. So that's a good change in the law. Right now, I think the law is pretty well suited for us to do something in a few years and probably not have to do it with a lot of capital investment into it either.\nMichael Ward: Okay. So maybe if I'm thinking about it right, that \u2013 this dynamic should help bolster you in terms of, I don't know, having extra leverage in the M&A scenario if rates are cut. That should help sort of bolster your competitive edge, I would think. And do you have like a sort of update on the PE interest in the market?\nDouglas Howell: Well, listen not to belabor the PE update. Like I said I just got off the phone with our bird dog. And I got to tell you, my soap box is that I had during the IR Day about the new, what I call less than transparent equity structures that PEs are now doing in order to buy nice family-owned brokers. I think there's starting to be more and more of \u2013 the curtain has been pulled back on that, and I think that sellers are really looking at. They don't have the same equity. At Gallagher, you got one equity, owners, employees, people that sell into the business and you on this call own the same equity across the board. That's not how it works now with the PE structures, and it all looks okay, do the models on it, looks okay, what happens if everything goes up in a linear line. Get a little bit of a down draft on that, and the people that give their family's lifetime of work to the PE firms get very little. And I'm telling you that is something that needs to be aware out there. And I think that when I talked at one of the bird dog today, he said, it's becoming more and more apparent to sellers they're getting the last spot of the trough.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Let me take another side of that too, Mike. Second quarter, I believe it was Marsh Perry put out a reporter Optus partners. There were 62 buyers of properties in the second quarter alone. There's a lot of private equity interest in our space. That's not stupid money. I do believe that the multiples have risen, that we've been paying for these properties because of that interest over the years. Having said that, I think the quarter was 20% down in actual transactions. So you've got maybe smarter money, maybe smaller amounts of money, but the transaction count is coming down. I think sellers, as Doug said, are getting a little bit more discerning. And I do think when you take a look at what's happened with some of the roll-ups who are now at a point where it's time to go public, and I won't mention any names, you know who they are, well, let's see how that goes. It isn't an easy slog, and I think sellers are seeing that as well. And by the way, it's pretty easy to join somebody that's going to change, nothing in your shop until they want to go public. Better, I think, as Doug said, and joined me that everybody from the family to you all as investors, you have the same stack. Now one other comment on this. When we do an acquisition, we give the opportunity for everybody in that acquisition from that point on to participate in this equity. We've got an employee stock purchase plan. We have an LTIP program for management and senior producers. We've got all kinds of ways for people to participate in our success and our growth. You sell to the PE people, the owners do great, PE investors hopefully do great, and that\u2019s it baby. Well, I like our model.\nMichael Ward: Awesome. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Grace Carter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nGrace Carter: Hi everyone. I wanted to start on the risk management guidance. I think you all mentioned maybe around 9% for the year. I think that the prior guide was maybe 9% to 11%. Could you go over maybe anything that's changed since we last spoke in June? Thanks.\nDouglas Howell: I think the degree of difference on a full-year on \u2013 listen, we're talking about a couple of million dollars on the difference between the 9% and 10%. So I wouldn't say that it's made $5 million. So there's nothing that's just \u2013 we think that we've got better insight for the rest of the year and so that range is coming maybe to the lower end of it than the upper end of it.\nGrace Carter: Thank you. And also on the brokerage organic growth guide, I think that you all had mentioned you are considering narrowing it maybe to 7.5% to 8.5% at the Investor Day. Just keeping it at a wider range of 7% to 9%, does that just reflect uncertainty in the environment? Or has anything changed since then? Or am I just reading too much into it entirely?\nDouglas Howell: Maybe the latter. I think it's been four weeks since we talked to you. We just finally got one more data point, and that's the close of June. So we'll talk to you again in September. And either way, listen, anywhere in that range. Look at that, that's 7% to 9% growth on top of 9% last year, 9% before. When you go back in 2019, we grew 6% all in. anywhere in that range is a terrific year. And if we can repeat it again next year, it's another terrific year.\nGrace Carter: Cool. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will be from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your questions.\nMeyer Shields: Thanks. Two quick ones, I think. First, I was hoping \u2013 hopefully, we won't need to know this, but give us a sense as to the contingent commissions exposure to hurricane season?\nDouglas Howell: No, it's very small.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: Very small. Most of that hurricane exposed business, especially in Florida, is in the excess and surplus, Meyer, we're the largest excess and surplus broker, I think, in the state. A lot of that is \u2013 all that\u2019s in the E&S markets and none of those are subject to contingents.\nMeyer Shields: Okay. Perfect. That is good news. Second question, just looking for a brief overview of your appetite for additional acquisitions in personal lines, I guess, both within high net worth and beyond that?\nDouglas Howell: Well, you're talking about personal line just being a pure auto writer, that's probably not what we're going to do. We're not great at it. We're an adviser. So if somebody is going to use us to use our advice to help them buy their insurance, that's the business of what we'd like to be in. High net worth on, we do a terrific job of it. I'm telling you our folks are some of the very best in the business, and that's an important spot right now. There's planes, there's boats, there's houses on sand bars, there's \u2013 how is on views that have landslide risk, high net worth needs an adviser probably as much as any complex mid-market commercial client. Just going on and trying to buy an auto writer, auto is probably not what we're looking to do. If it's going to be one of those things that it takes advice will be there in that space.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: We're actually very excited about the stuff there. I think that's \u2013 it's, a Doug said, a real opportunity for us.\nDouglas Howell: Well take your call, Meyer. Just go ahead, we'll help you out with it.\nMeyer Shields: I've got a ping pong table. That's about it.\nDouglas Howell: Well, there's a slip and fall on that one coming.\nJ. Patrick Gallagher: I think that's our last comment. So just our last question, let me make just a few comments on the way out here. Thank you, again, very much all of you for joining us. I know it's a little late, and thanks to all of our Gallagher colleagues around the world for their hard work and their dedication. These quarters don't just happen. Thanks to your efforts, that means our people we're in a really enviable position our net new business is up. Our M&A pipeline is growing. I'm proud of the year-to-date financial performance. And as you can tell, I'm bullish on 2024 and beyond. So 40 years, 16% TSR, compound average annual growth rate, pretty good 40 years. I'm looking forward to the next 40. Thanks for being with us.\nOperator: That does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Douglas Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll start with our earnings release. I'll comment on second quarter organic growth and margins by segment. Punchline is we came in right in line with our June IR Day commentary. I'll also update you on how we are seeing organic growth and margin shape up for the second half of the year. Then I'll shift to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our IR website, and I'll walk through the typical modeling helpers that we provide. And I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a few comments on cash, M&A and capital management. Okay. Let's flip to Page 3 of the earnings release. Headline Brokerage segment second quarter organic growth of 7.7%. Again, that's right in line with our June IR day, where we forecasted a range of 7.5% to 8%. Notably, we would have been above 8% if a few large live sales had not shifted from second quarter to later in the year. We signaled this possible timing to our June IR Day. So again, no new news here. Recall that we also foreshadowed in late June a small headwind from contingents that adversely impacted all inorganic by about 25 basis points. And finally, just a reminder, that we don't include interest income and organic. If we did, that would have pushed organic higher by about 40 basis points. We believe the investments that we have made in people, sales tools, niche experts and data and analytics are leading to strong new business production and favorable client retention across the globe. Additionally, the insurance market backdrop remains supportive of growth. Pat said renewal premium changes 5% in the quarter. However, our July's renewal premium change thus far is above second quarter. And with an active hurricane season predicted and noise around U.S. casualty reserves growing louder again this quarter, it's not unreasonable to expect mid single-digit or greater renewal premium changes in the second half of 2024. So our organic investments, combined with the insurance market conditions, continues to support our 2024 full-year Brokerage segment organic outlook. We are still seeing it in that 7% to 9% range. So now flip to Page 5 of the earnings release to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. Second quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was 33.1%, up 98 basis points over last year and at the upper end of our June IR Day expectations. Let me walk you through a bridge from last year. First, if you pull out last year 2023 second quarter, you'd see we reported back then adjusted EBITDAC margin of 32.1%. Second, you need to adjust for current period FX rates, which had a very limited impact on margin this quarter. So 2023 adjusted FX margin was also 32.1%. Third, organic and interest gave us nearly 110 basis points of margin expansion this quarter and then the impact of M&A and divestitures used about 10 basis points of margin. That gets you to second quarter 2024 margins of 33.1%, and therefore, that's nearly 100 basis points of brokerage margin expansion. That's really, really great work by the team. As we look ahead to the second half of 2024, we are still expecting margin expansion in the 90 basis points to 100 basis points range. So third and fourth quarter will look a lot like second quarter. Recall, first quarter 2024 still had the roll-in impact of the Buck acquisition. So the math for full-year 2024 will show about 60 basis points of full-year expansion, but that would be about 80 basis points full-year without Buck, which feels about right, assuming we posted organic in the 7% to 9% range. Let's move now to the Risk Management segment and the organic and EBITDAC tables on Pages 5 and 6 of the earnings release. Another excellent quarter. We saw solid new business, fantastic retention and growing claim count. We posted organic of 7.7% and margins at 20.6%, both were right in line with our June IR Day outlook. Looking forward, as Pat said, we see organic in each of the next two quarters around 7% and margins around 20.5%. If we were to post that, we would finish the year with organic of 9% and margins of approximately 20.5%. That also would be great work by the team. Turning to Page 6 of the earnings release and the corporate segment shortcut table. Adjusted second quarter numbers came in just better than the favorable end of our June IR Day expectations. All of that was due to some favorable tax items within the corporate expense line. All right. Now let's move to the CFO commentary document, starting on Page 3, a few comments. First, foreign exchange. The dollar has weakened over the past month, so please make sure you incorporate these updated revenue and EPS impacts from FX in your models for the Brokerage and Risk Management segment. Second, Brokerage segment amortization expense. Recall, while this impacts reported GAAP results, we adjusted out so it doesn't impact adjusted non-GAAP earnings. This line can also be a bit noisy from time to time. Late this quarter, we received updated third-party M&A valuation estimates on a third \u2013 or excuse me, on a few recent acquisitions and also made some balance sheet adjustments at the end of the quarter. You'll see that in Footnote two at the bottom of the page. Looking forward, we expect amortization expense of about $155 million per quarter. Again, all of that is adjusted out, but it does cause some noise in the reported GAAP results. Now it's the risk management amortization and depreciation line. Here too, we received updated M&A valuation estimates for our recent acquisition, which is also described in Footnote five. The net impact to non-GAAP results is about $0.01 to EPS this quarter. Going forward, we are now expecting a lower level of depreciation and amortization as a result of that M&A valuation report. Turning to the Corporate segment on Page 4, no change to our outlook for the third and fourth quarter. Flipping to Page 5 to our tax credit carryforwards. It shows about $800 million at June 30. While this benefit won't show up in the P&L, it does benefit our cash flow by about $150 million to $180 million a year, which helps us fund future M&A. Turning now to Page 6, the investment income table. We call this modeling help breaks down the components of investment income, premium finance revenues, book gains and equity investments in third-party brokers. And as a reminder, none of these items are included in our organic growth computations that we present on Pages 3 and 5 of our earnings release. The punchline here is not much has changed from what we provided at our June IR Day. We are still embedding two 25 basis point rate cuts in the second half of 2024, and we have updated our estimates in this table for current FX rates. When you ship down on that page to the rollover revenue table, second quarter 2024 column, the subtotal shows $128 million and $142 million before divestitures. The $142 million was better than our IR Day outlook due to a few acquisitions performing very well during June. Looking forward, the pinkish columns to the right include estimated revenues for M&A closed through yesterday. So just a reminder, you'll need to make a pick for future M&A. Moving down on that page, you'll see Risk Management segment rollover revenues have been updated for our early third quarter acquisition. For the next two quarters, we expect approximately $20 million and $15 million, respectively. Please make sure to reflect these additional revenues in your models. Moving now to cash, capital management and M&A funding. Available cash on hand at June 30 was approaching $700 million. When combined with our expected free cash flow in the second half of 2024, which is typically stronger than the first half, we are well positioned for our pipeline of M&A opportunities. In total, we continue to estimate we could have $3.5 billion to fund M&A opportunities during 2024 and another $4 billion in 2025, all while maintaining a solid investment-grade debt rating. And remember, if we don't spend it all, it opens the door for share repurchases as well. Okay. Another excellent quarter and fantastic first half of the year. Looking ahead, we see continued strong organic growth due to net new business wins, a large and growing M&A pipeline, and many opportunities for productivity improvements. Add that to a winning culture, and I too believe we are very well positioned to deliver another terrific year here in 2024. Thanks to all the hard work by the team, and back to you, Pat. Listen, we had a terrific finish to the end of June. Submissions were up 31% during June. There is a \u2013 clearly a continued use of wholesalers. We're not seeing really any significant shift back to the primary market and the submissions were up and so our guidance is up. Well, yes, let's reaffirm that we see next year, it could be very similar to this year. Let's see what happens with hurricane season, casualty rates, interest rates, the election. So there's some unknowns that are happening, but we still think that next year feels a lot like where this year will come in. When it comes to margin expansion, let us work on that a little bit during our budget season. We'll start that before our September IR Day. We should have a good idea in October. But there's nothing systemic out there that would cause us to believe that in a 7% to 9% organic environment, you could see margins up in that 75 basis point to 100 basis point range. So I think we've spent around $700 million thus far this year. We have some commitments out there. Do I see us having some buybacks? Maybe. We do have the large earn-out payable that's due right after the first of the year also. That's generally \u2013 we don't include that in that number. We kind of anticipate that, but that \u2013 we'll see. I just got off the phone an hour ago with one of our M&A bird dogs here in the U.S., and he's really starting to feel upward pressure on opportunities for M&A. There are some that are sitting there thinking that we'll see what happens with the November election. If it goes Republican, there's a lot of proposals to drop the capital gains rate maybe down to 15%. So you might have people that try to push that into January. If the Democrats win, then there might be a push to get things sold before the end of the year. So we're sitting very similar to where we were before an election three and a half years ago and where we were seven and a half years ago. There is a lot of uncertainty on M&A flow that revolves around the presidential election. So I think we've got a great shot of using it all. And if not, we'll take a look at what happens on share repurchases. Thanks, Elyse. All right. So a great thing and maybe we haven't talked about it directly for quite a few quarters, but you always have to think about the opt-in, opt-out of the buyers' behavior. When prices are going up, buyers opt out of coverages, which might mean they increase the deductible, lower a limit or just don't buy certain coverages. As prices start to moderate or slower amounts of increases, they tend to opt back in. They reduce their deductibles, they raised their limits and maybe they buy coverages and they said, we just couldn't afford before. So if you go all the way back into our investor materials, there is always a delta between rate and exposure and what our organic growth is. And so that's why in periods when you see property is up 12%, we're not growing our property lines by 12%. They're growing 7%, 8%, 9% that's actually our revenue. So you always have to remember the opt-in, opt-out impact. Then the other thing to do is you got the dynamic of large accounts versus mid-market and small accounts that can influence that. So we're giving you a feel of what's going on in the market, but the behavior of our actual customers can vary depending on \u2013 by rational buying behavior. Prices go down, I buy more. Prices go up, I buy less. Well, it'll take me a minute to dig it out, but I can tell you that June year-to-date, we've actually expanded the spread between new and lost by a full point. And I think that's probably the best way to look at it. The absolute numbers are kind of irrelevant. Our non-recurring is also coming back. Before some of the non-recurring revenues might have been putting just a slight drag on organic, but now they're actually being in line with just our recurring business. So you're seeing an expansion of our spread between new and lost. How do we see that going forward? Greg, it gets more and more complicated. I actually think our team will do a better job showing our wares and our capabilities in a more of a stable rate environment versus kind of some of the chaotic rate environment that we've been seeing over the last few years. We've developed \u2013 we spent so much money on resources in the last five years. Three of those were consumed with COVID. Two of those have been consumed with some chaotic market behavior. Put our guys on a field with kind of calm rate environment, a client that's not trying to just save their business and rebuilding it after COVID, I think you'd be amazed at the digital and data and analytics and expertise. And now bring our reinsurance folks into bear, stack them up with our wholesalers, I got to tell you, it is a compelling offer at the point of sale that I would think that would absolutely deliver better net new business, more new, less loss as our clients really see the capabilities that we have built over the last five years. Arguably, maybe we've spent $1 billion in capabilities over the last seven years, something like that. So that's going to come out at the point of sale and give us a little calm in the market, and I think you're going to see our new business continue to go up. Yes. I think if you talk about the growth path of our offshore centers of excellence, I think remember they work only for us. They're an integral part of our team. There isn't that they or we they are us. If you look at some of our outlook, if we're going to be $20 billion of revenue, there'll be almost 30,000 folks there. So the growth path of our India and other area service centers will grow faster than the headcount in our other areas. But more importantly on this is we've been on this nearly 20-year journey now to standardize, make our operations consistent. It really is going to allow us to deploy AI into that environment. AI is terrific when you have consistency of information and repeatable behaviors and processes. And we have that, and we've spent nearly 20 years doing this. We have a jump, I believe, compared to most by almost a decade. And I think that some of the tests that we're using with AI now will make our folks there better, will make the different type of job for our folks in the centers better, it will make our sales folks better, our service folks better. And I can speak, and I've got 57% of my entire global finance, worldwide finance team operating out of there, and I can see it going to 80%. So it is going to be a service and sales differentiator for us because of the hard work we've put in for the last 15 years. Well, let's see, it probably was maybe in 2000, when was Brexit? 2007 or 2008 years ago, whatever Brexit was. Thanks, Greg. Well, actually, a little bit of both. We actually saw it in property. And actually, property is a pretty heavy quarter for us here in the second quarter. If you think it's about a third of our business, I think here in the second quarter, it might comprise 50% of our mix. So property in July. We did see a slight tick up. I'm talking a point or so. I'm not talking about is five or eight points. It's one point to two. Casualty rates are showing some, I wouldn't say acceleration. We used the word advancement in terms of where they are because \u2013 but they're steady. We'll see what happens with the \u2013 with pricing here in the second half of the year coming out of the carriers. So I would expect that to advance more. So not a jump up, but certainly, again, our dailies, they come out overnight. I looked at it last night, and we're seeing a tick up on both property and on casualty. I think that the answer is this. First of all, if you look at what we did during COVID, we actually took out quite a few folks, and we've been hiring back since then. Our business has grown into that. We haven't stopped hiring by any means, so it's not an indication of everything. I think the teams just are seeing of their workload models that we're probably okay staffed in the environment that we are right now. So I would read that into it, but nothing systemic, but just maybe that we've hired back into the capacity that we need in 2023. All right. First of all, on the supplementals, we've done pretty well year-to-date. Contingents, we did have some development that happened. We're probably not accruing as, I don't want to use the word bullish, but I will for the second. And as we were \u2013 as maybe we could. Casualty, we're cautious on it. Some of our programs and some of our binding operations, you got to be a little bit careful on performance-related compensation there. But I don't see a systemic shift in how we believe that our total compensation is going to happen. Maybe some bumps a little bit per quarter, but we're talking a couple of $3 million on a $130 million number year-to-date. So it's pretty small. Right. So first of all, let's make sure you asked about the history is that I think in 2022, we posted about 12% annual organic growth, 2023, it was \u2013 excuse me, 2021 was \u2013 it was 12%, 2022 was about 13% and last year is pushing 16%. This year, if we get 9%, we did talk about a couple of very large wins that we had that incepted in mid-2023. What we're seeing in our book of business right now is actually reassuring, not that we need reassurance. This is a great near double-digit grower and has been for a very long time is we're starting to see more and more opportunities in that $2 million to $10 million type customer a year. If you look at the amount of new business sales that are happening relative to, let's say, five years ago, it's nearly doubled now. We're double the size, too, but the carriers are beginning to understand that we offer a highly customizable solution. Self-insureds are seeing that our outcomes are better. So I think that there's a market awakening that we \u2013 when we pay nearly $12 billion or $13 billion primarily workers' comp and general liability claims that would be one of the top five, six, seven tiers in the U.S. as measured by total claims paid. So the expertise customizable services is becoming more and more known in the industry. So we're getting many more trips to the plate. Maybe a couple of fewer home runs, but I think we're going to see a lot of doubles and triples out there. So I wouldn't call it a lull because we're in now 9% this year, but we did have two years of some pretty big wins in there. Yes. Yes. Listen, I think that right now, open brokerage is maybe in that 11% to 13% range. And I think that binding and programs might be in the low-mid-single digits, something like that. Yes, I think it's a little tough for us. If they write a new cover and it goes through a different \u2013 if an existing client writes a new cover that goes through our wholesale business, that would be new business. If it's a change in premium level or like a slightly lower deductible or slightly low \u2013 higher retention, that would go as renewal change. It's a little tough sometimes to split that apart. But \u2013 so part of it goes to new business. Probably if I were going to guess, maybe 20%, 25% goes through new business and 75% would go through the renewal premium change. All right. Great question. So on the surface, we're about the same as they were last year second quarter. But what happened last year's second quarter, we actually had quite a bit of endorsements that came out of the mini banking crisis. You were seeing a lot of banks increasing their D&Os in April of \u2013 March, April of 2023. We didn't have that repeat this year, probably a good thing we're not having that crisis. But interestingly, flat year-over-year, carve that out, that's still up pretty nice. All right. So yes, there's some good program development going on that combines those three together. Then also, you're having the introductions that happen across the units. I think our introductions to our reinsurance folks coming out of our carrier relations folks to the carriers is working very well. We're seeing some nice wins on that. Getting our program folks integrally involved with the reinsurers to create the capital, find the fronting market, it's going very well, at least from the CFO's chair. Well, most of our tax credits are already in the bank. So I think we feel pretty comfortable about that. What are we working on? I think that with 45Q that really was passed under the previous above \u2013 all above-the-line inflation reduction at, it's made the tax credit market much more common, much more defined, broader, but we're pretty well suited for tax credits for the next four to five years. I'm not \u2013 I don't think we need to plunge in to new tax credit projects right now because we just generate the credits and they sit on the shelf for four or five years. The team is working on it, and there are some exciting things that are happening out there across all forms of clean energy that are exciting. But I don't see us doing something big in the next 1.5 years. Let's burn through these credits first, and then we'll see about what we can do. And by that time, there'll be a robust market out there for tax credits. You can get insurance on it now that much more to ensure the credit. So that's a good change in the law. Right now, I think the law is pretty well suited for us to do something in a few years and probably not have to do it with a lot of capital investment into it either. Well, listen not to belabor the PE update. Like I said I just got off the phone with our bird dog. And I got to tell you, my soap box is that I had during the IR Day about the new, what I call less than transparent equity structures that PEs are now doing in order to buy nice family-owned brokers. I think there's starting to be more and more of \u2013 the curtain has been pulled back on that, and I think that sellers are really looking at. They don't have the same equity. At Gallagher, you got one equity, owners, employees, people that sell into the business and you on this call own the same equity across the board. That's not how it works now with the PE structures, and it all looks okay, do the models on it, looks okay, what happens if everything goes up in a linear line. Get a little bit of a down draft on that, and the people that give their family's lifetime of work to the PE firms get very little. And I'm telling you that is something that needs to be aware out there. And I think that when I talked at one of the bird dog today, he said, it's becoming more and more apparent to sellers they're getting the last spot of the trough. I think the degree of difference on a full-year on \u2013 listen, we're talking about a couple of million dollars on the difference between the 9% and 10%. So I wouldn't say that it's made $5 million. So there's nothing that's just \u2013 we think that we've got better insight for the rest of the year and so that range is coming maybe to the lower end of it than the upper end of it. Maybe the latter. I think it's been four weeks since we talked to you. We just finally got one more data point, and that's the close of June. So we'll talk to you again in September. And either way, listen, anywhere in that range. Look at that, that's 7% to 9% growth on top of 9% last year, 9% before. When you go back in 2019, we grew 6% all in. anywhere in that range is a terrific year. And if we can repeat it again next year, it's another terrific year. No, it's very small. Well, you're talking about personal line just being a pure auto writer, that's probably not what we're going to do. We're not great at it. We're an adviser. So if somebody is going to use us to use our advice to help them buy their insurance, that's the business of what we'd like to be in. High net worth on, we do a terrific job of it. I'm telling you our folks are some of the very best in the business, and that's an important spot right now. There's planes, there's boats, there's houses on sand bars, there's \u2013 how is on views that have landslide risk, high net worth needs an adviser probably as much as any complex mid-market commercial client. Just going on and trying to buy an auto writer, auto is probably not what we're looking to do. If it's going to be one of those things that it takes advice will be there in that space. Well take your call, Meyer. Just go ahead, we'll help you out with it. Well, there's a slip and fall on that one coming."

            "name": "J. Patrick Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2024 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO, other members of the management team and the heads of our operating business divisions. We had an excellent second quarter. For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments we posted 14% growth in revenue, 7.7% organic growth and 8.1% if you include interest income. We also completed 12 new mergers totaling $72 million of estimated annualized revenue. Reported net earnings margin expansion of 35 basis points, adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion of 102 basis points to 31.4%. GAAP earnings per share of $1.70, up 15% year-over-year, and adjusted earnings per share of $2.68, up 19% year-over-year, another great quarter by the team and right in line with the expectations we provided at our June IR Day. Moving to results on a segment basis, starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth was 14%. Organic growth was 7.7% at the midpoint of guidance, and above 8% if you include interest income. Adjusted EBITDAC margin expansion was 98 basis points at the upper end of our June IR Day expectations. Let me give you some insights behind our Brokerage segment organic. And just to level set, the following figures do not include interest income. Within our PC retail operations, we delivered 6% in the U.S. and Canada, 7% in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of about 3%, that would have been 5% without the timing impact from some lumpy life case sales. Shifting to our reinsurance, wholesale and specialty businesses, overall organic of 12%. This includes Gallagher Re at 13%, UK specialty at 10% and U.S. wholesale at 11%, excellent growth, whether retail, wholesale or reinsurance. Next, let me provide some thoughts on the PC insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance marketplace. Global second quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure changes, were up about 5%. So no change from what we discussed four weeks ago at our June Investor meeting. Renewal premium increases continue to be broad-based, up across all of our major geographies and most product lines. For example, property was up 2% to 4%, general liability up 5% to 7%, umbrella and commercial auto up 8% to 10%, workers' comp up 1% to 3%, D&O down about 5%, cyber was flat and personal lines up over 10%. So many lines are still seeing strong increases. Moving to the reinsurance market and mid-year renewals. Property reinsurance renewals saw modest price declines concentrated at the top-end of reinsurance towers due to the increased capacity from both traditional reinsurers and the ILS market. Offsetting this was underlying exposure growth, combined with increased demand, resulting in flat year-over-year premium for reinsurers overall. U.S. Casualty renewals saw terms and conditions tightened and some modest price increases. Reinsurers continue to heavily scrutinize submissions given the industry's unfavorable prior year reserve development and reinsurers view of the current loss cost trends. In our view, insurance and reinsurance carriers continue to behave rationally. Raising rates the most where it is needed to generate an adequate underwriting profit by line, by industry and by geography. We continue to see this differentiation in our data between property and casualty lines. Carriers believe property maybe close to approaching price and exposure adequacy. And thus, we are seeing property renewal premium increases moderating, but mostly within large accounts. Underlying that accounts with premiums around $1 million or greater are seeing renewal premiums flattish year-over-year. Yet on the other hand, in the small and mid-sized client space, where we are an industry leader, we are seeing increases of 7% for the second quarter. Shifting to casualty classes, we are seeing the greatest renewal premium increases and signs of these increases advancing. In fact, global second quarter umbrella and commercial auto renewal premium increases are in the high-single digits, and there is little differentiation by client size. We have been highlighting worsening social inflation, medical expenses and growing historical reserve concerns for quite some time. And thus, we continue to believe further rate increases are to come in casualty. While renewal premium increases are rational carrier response in the current environment, our clients have experienced multiple years of increased costs. Having a trusted adviser like Gallagher can help businesses navigate a complex insurance market by finding the best coverage for our clients while mitigating price increases, and that's our job as brokers. Moving to comments on our customers' business activity. During the second quarter, our daily indications continue to show positive mid-year policy endorsements, audits and cancellations, similar with last year's levels across most geographies. So activity remains solid, and we are not seeing signs of global economic slowdown. Within the U.S., the labor market in balance remains intact with more open jobs than unemployed people looking for work. And with continued wage growth and further medical cost inflation, employers remain focused on attracting and retaining talent while controlling costs. So I see solid demand for our services and advice in 2024 and in 2025. Across the brokerage operations, I believe we continue to win market share due to our superior client value proposition, niche expertise, outstanding service and our extensive data and analytics offerings. Frankly, the smaller local brokers that we are competing against, about 90% of the time, just can't match the value we provide, and that is leading to more net brokerage wins for Gallagher. So when we pull all this together, we continue to see full-year 2024 brokerage organic in the 7% to 9% range, and that would be another outstanding year. Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Revenue growth was 13%, including organic of 7.7%. Adjusted EBITDAC margins were 20.6%, up 120 basis points versus last year, and in line with our June IR Day expectations. We continue to benefit from new business wins, outstanding retention, increases in customer business activity and higher new rising claims. Looking forward, we see organic in the next two quarters around 7% and margins around 20.5% that would bring full-year 2024 organic to 9% and margins to approximately 20.5%, and that, too, would be an outstanding year. Let me shift to mergers and acquisitions. We completed 12 new mergers during the second quarter, representing about $72 million of estimated annualized revenue. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us, and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. Looking ahead, our pipeline remains very strong. We have around 60 term sheets being signed and prepared, representing around $550 million of annualized revenue. Good firms always have a choice, and we will be very excited if they choose to join Gallagher. Let me conclude with some comments regarding our bedrock culture. Last month, we reflected on the 40th anniversary of becoming a public company. Michael Bob Gallagher, Chairman and CEO at the time, knew above all, we must maintain our unique culture of teamwork, integrity and client service. Those values are captured in the 25 tenets with the Gallagher Way. Thanks to all of our global colleagues that live and breathe the Gallagher Way day in and day out. Our culture is stronger and more vibrant than ever, and it's our culture that continues to differentiate us as a firm and help to drive an average annual total shareholder return of more than 16% over the past 40 years. That is the Gallagher Way. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thanks, Doug. Operator, do you want to open it up for questions, please? As Doug said \u2013 let me hit on that as well, Mike. Let's not forget what our job is. So Doug hit right on it. When rate and exposure looks like it's up 12% and you say, well, how come you're not seeing that write in your renewal book? Our job is to mitigate that. And we start right with that promise like wait a minute, here's where we see the market coming. A good broker gets out in front of this with their clients' months. Here's what we see in the market, here is what's coming, what are we going to do about it? Let's take retentions up. Remember, you dropped to cover before now it's time to add it. So there's a lot of moving parts between those two numbers. Yes, definitely. Absolutely. Number one, yes, if you throw me the softball, we're doing a good job for our clients, the answer is going to be best in the business. And we think these numbers show that. And we think the growth numbers show it. Absolutely. And yes, you'll continue to see always some change between what's being reported as growth in units of exposure and premium rates based on what we do. And the tools in our toolbox are unbelievable. So do you want to look at a captive? Would you like to take your attention up? It's not just, do you buy insurance or don't. Let's start with the things that maybe are the last things you should insure and the first things you'll self-insure. There's a lot of that work going on with our people every single day. By the way, that appetite for risk is very individual. It's not prescriptive. You can't take a book, there's no AI that says, Oh, an auto dealer has this much appetite for risk based on the number of cars in a lot. It's not how it works. So that's where our profession comes in and dealing with those people, and then our advice is critical. It's not just, well, I'm pretty bold here. I think $1 million retention makes a lot of sense. Wait, wait, wait, we think it looks better this way. And that's what we get paid to do. It'll go up. Yes, I do for a lot of reasons. I think that you're going to see the opportunity to buy more at prices that look more reasonable. And there have been cutbacks in the purchase of certain. The other thing is that these nuclear verdicts are real, and people are seeing that and they're going, it doesn't cost us much to buy on the high-end, the top of the tower, it does downward there's a lot more activity. And I still want to be sitting here with some goofball jury comes up with a $1 billion award. Thanks, Mike. Hey, Greg. Well, this is Pat, Greg. Let me take the operational side of that, and I'll throw the ball to Doug for the numbers and any kind of discussion there. But everywhere I look, I see opportunity and unbelievable benefits from using our centers of excellence. We started off checking policies 20 years ago with 12 people. We now have 12,000 people supporting over 400 services in 100 countries. It is unbelievable the level of professionalism that they help us attain. And that is a differentiator at the point of sale. It's a differentiator when we're recruiting. It's a differentiator in everything we do, and I don't see any sense of that slowing down or not being something that continues to expand. It's not just about replacing heads by any means. It's about having the people that should be doing things, doing them and freeing up those that should be doing other things, giving them the time to do that, which I do think feeds into retention and new business. So I think the \u2013 our centers of excellence are a unique product offering back to Doug's point about all the things we've invested in I think they are a very beneficial add to our sales list of things we provide at Gallagher. And as we grow through acquisitions alone, everyone of those people join us and we immediately start plugging them into this resource, which is another one of the reasons they join us. So to me, it's a very differentiating thing that we do. I think our team there is absolutely spectacular, and I'll let Doug address the numbers. Thanks, Greg. Thanks, David. But we wrote all the big ones. That's not, but [indiscernible] is a lot more difficult, more lumpy than the stuff we're seeing now. Mark, what I'm \u2013 what I'm most impressed with and pleased with is the fact that you're seeing that open brokerage number keep moving in nice double digits. My experience with these types of markets, especially with property is that the first line you kind of see submission slow down, people sort of stay where they are. There is a \u2013 our submission count is up substantially for the quarter, for the month, for the year. We are not seeing business flow back to the primaries. So the I think change that we've seen that were excess and surplus is becoming much more of the norm and where people want to check out what a wholesaler can do, and then we earn that business, we're not losing it. So submission counts are up, retention rates are up, new business is up, and that's pretty exciting. Thanks, Mark. Yes, I think some of that flows back \u2013 well, so for instance, a good example of that is a lot of our public entity clients, and as you know, we're very, very sizable in the public entity sector. They just work off a budget. And if the primary premiums are rising, they're taking bigger retentions, they're dropping limits, and they don't \u2013 they're not necessarily comfortable with that. So when the opportunity to buy those back up comes up, and they had an extra layer, they expand their coverage, oftentimes, we will call that new business. And at the same time, we're facing the renewal reductions on the stuff that stays with us. But it is a factor of what's available and what their budget restraints are. Thanks, Rob. Yes. Mike, I think when we talked about that, we weren't talking about taking just individual accounts and saying the way we want to do this is all together now on the XYZ manufacturing company. What we're talking about is what Doug was hitting on. We're now meeting with insurance companies quite regularly, and we're saying, let's talk about the broad base of our relationship. And at that table are our reinsurance people, our benefits people, our service people on the claims side as well as the property casualty production and marketing folks. That is working extremely well for us, and that's really what Doug was talking about. Now at the same time, in RPS, looking across a broad base of programs. We are looking at those saying, okay, we've got about 250 programs in the company. Where are we not, a, doing the reinsurance, b, doing the claims and what should we be doing to make sure that our retailers are using those programs as well. So it's kind of a mixed bag, and it's not like we just take XYZ account to the market and say now it's all or nothing, or to the client and say it's all or nothing. I hope that color gives you a little bit of reference to what we were talking about the last time around as well. Let me take another side of that too, Mike. Second quarter, I believe it was Marsh Perry put out a reporter Optus partners. There were 62 buyers of properties in the second quarter alone. There's a lot of private equity interest in our space. That's not stupid money. I do believe that the multiples have risen, that we've been paying for these properties because of that interest over the years. Having said that, I think the quarter was 20% down in actual transactions. So you've got maybe smarter money, maybe smaller amounts of money, but the transaction count is coming down. I think sellers, as Doug said, are getting a little bit more discerning. And I do think when you take a look at what's happened with some of the roll-ups who are now at a point where it's time to go public, and I won't mention any names, you know who they are, well, let's see how that goes. It isn't an easy slog, and I think sellers are seeing that as well. And by the way, it's pretty easy to join somebody that's going to change, nothing in your shop until they want to go public. Better, I think, as Doug said, and joined me that everybody from the family to you all as investors, you have the same stack. Now one other comment on this. When we do an acquisition, we give the opportunity for everybody in that acquisition from that point on to participate in this equity. We've got an employee stock purchase plan. We have an LTIP program for management and senior producers. We've got all kinds of ways for people to participate in our success and our growth. You sell to the PE people, the owners do great, PE investors hopefully do great, and that's it baby. Well, I like our model. Very small. Most of that hurricane exposed business, especially in Florida, is in the excess and surplus, Meyer, we're the largest excess and surplus broker, I think, in the state. A lot of that is \u2013 all that's in the E&S markets and none of those are subject to contingents. We're actually very excited about the stuff there. I think that's \u2013 it's, a Doug said, a real opportunity for us. I think that's our last comment. So just our last question, let me make just a few comments on the way out here. Thank you, again, very much all of you for joining us. I know it's a little late, and thanks to all of our Gallagher colleagues around the world for their hard work and their dedication. These quarters don't just happen. Thanks to your efforts, that means our people we're in a really enviable position our net new business is up. Our M&A pipeline is growing. I'm proud of the year-to-date financial performance. And as you can tell, I'm bullish on 2024 and beyond. So 40 years, 16% TSR, compound average annual growth rate, pretty good 40 years. I'm looking forward to the next 40. Thanks for being with us."

It is now my pleasure to introduce J. Patrick Gallagher, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Mr. Gallagher, you may begin. \nJ. Gallagher: Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter '24 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO; and other members of the management team and the heads of our operating divisions. We had a great first quarter to begin 2024. \n For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 20% growth in revenue, our 13th straight quarter of double-digit growth, 9.4% organic; Virgin acquisition rollover revenues of approximately $250 million. We also completed 12 mergers totaling nearly $70 million of estimated annualized revenue. Reported net earnings margin of 21.5%, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 37.8%, GAAP earnings per share of $3.10 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.83, up 17% year-over-year. So another terrific quarter by the team. \n Moving to results on a segment basis, starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth of 21%. Organic growth was 8.9% and about 10% if you include interest income. Adjusted EBITDAC was up 18% year-over-year. And we posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 39.9% a bit better than our March IR Day expectations. \n Let me give some insights behind our Brokerage segment organic, and just to level set, the following figures do not include interest income. Our global retail brokerage operations posted 7% organic. Within our P/C operations, we delivered 7% in the United States, 6% in the U.K., 2% in Canada and 8% in Australia and New Zealand. And our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of about 8%, including some large live case sales that were completed in late March.\n Shifting to our reinsurance wholesale and specialty businesses, overall organic of 13%. This includes Gallagher Re at 13%, U.K. specialty at 10% and U.S. wholesale at 13%. Fantastic growth, whether retail, wholesale or reinsurance. \n Next, let me provide some thoughts on the PC insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Global first quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure changes, were up about 7%. Renewal premium increases continue to be broad-based, up across all of our major geographies and most product lines. \n For example, property was up nearly 10%; umbrella, up 9%; general liability, up 7%; workers' comp, up 2%; package, up 8%; and personal lines, up 13%. So many lines are seeing sizable increases. There are 2 exceptions within professional lines. First, D&O, where renewal premiums are down about 5%; and second, cyber, where renewal premiums are flattish. \n These 2 lines appear close to reaching a pricing bottom, but combined, represent around 5% of our P/C business globally. So overall, our clients continue to see insurance costs increase, but our job as brokers is to mitigate these increases and deliver comprehensive insurance programs that align with their risk appetite and fit their budget.  \n Moving to the reinsurance market. First quarter dynamics were dominated by the January 1 renewal season where we saw stable pricing and increased demand for property cat cover. Reinsurers continue to exercise discipline and met the increased client demand with sufficient capacity. Importantly, the team was able to secure many new business wins while retaining most of our existing clients. \n During April renewals, reinsurance carriers maintain their discipline, and with increased demand and stable pricing, we saw more coverage being purchased. Within property, more capacity was available at the top end of programs and the quoting of renewal process was disciplined and predictable. \n The casualty treaty market saw stable pricing overall. However, carriers able to differentiate themselves through good management of prior year reserves were able to secure better reinsurance placements. Specialty class renewals were a bit more complex with some changes in terms and conditions. However, many clients were able to secure modestly lower pricing. \n With that said, the tragedy in Baltimore may cause reinsurance carriers more pricing [ resolve ] throughout the rest of the year. Those interested in more detailed commentary on January or April renewals can find our first new market reports on our website.  \n In our view, insurance and reinsurance carriers continue to behave rationally. Carriers know where they need rate by line, by industry and by geography. We are seeing this differentiation in our data. Premiums are increasing the most, where it's needed to generate an acceptable underwriting profit. Great example of this is primary casualty, where we are seeing renewal premiums moving higher.  \n Global first quarter umbrella and general liability renewal premium increases are in the high single digits, including 9% increases in U.S. retail. A. M. Best recently maintained its negative outlook on the U.S. general liability insurance market due to worsening social inflation, medical expenses and litigation financing. We've been highlighting these dynamics for a while, along with hearing concerns around historical reserves, which leads us to believe further rate increases are to come in casualty.\n At the other end of the spectrum, we have property. As insurance and reinsurance carriers believe they are getting closer to price and exposure adequacy, we are seeing property renewal premium increases moderating. With that said, first quarter insurance renewal premiums were still pushing double digits. As we look out for the remainder of the year, increased frequency or severity of catastrophes could again move the market in '24.\n And while capacity was very challenging to come by during '22 and '23, we are now finding, when clients are looking to add coverage or limits, carriers are more than willing to provide additional cover. Notably, we are not seeing a change in the underwriting standards from our carrier partners. \n While continued premium increases seem rational to our carrier partners, our clients have experienced multiple years of increased costs, having a trusted adviser like Gallagher to help businesses navigating a complex insurance market by finding the best coverage for our clients while mitigating price increases. That's what we do.  \n Moving to our customers' business activity. Overall, it continues to be solid. During the first quarter, our daily indication showed positive midyear policy endorsements and audits ahead of last year's levels across most geographies. So we are not seeing signs of a broad global economic slowdown.  \n Within the U.S., the labor market remains tight. Nonfarm payrolls continue to increase and more people are reentering the workforce. Yet there continues to be nearly 9 million job openings. Wage increases have persisted at the same time, medical cost trends are rising. With these dynamics, employers are focused on total rewards strategy to help them achieve their human capital goals while reining in costs. That's why I believe our benefits businesses will have a terrific opportunities in '24.  \n Overall, we continue to win new brokerage clients while retaining our existing customers. In fact, our new business production has been on an upward trend in recent quarters, and our retention is holding. We believe this is a direct reflection of our client value proposition, CORE360 and Gallagher Better Works, our niche expert service and our data and analytics.  \n Don't forget, we're competing with someone smaller than us, 90% of the time. These local brokers just can't match the value we provide. So putting it all together, we continue to see full year '24 brokerage organic in the 7% to 9% range, and that would be another outstanding year.  \n Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Revenue growth was 19%, including organic of 13.3% and rollover revenues of $14 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margins were 20.6%, up 140 basis points versus last year and a bit better than our March IR Day expectations. Our results continue to reflect solid new business, outstanding retention, continued increases in new arising claims across both workers' comp and liability and resilient customer business activity.  \n Looking forward, we continue to see '24 full year organic in the 9% to 11% range as our larger '23 new business wins have been fully onboarded. We now expect full year margin of approximately 20.5%. That would also be another outstanding year.  \n Shifting to mergers and acquisitions. We had an active first quarter completing 12 new mergers, representing about $70 million of estimated annualized revenue. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. \n Looking ahead, our pipeline remains strong. We have around 50 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $350 million of annualized revenue. Good firms always have a choice, and we'll be very excited if they choose to join Gallagher.  \n Let me conclude with some comments regarding our bedrock culture. It's a culture that has remained constant through the decades of incredible growth. This is largely due to the 25 tenants of The Gallagher Way, which is entering its fifth decade next month. It is deeply rooted in the values of integrity, ethics and trust, which have been guiding us since 1927.\n Our culture is not just a differentiator, it's a competitive advantage. It attracts the right talent to our organization and the best merger partners and enables us to build enduring relationships. What makes me particularly proud is that I witness our culture in action every day as our employees demonstrate their commitment to our clients, and that is The Gallagher Way. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? \nDouglas Howell: Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our earnings release. I'll comment on first quarter organic growth and margins by segment, including how we are seeing full year organic growth and margins in each of the next 3 quarters. Then I'll provide some typical comments on the modeling helpers we provide in the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website, and I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a few comments on cash, M&A and capital management.  \n Okay. Let's look to Page 2 of the earnings release. Headline, first quarter brokerage organic growth of 8.9%. That's a bit better than our March IR Day expectation of 8% to 8.5%. And remember, we exclude interest income. Including such, we would have shown about 10% organic growth. Looking ahead, we continue to see strong new business production and favorable client retention.  \n Combine that with further rate increases, a resilient economic backdrop and sticky inflation, our 2024 brokerage organic outlook is unchanged. We are still seeing full year organic growth in that 7% to 9% range. \n Moving to Page 4 of the earnings release, to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. First quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was 39.9%, a bit better than our March IR Day expectations. The footnote on that page explains what we discussed in our January earnings call and again at our March IR Day. There is 90 basis points of roll-in impact from M&A, principally Buck, that naturally runs lower margins.  \n So on the surface, it is showing 30 basis points lower, but underlying margins actually expanded 60 basis points. Again, that improvement is a little better than what we forecasted in March. Let me walk you through a bridge from last year. First, if you were to pull out last year's 2023 first quarter, you would see we reported, back then, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 40.4%.\n Second, when we update that margin using current period FX rate, gets you to an FX adjusted margin of about 40.2%. And we've done that here. So you can see that in the 2023 column in this table. Third, deduct that the 90 basis point roll-in impact. Again, that's all due to the roll-in math. And let's -- just to be clear, these are not businesses with margins that are going backwards. \n So that gets you to 39.3%, Compare that to the 39.9% we show today, and that gives you the underlying 60 basis points of margin expansion. That is really great work by the team.  As we look ahead to the following 3 quarters of '24, it is looking like we could expand margins in the 90 to 100 basis point range in each of the next 3 quarters. Let me give you some flavor on that. \n First, as Pat said, Buck passed its 1-year anniversary, so that roll-in noise is behind us. Second, as discussed at our March IR Day, the carryover impact of raises given in 2023 is comparatively lesser over the next 3 quarters. And third, the reality is we are typically posting margins higher than most of our M&A targets. \n While that slightly impacts what we report as margin expansion, we will do these mergers all day, any day. These are great businesses with terrific talent. And when we combine, we are better together. So to repeat, expansion in 90 to 100 basis points range in each of the next 3 quarters would get you to about 60 basis points of full year margin expansion. That assumes we would post organic in that 7% to 9% range and it still is allowing us to continue to make substantial investments in data analytics, sales tools, digital service and arming our sales and service folks with the best resources in the business.  \n Okay. Let's move to the Risk Management segment and organic and EBITDAC tables on Pages 4 and 5. Another fantastic quarter benefiting from new business wins and excellent client retention, 13.3% organic growth and margins at 20.6%. Looking forward, we are now lapping growth associated with our large new business wins from '23, and so we see quarterly organic for the rest of '24 in the 8% to 9% range. As for margins, the team has done a great job posting margins above 20% this quarter, and we believe we can hold that for the remainder of the year. That also is a bit better than our March IR Day outlook. \n Turning to Page 6 of the earnings release, in the corporate segment shortcut table. Adjusted first quarter numbers came in better than the favorable end of our March IR Day expectations due to lower acquisition costs and some favorable tax items, primarily associated with stock-based compensation, and that's shown in the corporate line. \n So now let's move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. Not much changes at all on Page 3 or 4 other than a few tweaks to a few numbers such as FX, noncash items, et cetera. Just do a double check with your models using these numbers. \n Page 5 updates our tax credit carryforwards. It shows about $820 million available at March 31, and that we would be -- that we are benefiting our cash flows about $150 million to $180 million a year. Doesn't flow through our P&L, but still a nice annual cash flow benefit to help us fund future M&A.  \n Turning to Page 6, the top table. Recall, we introduced this modeling helper in January. It breaks down the components of investment income, premium finance revenues, book gains and equity investments in third-party brokers. Not much has changed from what we provided in March but we are still embedding 225 basis point rate cuts in the second half of '24. And we've also updated for current FX rates. \n The lower table on Page 6 is rollover revenues. Blue column subtotal of about $228 million is very close to the $224 million we provided at our March IR day.  And remember, the pinkish columns only include estimated revenues for M&A through -- that we've closed through yesterday. So just a reminder, you'll need to make a pick for future M&A. \n Also a little housekeeping. When you read Note 3 on that page, you'll see we had an estimate change related to some historical acquisitions that causes the gross up of revenues and expenses. It nets close to nothing, but it does flow through the P&L. We've adjusted these out, so there's no impact to organic adjusted net earnings or adjusted EBITDAC or adjusted EPS. \n Moving to cash, capital management and M&A funding. Available cash on hand at March 31 was around $1 billion, which includes a portion of the proceeds from our February debt offering. So with $1 billion in the bank and expected strong future cash flows, we are still estimating we have total capacity in '24 of about $3.5 billion to fund M&A without issuing stock nor having to borrow much of any more.  \n As for 2025, it looks like we could fund over $4 billion of M&A with free cash and debt, all of this while maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. Okay. Another terrific quarter and start to the year. Looking ahead, we see continued strong organic growth, a growing pipeline of M&A, further opportunities for productivity improvements and a culture that makes us hard to beat. I believe we are very well positioned to deliver another fantastic year here in '24. Back to you, Pat. \nJ. Gallagher: Thank you, Doug. Operator, I think we're ready for some questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. \nElyse Greenspan: My first question is on the brokerage segment. So organic, as you guys said, right, a bit better than what you expected in March. So close to the top end of the full year guided range, right, that you guys are maintaining that outlook, could you just give us a sense, do you expect growth to slow over the balance of the year? Is there some level of conservatism?  \n I mean, Pat, you seemed positive on the pricing environment. We saw a little bit like GDP numbers today come out. I'm just trying to think about how you put that all together and how you would think growth would trend within brokerage over the next 3 quarters. \nJ. Gallagher: Well, I'm going to let Doug do the numbers. But yes, I mean, I think you're reading me right, Elyse. I'm bullish on the environment. We are not seeing a downturn in terms of our clients. They're employing more people. We're seeing robust client activity at Gallagher Bassett. That's a very good bellwether of what's going on in the economy.  \n Interest rates are up. The market hates inflation, but it's good for brokers and high interest rates help us as well in terms of the growth in revenues and head count and all the rest of it. So the fundamental business environment is really, really good for us. As far as the numbers, Doug, go ahead. \nDouglas Howell: Yes. Listen, we don't see much difference in each quarter going forward. We think we'll be in that 7% to 9% range, Elyse. We do have a large first quarter and it is heavily weighted to reinsurance. So you would naturally expect us to -- if we're going to be in that range, that maybe the first quarter is a touch above the next 3 quarters, but I wouldn't say it's anything meaningful. \n And so we're in that 7% to 9% range each of the next 3 quarters, which would bring us in, in that range for the full year. So really nothing different than what we've talked about the last couple of times we've been with you. \nElyse Greenspan: And then the second one is on margin, right? So a little bit, like you said, the Q1 was a little bit better than the March guide, but you previously had said, right, 100 basis points in the -- all three  quarters. Now it's 90 to 100 and the full year guide seems unchanged. Is it just maybe Q1 was a little bit better so now you're taking some of that to invest internally? I know it's a little nitpicky because it's still 90 to 100, but just trying to kind of square the updated out-quarter margin view with what you told us in March. \nDouglas Howell: Well, listen, I think that the CFO commentary document has kind of said 90 to 100, I think, consistently. If I said 100% of the last IR Day, I may have said towards 100 basis points. So I think our guidance feels, to us, about the same. \nElyse Greenspan: Okay. And then one last one. The FTC, right, is looking to potentially remove noncompetes from -- I guess my question is two-pronged from both the ability, I guess, to bring folks into Gallagher and also considering the potential to lose talent to other players, how do you think this could impact the company if it does actually go through? \nJ. Gallagher: Well, let me comment on that one. First of all, I think everybody saw that the U.S. Chamber has filed a lawsuit in Texas that's challenging this, and we're supportive of the Chamber's efforts. We think it's an overreach by the executive branch. \n But having said that, if the new rules actually hold up, there's a count in noncompete agreements as part of the sale of the business. And so we see that rule is having a little impact, really, on our M&A strategy. And that's -- when it first came out, that was kind of my concern. Our agreements with our production staff do not contain noncompete provisions, rather we use non-solicitation clauses. \n And there is a fine line difference there, but those cover clients and employees. And from our first look, we think those are going to remain enforceable. Having said all that, we want people to want to work here. The reason, this is why culture is so important. This is a great place to work, and we attract highly motivated salespeople and entrepreneurs that are passionate about doing what they do, and they want to leverage their expertise and capabilities.\n And we give them the data and analytics and the centers of excellence to work with. We arm them with way better armament that they get from being part of a local competitor. We're a great place to work. So while I don't agree with the FTC, and I do agree with the Chamber's position, we're supportive of that, for our business, I think it's a nonissue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. \nMichael Zaremski: Just as a quick follow-up on the FTC question. One of the top 10 brokers is on record saying that their California margins are a bit lower than the rest of the rest of the regions due to a little bit higher turnover, which might be due to [ Cali ] not having non-solicited noncompetes. Just curious, have you ever sliced and diced your California margins? And are they a little bit lower than the rest of the company? \nJ. Gallagher: Sliced and diced every margin by every possible measure you can think of. And no, they're not a bit lower. We've been trading in California for 50 years. We love the state, we're big, big there, and our people love working there. \nMichael Zaremski: Okay. That's clear. Switching gears to M&A. You guys -- and I've asked this in the past, but I'll just keep asking, because these are big numbers. So Doug, you said $4 billion of capacity for next year. That's clear. But these are just big numbers, $3.5 billion this year, $4 billion next year. Does this imply, if you look at, like, the top 100 list of brokers, I know that's just U.S., there's lots of overseas stuff. But just -- should we be thinking that you guys do some chunkier size deals as time progresses to be able to kind of fully deploy cash and debt? \nJ. Gallagher: Mike, this is Pat. I think it's fair to say that when opportunity presents itself, we're not afraid. I mean, 10 years ago, we stepped up and bought Wesfarmers out of Australia for $1 billion. That was the biggest play we'd ever made, and had, in fact, some financing for it that's worked out incredibly well.\n I think our purchase of Willis was somewhere on the order of -- Willis Re was somewhere on the order of $4 billion. And last year, we spent a good bit as well. So we're not afraid to look at chunkier deals, but you hit on it. There's 100 top 100. There happens to be 29,900 in the United States alone that are smaller than that. That's where our activity is based most of the time. \nDouglas Howell: Yes. I think -- Mike, this is Doug. I think that we have a chassis now that we can bring on a lot of smaller acquisitions, nice family-owned businesses that realize that they can be better together with us. I think that our M&A integration process is pretty smooth, very refined, 700 deals over the last 20 years. So we've got that down. \n And I think more and more, smaller or local brokers are realizing they can get the resources from us overnight that they've been wanting to have for maybe 20 years. So I think we have an advantage right now that family-owned broker now sees that they get to join us. This is their forever home. \n They don't have to sell into a different model that maybe will flip them or sell them to a different owner or break them apart in order to get value. They see that what's being talked about of capabilities is real inside of us. And sometimes when they go to another quarter for them, they're saying what they're going to do versus what they have done. \n So I think that we have the opportunity to increase the volume of that nice tuck-in deals that we see out there. And I think that our story is getting stronger and stronger every day. Higher interest rate, it does not help others reinvest into their business. We reinvest so much into our business day in and day out. \n There are new ideas for tools and capabilities and the others just can't say that. They haven't done it. I don't think they're going to do it in a higher interest rate. So I think the volume of our tuck-in deals will increase. Will we spend $3.5 billion this year and $4 billion next year. Yes, maybe we'll see. I think we've got a good shot at it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Motemaden: But Pat, I wanted to just talk about your comments you made on the property insurance side and on clients looking to add incremental coverage or limits and just how I can think about that as a potential offset to some of the moderation in property insurance pricing that you were talking about as well. Just help me think about the -- both of those factors and sort of how to think about that moderation and the impact that could have on your organic growth in the future. \nJ. Gallagher: Well, first of all, I think that when you look at that, those were in the section of the prepared remarks that had to do with reinsurance. There's been a lot of demand the last number of years for cat covers and what have you that frankly were hard to meet. And that's why we talk about the fact that it was more orderly this 1/1. We were able to complete what people wanted more or less. \n But there has been an appetite for more cover there that buyers and sellers have walked away from. But I think as we start to see pricing stabilize, become more predictable, that allows it to flow into their rating structure, et cetera. There's demand for more cover on their part, and we're meeting that demand. And I think that is offsetting some of the potential. \n Now remember, we didn't see property rates come down this quarter. What we're saying is that the increase moderated. So I think that there's kind of -- on the retail side, if you're a retail buyer -- and remember, most of our book of business is the commercial middle market. Don't get me wrong, we do a lot of risk management business, but these tuck-in acquisitions and the like that we're doing are clearly middle market players. Those people don't have a lot of choice. They're buying full cover at higher prices. And if that moderates a bit, it's good for the client. \nDouglas Howell: Interestingly, David, we have -- we're seeing rate increases and the exposure unit increases in the middle and smaller market greater than we did in the larger account size whereas, say, you go back a year or so ago, it might have been just the opposite. So we're starting to see -- if you're talking about some rate moderation and the increase, it's starting to pick up a little bit in the middle and small market space.\n The second thing is, remember, if the rate moderates, our customers are very good about opting out of coverage or as much coverage as rates go up and then opting back in for coverage to buy more when rates are coming down. So we've never captured the full increase of the rate and we won't suffer the entire give back if rates moderate a little bit. So there's that opt in, opt out. We haven't really talked about that much in the last 5 years or so. But we're seeing customers opt back in to buy more coverage if there are some moderation in the increase of the rates. \nJ. Gallagher: Also on the property side, back to that, David, you've got -- many years were 0 interest rates, not the last couple, but 0 interest rates left the schedules pretty much untouched. So you do have underwriters now being much more disciplined around the values, and that's pushing values up. So we've got the benefit of more values being insured in the property business.\n And my prepared remarks basically pointed out that property was up nearly 10% this quarter. So we're not seeing rates dropping. We're seeing rates go up in property a little less viciously. Now having said that, if the wind blows this fall, we're 1 month away from the start of the hurricane season, I'm just telling you all bets are off. I don't know what's going to happen. So for our clients sake, I hope that we have a benign season. \nDavid Motemaden: No, thanks for that. And yes, I do -- I was referring also, and you guys answered it, just the primary market, the moderation there. It is interesting to hear more about sort of that opt-in which I have not thought about. So that is helpful to hear about that. And then if I could just add 1 more, just 1 more question. \n So it sounds like there were some large life sales that came through towards the end of March. Was that a pull forward from future quarters? Or I guess, sort of outlook on the pipeline of the life sales and just how that -- how you're thinking about that throughout the rest of the year. \nDouglas Howell: As probably more of the -- if you remember, in December, we had some push out of the fourth quarter. So I would say it might be more catch-up than it is pulling from the future. And we're talking about $5 million on a $3 billion revenue quarter. So it was -- it's not meaningful in any of our numbers. The difference. We love the business, but it's not -- it doesn't make a big difference in any of our numbers. \nDavid Motemaden: Got it. So that was in your sort of outlook range that you gave in March. So the upside this quarter was not just solely from the life sale? \nDouglas Howell: That's right. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Hughes with Truist Securities. \nMark Hughes: Pat, did you give the breakout for open brokerage versus the MGA or binding business within the wholesale? \nJ. Gallagher: I did not. \nDouglas Howell: You got about 16% open brokerage this quarter. \nMark Hughes: And then with the binding, I think it's been running mid-single digits. Is that\u2026 \nJ. Gallagher: Higher than that. So more like 10%, 11%. \nMark Hughes: Okay. And then anything on the workers' comp side? Or just waiting for signs of life there in terms of frequencies, severity, pricing? Is it more of the same? Or do we have some reason to think it could be in selecting? \nJ. Gallagher: No, I think that's really interesting, Mark. In my career, that line has been, at times, pretty darn cyclical, and it is just as flat as a pancake. It's just going along. You might see 2 here, 3 there. And it's really just kind of flat. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Katie Sakys with Autonomous Research. \nKatie Sakys: First, just kind of wanted to touch on the margin expansion guidance for the full year. If organic revenue growth were to come in higher than the current guide, whether that comes from the wind blowing and property rates reaccelerating or for something else, how much of that would you guys kind of envision letting fall to the bottom line? Like, should we expect to see greater margin expansion? Or are there other areas of investment opportunities that you guys would kind of like to see some progress made on. \nDouglas Howell: Well, listen, I don't think that our investment opportunities would be rolled out fast enough in order to spend more going into if we had to pop up in organic growth and starting in August, if something -- the wind blows or something like that. So I don't think we would have the ability even to ramp up on some of the -- some big investment opportunities to offset that additional organic growth.\n But I'm trying to do some mental math here. If we're up another 0.25 point in organic, it might produce another, in a quarter, to $10 million or $15 million if we had it for half a year, something like that, if I'm doing my math right. So I don't think -- it would probably naturally improve the margins a little bit. \n I want to make sure we go back and clarify the question within wholesale, right? When you combine [ binding ] and programs, 11%. The programs are really more running around 2% to 3%. And open brokerage is in that 16% range. So just to make sure that we -- I answered 1 question, Pat has answered a combined question and just to break those 3 out, 16%, over 10% and low single digits on the program side. \nKatie Sakys: It's a helpful clarification. Just maybe as a quick follow-up. In terms of benefits from head count controls and client-related expense saves, are those things that you expect to persist as the year goes on? Or are those more specific to 1Q in particular? \nDouglas Howell: Listen, I think the team does a really nice job of looking at our head count controls. We have work model that show how many people we need to have, how many do we have. Do we need to hire in July, August and September, we can kind of forecast that. \n Our retention's been very good. I got to say that when you look at it, our retention is better today than it was, let's say, in '18 and '19. So I think we've done a really nice job of taking care of our employees throughout this inflation period. So we're not seeing significant terminations here.\n So overall, I think our work planning models and our ability to kind of forecast retention has helped us not have to push and pull on the joystick there to see how many more we need to bring on, how many do we need to take off. So it's pretty steady right now. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. \nYaron Kinar: I just want to touch on a couple of market questions, if I could. I think in the prepared remarks, you were talking about general liability and retail being up, like, 9%. If I go back to the investor meeting from, like, a month or so ago, I think you were talking about maybe seeing liability lines moving up to the 9%, 10% range over the course of 1 year or 2. So are you -- are we talking apples-to-apples here? Or are you surprised by the magnitude of improvement that you're seeing in liability lines right now? \nJ. Gallagher: I think -- let me go back to my prepared remarks. We've seen umbrella in the quarter, up 9%, which is kind of in line with what we're talking about in March. GL 7%, and that's where I think probably we've got to look at our carriers and say, are there going to be some reserve challenges going forward. So the 7% seems pretty -- it seems pretty stable. Maybe there'll be a push up a bit. And package, which is, of course, property and liability together at 8%; where comp, really not much, 2%. I think that feels like it's going to be there for the year. I think you could take our March discussions and kind of update them 6 weeks later for those numbers. \nDouglas Howell: There's a tone of concerns that seems to be louder today in our interactions with carriers and clients around casualty rate adequacy. So I would say that what we were chatting about in January and February seems to be louder today -- that confirms to be a little bit louder today. And so I think that -- and we're just -- I don't know if I have enough data yet to say absolutely that there was a tone shift in March in our data compared to what we were seeing in January and February. \n But when you look at some isolated situations, you boil that down with what we all read. When you combine that with what we hear in meetings with the carriers, we feel that casualty rates probably are more likely going up again in the next 3 quarters -- each of the next 3 quarters than we would see going down by any means. So there is a tone shift there. I just can't quite see it 100% in our data yet, but it seems like it's coming. \nYaron Kinar: That makes sense. I appreciate the color. And then -- and I apologize if you've already addressed this, and I missed it. But we saw the stamping office data come out in March around E&S flows and in the [ REITS ]. And it seems like it was a little bit of a surprise and disappointment.\n How much of that do you think is noise? Are you seeing that slowdown in your wholesale business? Or is that real? And sorry, or is that just noise and you're kind of looking past that and still see a very strong E&S market? \nJ. Gallagher: That is noise. Our E&S business is on fire. We are seeing submissions come in. We're renewing our business. I don't have any caution on that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. \nMeyer Shields: I was hoping to start on the reinsurance side. I think you talked about 13% organic growth. And is there any way of breaking that down between maybe the increasing limits that are being purchased versus market share wins versus pricing? \nJ. Gallagher: I don't have the actual stats on that. \nDouglas Howell: Well, listen. I will tell you this that we had a terrific new business quarter. Our teams are working together. I think we're starting to see some nice wins of working with our retailers on that. When you go down -- we were hearing a lot of great stories about teams settled in. When we look back and see it and try to measure our success on doing that merger. Our teams are working together. We're selling more new business. \n Our retention seems to be pretty darn good on that. And I think the fact is customers are buying some more cover while you're seeing a little price stability maybe. So we're checking the box on everything that we've considered to be this to be a successful merger. \nMeyer Shields: Okay. That's helpful. And second question, and clearly, I guess, the premise is we're not seeing any successful pressure on the part of carriers to reduce commission percentages. I was hoping you'd update us on efforts that are being made, even if they're not successful. \nJ. Gallagher: No. I think that our partners are being very reasonable. We're not we're not having a lot of headbutting on that subject at all. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cox with Goldman Sachs. \nRobert Cox: So I think in March, at the Investor Day, you guys were pretty optimistic on the potential for reacceleration in RPC in the remainder of 2024 due to higher exposure to property business and less workers' comp and the potential for casualty pricing increases. Is that still the case? Or is the property rate environment, with a little deceleration in the rate of increase, made you change your view a little bit? \nJ. Gallagher: No, I think our view is unchanged. We're very bullish. \nRobert Cox: Okay. Okay. Got it. And then maybe sort of a similar question in some ways. But if we strip out reinsurance, is the touch lower organic guide for the remainder of the year the same? Or do you think ex reinsurance, what would you say, for the trend of organic growth ex reinsurance? \nDouglas Howell: Well, yes, I think just because reinsurance is a little more skewed seasonally to the first quarter, it did help us, let's say, get from 8% to 8.9% this quarter, right? We do have some pretty good April 1 renewals coming in, so we'll see that in the second quarter. So I think we'll get the benefit of reinsurance a little bit in the second quarter, even though it's not as big percentage-wise as the total amount of our revenues. \n And then in the third and fourth quarter, we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens with the wind. Hopefully, there's not a shake anywhere else in the world. But right now, that's why I say, I feel pretty comfortable each quarter in that 7% to 9% range because reinsurance did help, but it wasn't like it moved us from 6% to 9%. It moved us up 75 basis points, something like that this quarter. \nRobert Cox: Got it. And if I could sneak 1 more in. In the Brokerage segment, could you remind us how much you're reinvesting in the business annually and what you're spending it on? \nDouglas Howell: Well, it's a laundry list. I mean, first, you start with our people. I think that our training, our development, our internship program, I think bringing on more producers, we are seeing lots of interest in joining Gallagher by experienced producers out there. I think they see that the organization has a lot to offer for them. \n Then the next thing you'd look at is technology. We're spending a ton on technology that both enables us to sell more, right, enables us to service better. Those numbers are probably -- the projects on the sheet could be $75 million, something like that. When I look at this year's budget, some of that's capital, some of that is operating expense. \n Like, [ looking ] back, we're spending about $75 million a year on cyber today. If you go back 5 years ago, we were spending about $15 million on that. So the fact that we're investing in infrastructure improvement, cyber and other infrastructure improvements. Then you get down into the data and analytics. We are hiring more and more people every day that help us slice and dice our data, look at industry statistics and bring a better delivery of that data through a digital platform to our customers.\n My guess is we're spending $30 million a year on those efforts. And then you look at AI now. There's starting to be a lot of AI projects inside of the company that are starting to deliver some yield. And so we're spending $5 million a year kind of on AI-related activities out there. So you add all that up, it can get to $200 million to $300 million pretty quickly in what we think we're doing to make a better franchise going forward. \nJ. Gallagher: I'd like to emphasize what Doug -- I've got a lot of listeners on this call. I'd like to emphasize where Doug started this. Most of that spend is, in one way or another, directly related either to making our service offering to our clients better, and we happen to know, for instance, that our digital offerings from small accounts through the risk management accounts, connectivity, things like Gallagher Go or even a middle market client can see what their policies are, what's going on with their buildings, et cetera, et cetera, are being incredibly well received.\n And we're rolling things out like that literally every quarter, so that's spend. And then you get into the data and analytics. And if you'd asked me 5 years ago, clients would really care that much about being able to tell them what people like you buy? Oh my God, they care. And then they want to know the rate structure and they want to know why.\n And when I started -- when I was selling insurance day to day, I tell them they had a good deal because Hartford quoted and so did CNA. Buy the cheaper one, let's move on. Or I'd have a reason why they should stay where they were, but I don't [ have ] capability of saying, here's what's happening in the world market. It's incredible.\n And remember what we said in our prepared remarks, 90% of the time our people go out and they're fighting against somebody who's substantially smaller and doesn't have any of this, let alone $200 million to $300 million to reinvest in more of it. I mean, it's just -- it's an incredible advantage. I appreciate the question. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi. \nMichael Ward: Kind of a similar question, but specifically on reinsurance. Just curious where you guys are in terms of the innings of getting that business where you want it to be. \nJ. Gallagher: It's really where we had dreamed it would be. The team is incredibly solid. We're not having defections. We've got -- what's been fun about that is that there's a remarkable interest in having continued relationships and building relationships with the retail side of the house, which is what we predicted. \n We predicted it, we did it that we would be, not only getting data and analytics, but we'd be working together, and we've seen that impact on existing, for instance, pooled accounts that were the biggest and probably the longest running pooling broker in the country, especially in the public sector business, been incredibly helpful, the dialogue back-and-forth. That's just 1 example. \n But -- and the business now I think they really feel like they're part of the enterprise. They're not the new kids anymore. There's always a period when you come to school and you're the new kid. You're the new kid, right? Well, that's not it anymore. I mean, you see them in the hall, they recognize the retailers, they recognize me, Doug, whatever. And the opportunities to invest in data and analytics there and the thirst for that from their clients, tremendous opportunities, and it's working out incredibly well. \nMichael Ward: And then maybe just one last one on group benefits. Kind of curious if you can sort of discuss how the renewals have gone and how top line is trending from your perspective. And I guess the -- what's the tone like among the customer base in terms of health of the economy and then hiring and labor? \nJ. Gallagher: Well, interestingly, like, the tone from our clients is there's a large amount of concern. And we're sitting with clients that, a, in some instances, don't know why they have turnover. And we're able to get in and do some data analytics around what's going on with them and where -- what's going on there. So a very deep concern about wanting to hold on to their top people. \n We also have an awful lot of people just trying to attract people to fill jobs. Pick stuff off of racks, serve tables, whatever, and that's difficult. So they're trying to differentiate themselves in that regard. And there's a lot of concern on their part around cost. Medical inflation is real. Those costs get passed directly back to the employer. Then you've got the whole problem of inflation. Inflation is difficult. \n So I think what it's doing is it's making our professionals far more valuable than the local person that comes out and says there are 4 of us in the office and we're really good at this, and let me show you a PPO and maybe I can get another quote for your insurance. That's just not cutting it anymore. And that's not -- I'm not talking about 5,000 live cases here. The people that are employing 100, 150, 200 people, they need this kind of help. So it's a very robust period for us, and it is a difficult time for employers. Where are they going to get the right people to fill the jobs and then how do they hold on to them. \nOperator: And our last question is coming from Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. \nMichael Zaremski: Just a quick follow-up. You guys always give color on umbrella, lots of people do. Just curious, is there any way you can dimension what percentage of your business is umbrella? \nDouglas Howell: I can dig it out. Did you have a second piece of that? \nJ. Gallagher: Do you have another question, Mike? We'll dig on that for a second. \nMichael Zaremski: No, I -- that was my only question. \nJ. Gallagher: We're looking here. \nDouglas Howell: So let's see, in '23, I would say, it makes up 6% of our business. \nJ. Gallagher: Well, I think that's it for questions. If I can just make a comment here. Thank you again for joining us this afternoon. And I would like to thank our 53,000 colleagues around the world for their efforts. Their hard work and dedication is evident when we report another fantastic quarter of growth and profitability. \n As I look ahead, I remain very bullish on our prospects and believe we are well positioned to deliver another excellent year of financial performance. We look forward to speaking with the investment community at our IR Day. Thank you again for being with us this evening. Have a nice evening. \nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "J. Gallagher",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter '24 earnings call. On the call with me today is Doug Howell, our CFO; and other members of the management team and the heads of our operating divisions. We had a great first quarter to begin 2024. \n For our combined Brokerage and Risk Management segments, we posted 20% growth in revenue, our 13th straight quarter of double-digit growth, 9.4% organic; Virgin acquisition rollover revenues of approximately $250 million. We also completed 12 mergers totaling nearly $70 million of estimated annualized revenue. Reported net earnings margin of 21.5%, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 37.8%, GAAP earnings per share of $3.10 and adjusted earnings per share of $3.83, up 17% year-over-year. So another terrific quarter by the team. \n Moving to results on a segment basis, starting with the Brokerage segment. Reported revenue growth of 21%. Organic growth was 8.9% and about 10% if you include interest income. Adjusted EBITDAC was up 18% year-over-year. And we posted adjusted EBITDAC margin of 39.9% a bit better than our March IR Day expectations. \n Let me give some insights behind our Brokerage segment organic, and just to level set, the following figures do not include interest income. Our global retail brokerage operations posted 7% organic. Within our P/C operations, we delivered 7% in the United States, 6% in the U.K., 2% in Canada and 8% in Australia and New Zealand. And our global employee benefit brokerage and consulting business posted organic of about 8%, including some large live case sales that were completed in late March.\n Shifting to our reinsurance wholesale and specialty businesses, overall organic of 13%. This includes Gallagher Re at 13%, U.K. specialty at 10% and U.S. wholesale at 13%. Fantastic growth, whether retail, wholesale or reinsurance. \n Next, let me provide some thoughts on the PC insurance pricing environment, starting with the primary insurance market. Global first quarter renewal premiums, which include both rate and exposure changes, were up about 7%. Renewal premium increases continue to be broad-based, up across all of our major geographies and most product lines. \n For example, property was up nearly 10%; umbrella, up 9%; general liability, up 7%; workers' comp, up 2%; package, up 8%; and personal lines, up 13%. So many lines are seeing sizable increases. There are 2 exceptions within professional lines. First, D&O, where renewal premiums are down about 5%; and second, cyber, where renewal premiums are flattish. \n These 2 lines appear close to reaching a pricing bottom, but combined, represent around 5% of our P/C business globally. So overall, our clients continue to see insurance costs increase, but our job as brokers is to mitigate these increases and deliver comprehensive insurance programs that align with their risk appetite and fit their budget.  \n Moving to the reinsurance market. First quarter dynamics were dominated by the January 1 renewal season where we saw stable pricing and increased demand for property cat cover. Reinsurers continue to exercise discipline and met the increased client demand with sufficient capacity. Importantly, the team was able to secure many new business wins while retaining most of our existing clients. \n During April renewals, reinsurance carriers maintain their discipline, and with increased demand and stable pricing, we saw more coverage being purchased. Within property, more capacity was available at the top end of programs and the quoting of renewal process was disciplined and predictable. \n The casualty treaty market saw stable pricing overall. However, carriers able to differentiate themselves through good management of prior year reserves were able to secure better reinsurance placements. Specialty class renewals were a bit more complex with some changes in terms and conditions. However, many clients were able to secure modestly lower pricing. \n With that said, the tragedy in Baltimore may cause reinsurance carriers more pricing [ resolve ] throughout the rest of the year. Those interested in more detailed commentary on January or April renewals can find our first new market reports on our website.  \n In our view, insurance and reinsurance carriers continue to behave rationally. Carriers know where they need rate by line, by industry and by geography. We are seeing this differentiation in our data. Premiums are increasing the most, where it's needed to generate an acceptable underwriting profit. Great example of this is primary casualty, where we are seeing renewal premiums moving higher.  \n Global first quarter umbrella and general liability renewal premium increases are in the high single digits, including 9% increases in U.S. retail. A. M. Best recently maintained its negative outlook on the U.S. general liability insurance market due to worsening social inflation, medical expenses and litigation financing. We've been highlighting these dynamics for a while, along with hearing concerns around historical reserves, which leads us to believe further rate increases are to come in casualty.\n At the other end of the spectrum, we have property. As insurance and reinsurance carriers believe they are getting closer to price and exposure adequacy, we are seeing property renewal premium increases moderating. With that said, first quarter insurance renewal premiums were still pushing double digits. As we look out for the remainder of the year, increased frequency or severity of catastrophes could again move the market in '24.\n And while capacity was very challenging to come by during '22 and '23, we are now finding, when clients are looking to add coverage or limits, carriers are more than willing to provide additional cover. Notably, we are not seeing a change in the underwriting standards from our carrier partners. \n While continued premium increases seem rational to our carrier partners, our clients have experienced multiple years of increased costs, having a trusted adviser like Gallagher to help businesses navigating a complex insurance market by finding the best coverage for our clients while mitigating price increases. That's what we do.  \n Moving to our customers' business activity. Overall, it continues to be solid. During the first quarter, our daily indication showed positive midyear policy endorsements and audits ahead of last year's levels across most geographies. So we are not seeing signs of a broad global economic slowdown.  \n Within the U.S., the labor market remains tight. Nonfarm payrolls continue to increase and more people are reentering the workforce. Yet there continues to be nearly 9 million job openings. Wage increases have persisted at the same time, medical cost trends are rising. With these dynamics, employers are focused on total rewards strategy to help them achieve their human capital goals while reining in costs. That's why I believe our benefits businesses will have a terrific opportunities in '24.  \n Overall, we continue to win new brokerage clients while retaining our existing customers. In fact, our new business production has been on an upward trend in recent quarters, and our retention is holding. We believe this is a direct reflection of our client value proposition, CORE360 and Gallagher Better Works, our niche expert service and our data and analytics.  \n Don't forget, we're competing with someone smaller than us, 90% of the time. These local brokers just can't match the value we provide. So putting it all together, we continue to see full year '24 brokerage organic in the 7% to 9% range, and that would be another outstanding year.  \n Moving on to our Risk Management segment, Gallagher Bassett. Revenue growth was 19%, including organic of 13.3% and rollover revenues of $14 million. Adjusted EBITDAC margins were 20.6%, up 140 basis points versus last year and a bit better than our March IR Day expectations. Our results continue to reflect solid new business, outstanding retention, continued increases in new arising claims across both workers' comp and liability and resilient customer business activity.  \n Looking forward, we continue to see '24 full year organic in the 9% to 11% range as our larger '23 new business wins have been fully onboarded. We now expect full year margin of approximately 20.5%. That would also be another outstanding year.  \n Shifting to mergers and acquisitions. We had an active first quarter completing 12 new mergers, representing about $70 million of estimated annualized revenue. I'd like to thank all of our new partners for joining us and extend a very warm welcome to our growing Gallagher family of professionals. \n Looking ahead, our pipeline remains strong. We have around 50 term sheets signed or being prepared, representing around $350 million of annualized revenue. Good firms always have a choice, and we'll be very excited if they choose to join Gallagher.  \n Let me conclude with some comments regarding our bedrock culture. It's a culture that has remained constant through the decades of incredible growth. This is largely due to the 25 tenants of The Gallagher Way, which is entering its fifth decade next month. It is deeply rooted in the values of integrity, ethics and trust, which have been guiding us since 1927.\n Our culture is not just a differentiator, it's a competitive advantage. It attracts the right talent to our organization and the best merger partners and enables us to build enduring relationships. What makes me particularly proud is that I witness our culture in action every day as our employees demonstrate their commitment to our clients, and that is The Gallagher Way. Okay. I'll stop now and turn it over to Doug. Doug? Thank you, Doug. Operator, I think we're ready for some questions. Well, I'm going to let Doug do the numbers. But yes, I mean, I think you're reading me right, Elyse. I'm bullish on the environment. We are not seeing a downturn in terms of our clients. They're employing more people. We're seeing robust client activity at Gallagher Bassett. That's a very good bellwether of what's going on in the economy.  \n Interest rates are up. The market hates inflation, but it's good for brokers and high interest rates help us as well in terms of the growth in revenues and head count and all the rest of it. So the fundamental business environment is really, really good for us. As far as the numbers, Doug, go ahead. Well, let me comment on that one. First of all, I think everybody saw that the U.S. Chamber has filed a lawsuit in Texas that's challenging this, and we're supportive of the Chamber's efforts. We think it's an overreach by the executive branch. \n But having said that, if the new rules actually hold up, there's a count in noncompete agreements as part of the sale of the business. And so we see that rule is having a little impact, really, on our M&A strategy. And that's -- when it first came out, that was kind of my concern. Our agreements with our production staff do not contain noncompete provisions, rather we use non-solicitation clauses. \n And there is a fine line difference there, but those cover clients and employees. And from our first look, we think those are going to remain enforceable. Having said all that, we want people to want to work here. The reason, this is why culture is so important. This is a great place to work, and we attract highly motivated salespeople and entrepreneurs that are passionate about doing what they do, and they want to leverage their expertise and capabilities.\n And we give them the data and analytics and the centers of excellence to work with. We arm them with way better armament that they get from being part of a local competitor. We're a great place to work. So while I don't agree with the FTC, and I do agree with the Chamber's position, we're supportive of that, for our business, I think it's a nonissue. Sliced and diced every margin by every possible measure you can think of. And no, they're not a bit lower. We've been trading in California for 50 years. We love the state, we're big, big there, and our people love working there. Mike, this is Pat. I think it's fair to say that when opportunity presents itself, we're not afraid. I mean, 10 years ago, we stepped up and bought Wesfarmers out of Australia for $1 billion. That was the biggest play we'd ever made, and had, in fact, some financing for it that's worked out incredibly well.\n I think our purchase of Willis was somewhere on the order of -- Willis Re was somewhere on the order of $4 billion. And last year, we spent a good bit as well. So we're not afraid to look at chunkier deals, but you hit on it. There's 100 top 100. There happens to be 29,900 in the United States alone that are smaller than that. That's where our activity is based most of the time. Well, first of all, I think that when you look at that, those were in the section of the prepared remarks that had to do with reinsurance. There's been a lot of demand the last number of years for cat covers and what have you that frankly were hard to meet. And that's why we talk about the fact that it was more orderly this 1/1. We were able to complete what people wanted more or less. \n But there has been an appetite for more cover there that buyers and sellers have walked away from. But I think as we start to see pricing stabilize, become more predictable, that allows it to flow into their rating structure, et cetera. There's demand for more cover on their part, and we're meeting that demand. And I think that is offsetting some of the potential. \n Now remember, we didn't see property rates come down this quarter. What we're saying is that the increase moderated. So I think that there's kind of -- on the retail side, if you're a retail buyer -- and remember, most of our book of business is the commercial middle market. Don't get me wrong, we do a lot of risk management business, but these tuck-in acquisitions and the like that we're doing are clearly middle market players. Those people don't have a lot of choice. They're buying full cover at higher prices. And if that moderates a bit, it's good for the client. Also on the property side, back to that, David, you've got -- many years were 0 interest rates, not the last couple, but 0 interest rates left the schedules pretty much untouched. So you do have underwriters now being much more disciplined around the values, and that's pushing values up. So we've got the benefit of more values being insured in the property business.\n And my prepared remarks basically pointed out that property was up nearly 10% this quarter. So we're not seeing rates dropping. We're seeing rates go up in property a little less viciously. Now having said that, if the wind blows this fall, we're 1 month away from the start of the hurricane season, I'm just telling you all bets are off. I don't know what's going to happen. So for our clients sake, I hope that we have a benign season. I did not. Higher than that. So more like 10%, 11%. No, I think that's really interesting, Mark. In my career, that line has been, at times, pretty darn cyclical, and it is just as flat as a pancake. It's just going along. You might see 2 here, 3 there. And it's really just kind of flat. I think -- let me go back to my prepared remarks. We've seen umbrella in the quarter, up 9%, which is kind of in line with what we're talking about in March. GL 7%, and that's where I think probably we've got to look at our carriers and say, are there going to be some reserve challenges going forward. So the 7% seems pretty -- it seems pretty stable. Maybe there'll be a push up a bit. And package, which is, of course, property and liability together at 8%; where comp, really not much, 2%. I think that feels like it's going to be there for the year. I think you could take our March discussions and kind of update them 6 weeks later for those numbers. That is noise. Our E&S business is on fire. We are seeing submissions come in. We're renewing our business. I don't have any caution on that. I don't have the actual stats on that. No. I think that our partners are being very reasonable. We're not we're not having a lot of headbutting on that subject at all. No, I think our view is unchanged. We're very bullish. I'd like to emphasize what Doug -- I've got a lot of listeners on this call. I'd like to emphasize where Doug started this. Most of that spend is, in one way or another, directly related either to making our service offering to our clients better, and we happen to know, for instance, that our digital offerings from small accounts through the risk management accounts, connectivity, things like Gallagher Go or even a middle market client can see what their policies are, what's going on with their buildings, et cetera, et cetera, are being incredibly well received.\n And we're rolling things out like that literally every quarter, so that's spend. And then you get into the data and analytics. And if you'd asked me 5 years ago, clients would really care that much about being able to tell them what people like you buy? Oh my God, they care. And then they want to know the rate structure and they want to know why.\n And when I started -- when I was selling insurance day to day, I tell them they had a good deal because Hartford quoted and so did CNA. Buy the cheaper one, let's move on. Or I'd have a reason why they should stay where they were, but I don't [ have ] capability of saying, here's what's happening in the world market. It's incredible.\n And remember what we said in our prepared remarks, 90% of the time our people go out and they're fighting against somebody who's substantially smaller and doesn't have any of this, let alone $200 million to $300 million to reinvest in more of it. I mean, it's just -- it's an incredible advantage. I appreciate the question. It's really where we had dreamed it would be. The team is incredibly solid. We're not having defections.

Do you have another question, Mike? We'll dig on that for a second. We're looking here. Well, I think that's it for questions. If I can just make a comment here. Thank you again for joining us this afternoon. And I would like to thank our 53,000 colleagues around the world for their efforts. Their hard work and dedication is evident when we report another fantastic quarter of growth and profitability. \n As I look ahead, I remain very bullish on our prospects and believe we are well positioned to deliver another excellent year of financial performance. We look forward to speaking with the investment community at our IR Day. Thank you again for being with us this evening. Have a nice evening."

            "name": "Douglas Howell",
            "content": "Thanks, Pat, and hello, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our earnings release. I'll comment on first quarter organic growth and margins by segment, including how we are seeing full year organic growth and margins in each of the next 3 quarters. Then I'll provide some typical comments on the modeling helpers we provide in the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website, and I'll conclude my prepared remarks with a few comments on cash, M&A and capital management.  \n Okay. Let's look to Page 2 of the earnings release. Headline, first quarter brokerage organic growth of 8.9%. That's a bit better than our March IR Day expectation of 8% to 8.5%. And remember, we exclude interest income. Including such, we would have shown about 10% organic growth. Looking ahead, we continue to see strong new business production and favorable client retention.  \n Combine that with further rate increases, a resilient economic backdrop and sticky inflation, our 2024 brokerage organic outlook is unchanged. We are still seeing full year organic growth in that 7% to 9% range. \n Moving to Page 4 of the earnings release, to the Brokerage segment adjusted EBITDAC table. First quarter adjusted EBITDAC margin was 39.9%, a bit better than our March IR Day expectations. The footnote on that page explains what we discussed in our January earnings call and again at our March IR Day. There is 90 basis points of roll-in impact from M&A, principally Buck, that naturally runs lower margins.  \n So on the surface, it is showing 30 basis points lower, but underlying margins actually expanded 60 basis points. Again, that improvement is a little better than what we forecasted in March. Let me walk you through a bridge from last year. First, if you were to pull out last year's 2023 first quarter, you would see we reported, back then, adjusted EBITDAC margin of 40.4%.\n Second, when we update that margin using current period FX rate, gets you to an FX adjusted margin of about 40.2%. And we've done that here. So you can see that in the 2023 column in this table. Third, deduct that the 90 basis point roll-in impact. Again, that's all due to the roll-in math. And let's -- just to be clear, these are not businesses with margins that are going backwards. \n So that gets you to 39.3%, Compare that to the 39.9% we show today, and that gives you the underlying 60 basis points of margin expansion. That is really great work by the team.  As we look ahead to the following 3 quarters of '24, it is looking like we could expand margins in the 90 to 100 basis point range in each of the next 3 quarters. Let me give you some flavor on that. \n First, as Pat said, Buck passed its 1-year anniversary, so that roll-in noise is behind us. Second, as discussed at our March IR Day, the carryover impact of raises given in 2023 is comparatively lesser over the next 3 quarters. And third, the reality is we are typically posting margins higher than most of our M&A targets. \n While that slightly impacts what we report as margin expansion, we will do these mergers all day, any day. These are great businesses with terrific talent. And when we combine, we are better together. So to repeat, expansion in 90 to 100 basis points range in each of the next 3 quarters would get you to about 60 basis points of full year margin expansion. That assumes we would post organic in that 7% to 9% range and it still is allowing us to continue to make substantial investments in data analytics, sales tools, digital service and arming our sales and service folks with the best resources in the business.  \n Okay. Let's move to the Risk Management segment and organic and EBITDAC tables on Pages 4 and 5. Another fantastic quarter benefiting from new business wins and excellent client retention, 13.3% organic growth and margins at 20.6%. Looking forward, we are now lapping growth associated with our large new business wins from '23, and so we see quarterly organic for the rest of '24 in the 8% to 9% range. As for margins, the team has done a great job posting margins above 20% this quarter, and we believe we can hold that for the remainder of the year. That also is a bit better than our March IR Day outlook. \n Turning to Page 6 of the earnings release, in the corporate segment shortcut table. Adjusted first quarter numbers came in better than the favorable end of our March IR Day expectations due to lower acquisition costs and some favorable tax items, primarily associated with stock-based compensation, and that's shown in the corporate line. \n So now let's move to the CFO commentary document that we posted on our website. Not much changes at all on Page 3 or 4 other than a few tweaks to a few numbers such as FX, noncash items, et cetera. Just do a double check with your models using these numbers. \n Page 5 updates our tax credit carryforwards. It shows about $820 million available at March 31, and that we would be -- that we are benefiting our cash flows about $150 million to $180 million a year. Doesn't flow through our P&L, but still a nice annual cash flow benefit to help us fund future M&A.  \n Turning to Page 6, the top table. Recall, we introduced this modeling helper in January. It breaks down the components of investment income, premium finance revenues, book gains and equity investments in third-party brokers. Not much has changed from what we provided in March but we are still embedding 225 basis point rate cuts in the second half of '24. And we've also updated for current FX rates. \n The lower table on Page 6 is rollover revenues. Blue column subtotal of about $228 million is very close to the $224 million we provided at our March IR day.  And remember, the pinkish columns only include estimated revenues for M&A through -- that we've closed through yesterday. So just a reminder, you'll need to make a pick for future M&A. \n Also a little housekeeping. When you read Note 3 on that page, you'll see we had an estimate change related to some historical acquisitions that causes the gross up of revenues and expenses. It nets close to nothing, but it does flow through the P&L. We've adjusted these out, so there's no impact to organic adjusted net earnings or adjusted EBITDAC or adjusted EPS. \n Moving to cash, capital management and M&A funding. Available cash on hand at March 31 was around $1 billion, which includes a portion of the proceeds from our February debt offering. So with $1 billion in the bank and expected strong future cash flows, we are still estimating we have total capacity in '24 of about $3.5 billion to fund M&A without issuing stock nor having to borrow much of any more.  \n As for 2025, it looks like we could fund over $4 billion of M&A with free cash and debt, all of this while maintaining a solid investment-grade rating. Okay. Another terrific quarter and start to the year. Looking ahead, we see continued strong organic growth, a growing pipeline of M&A, further opportunities for productivity improvements and a culture that makes us hard to beat. I believe we are very well positioned to deliver another fantastic year here in '24. Back to you, Pat. Yes. Listen, we don't see much difference in each quarter going forward. We think we'll be in that 7% to 9% range, Elyse. We do have a large first quarter and it is heavily weighted to reinsurance. So you would naturally expect us to -- if we're going to be in that range, that maybe the first quarter is a touch above the next 3 quarters, but I wouldn't say it's anything meaningful. \n And so we're in that 7% to 9% range each of the next 3 quarters, which would bring us in, in that range for the full year. So really nothing different than what we've talked about the last couple of times we've been with you. Well, listen, I think that the CFO commentary document has kind of said 90 to 100, I think, consistently. If I said 100% of the last IR Day, I may have said towards 100 basis points. So I think our guidance feels, to us, about the same. Yes. I think -- Mike, this is Doug. I think that we have a chassis now that we can bring on a lot of smaller acquisitions, nice family-owned businesses that realize that they can be better together with us. I think that our M&A integration process is pretty smooth, very refined, 700 deals over the last 20 years. So we've got that down. \n And I think more and more, smaller or local brokers are realizing they can get the resources from us overnight that they've been wanting to have for maybe 20 years. So I think we have an advantage right now that family-owned broker now sees that they get to join us. This is their forever home. \n They don't have to sell into a different model that maybe will flip them or sell them to a different owner or break them apart in order to get value. They see that what's being talked about of capabilities is real inside of us. And sometimes when they go to another quarter for them, they're saying what they're going to do versus what they have done. \n So I think that we have the opportunity to increase the volume of that nice tuck-in deals that we see out there. And I think that our story is getting stronger and stronger every day. Higher interest rate, it does not help others reinvest into their business. We reinvest so much into our business day in and day out. \n There are new ideas for tools and capabilities and the others just can't say that. They haven't done it. I don't think they're going to do it in a higher interest rate. So I think the volume of our tuck-in deals will increase. Will we spend $3.5 billion this year and $4 billion next year. Yes, maybe we'll see. I think we've got a good shot at it. Interestingly, David, we have -- we're seeing rate increases and the exposure unit increases in the middle and smaller market greater than we did in the larger account size whereas, say, you go back a year or so ago, it might have been just the opposite. So we're starting to see -- if you're talking about some rate moderation and the increase, it's starting to pick up a little bit in the middle and small market space.\n The second thing is, remember, if the rate moderates, our customers are very good about opting out of coverage or as much coverage as rates go up and then opting back in for coverage to buy more when rates are coming down. So we've never captured the full increase of the rate and we won't suffer the entire give back if rates moderate a little bit. So there's that opt in, opt out. We haven't really talked about that much in the last 5 years or so. But we're seeing customers opt back in to buy more coverage if there are some moderation in the increase of the rates. As probably more of the -- if you remember, in December, we had some push out of the fourth quarter. So I would say it might be more catch-up than it is pulling from the future. And we're talking about $5 million on a $3 billion revenue quarter. So it was -- it's not meaningful in any of our numbers. The difference. We love the business, but it's not -- it doesn't make a big difference in any of our numbers. That's right. You got about 16% open brokerage this quarter. Well, listen, I don't think that our investment opportunities would be rolled out fast enough in order to spend more going into if we had to pop up in organic growth and starting in August, if something -- the wind blows or something like that. So I don't think we would have the ability even to ramp up on some of the -- some big investment opportunities to offset that additional organic growth.\n But I'm trying to do some mental math here. If we're up another 0.25 point in organic, it might produce another, in a quarter, to $10 million or $15 million if we had it for half a year, something like that, if I'm doing my math right. So I don't think -- it would probably naturally improve the margins a little bit. \n I want to make sure we go back and clarify the question within wholesale, right? When you combine [ binding ] and programs, 11%. The programs are really more running around 2% to 3%. And open brokerage is in that 16% range. So just to make sure that we -- I answered 1 question, Pat has answered a combined question and just to break those 3 out, 16%, over 10% and low single digits on the program side. Listen, I think the team does a really nice job of looking at our head count controls. We have work model that show how many people we need to have, how many do we have. Do we need to hire in July, August and September, we can kind of forecast that. \n Our retention's been very good. I got to say that when you look at it, our retention is better today than it was, let's say, in '18 and '19. So I think we've done a really nice job of taking care of our employees throughout this inflation period. So we're not seeing significant terminations here.\n So overall, I think our work planning models and our ability to kind of forecast retention has helped us not have to push and pull on the joystick there to see how many more we need to bring on, how many do we need to take off. So it's pretty steady right now. There's a tone of concerns that seems to be louder today in our interactions with carriers and clients around casualty rate adequacy. So I would say that what we were chatting about in January and February seems to be louder today -- that confirms to be a little bit louder today. And so I think that -- and we're just -- I don't know if I have enough data yet to say absolutely that there was a tone shift in March in our data compared to what we were seeing in January and February. \n But when you look at some isolated situations, you boil that down with what we all read. When you combine that with what we hear in meetings with the carriers, we feel that casualty rates probably are more likely going up again in the next 3 quarters -- each of the next 3 quarters than we would see going down by any means. So there is a tone shift there. I just can't quite see it 100% in our data yet, but it seems like it's coming. Well, listen. I will tell you this that we had a terrific new business quarter. Our teams are working together. I think we're starting to see some nice wins of working with our retailers on that. When you go down -- we were hearing a lot of great stories about teams settled in. When we look back and see it and try to measure our success on doing that merger. Our teams are working together. We're selling more new business. \n Our retention seems to be pretty darn good on that. And I think the fact is customers are buying some more cover while you're seeing a little price stability maybe. So we're checking the box on everything that we've considered to be this to be a successful merger. Well, yes, I think just because reinsurance is a little more skewed seasonally to the first quarter, it did help us, let's say, get from 8% to 8.9% this quarter, right? We do have some pretty good April 1 renewals coming in, so we'll see that in the second quarter. So I think we'll get the benefit of reinsurance a little bit in the second quarter, even though it's not as big percentage-wise as the total amount of our revenues. \n And then in the third and fourth quarter, we'll see what happens. We'll see what happens with the wind. Hopefully, there's not a shake anywhere else in the world. But right now, that's why I say, I feel pretty comfortable each quarter in that 7% to 9% range because reinsurance did help, but it wasn't like it moved us from 6% to 9%. It moved us up 75 basis points, something like that this quarter. Well, it's a laundry list. I mean, first, you start with our people. I think that our training, our development, our internship program, I think bringing on more producers, we are seeing lots of interest in joining Gallagher by experienced producers out there. I think they see that the organization has a lot to offer for them. \n Then the next thing you'd look at is technology. We're spending a ton on technology that both enables us to sell more, right, enables us to service better. Those numbers are probably -- the projects on the sheet could be $75 million, something like that. When I look at this year's budget, some of that's capital, some of that is operating expense. \n Like, [ looking ] back, we're spending about $75 million a year on cyber today. If you go back 5 years ago, we were spending about $15 million on that. So the fact that we're investing in infrastructure improvement, cyber and other infrastructure improvements. Then you get down into the data and analytics. We are hiring more and more people every day that help us slice and dice our data, look at industry statistics and bring a better delivery of that data through a digital platform to our customers.\n My guess is we're spending $30 million a year on those efforts. And then you look at AI now. There's starting to be a lot of AI projects inside of the company that are starting to deliver some yield. And so we're spending $5 million a year kind of on AI-related activities out there. So you add all that up, it can get to $200 million to $300 million pretty quickly in what we think we're doing to make a better franchise going forward. I can dig it out. Did you have a second piece of that? So let's see, in '23, I would say, it makes up 6% of our business."
